MUMoffour Sandra Cheyne never thought she would find herself using a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" target="_blank">food</a> bankA hardworking secretary who never missed a day the 40yearold was left almost <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" target="_blank">penniless</a> after being forced to quit her job when she took maternity leaveWithin weeks her partner â a scaffolder â was laid low with a back injuryNow her son William just 16 weeks old is being fed using milk tokensAnd Sandra's welfare claim has been tied up in red tape for weeks forcing the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> to visit a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food bank</a> for the first timeThe story of this family's torment comes as the Daily Record launches a campaign to promote the work of Trussell Trust <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food banks</a> across Scotland Record ViewIt's called Feed a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">Family</a> for a Fiver and it means you can help with just one simple text messageWe aim to highlight the plight of the hundreds of hardpressed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">families</a> forced to visit <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food banks</a> every dayWhen the Record met Sandra she was exchanging vouchers for a threeday supply of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" target="_blank">food</a> to feed her husband and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a>âI've always worked and I feel ashamed and embarrassed that it has come to thisâ she saidâIf it wasn't for this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food bank</a> I don't know where my family would turnâ  George Osborne refuses to accept blame for scandalous rise in Scottish food bank reliance Sandra who was referred to the Glasgow South East <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">Food Bank</a> by the Benefits Agency has waited for weeks for her benefits to be processedâI always thought that if you worked and paid taxes the welfare system would act as a safety netâ she saidâInstead William's been getting milk vouchers and now I'm here todayâSandra was served by Audrey Flannagan a former <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_work" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Social_work" target="_blank">social worker</a> who volunteers at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food bank</a> which began more than three years ago as part of the Elim Church in Butterbiggins GovanhillReferrals rocketed from 700 in year one to 4300 last year and it is thought that figure is soaring again in 2015âWe have seen a big rise because of benefit wrangles and sanctions and people who are in work but are too poor to cover all their bills and pay for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" target="_blank">food</a>â said AudreySandra who had not worked for her employer long enough to qualify for maternity benefits admits she dreaded her visitâI can't thank the volunteers here enoughâ she said âThey have made this experience much better than I thought it would beâAs well as William Sandra originally from Shetland has <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a> aged 16 10 and fourShortly before she arrived Gwen Dempster 40 collected her third <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" target="_blank">food</a> parcelGwen hit rock bottom after her benefits were stopped in DecemberDespite suffering lung problems and anxiety she was declared fit to work by the Department for Work and Pensions and has been struggling ever sinceShe said âI don't know how I'm supposed to live I'm in a hotel at the momentâAt least I have a roof over my head but that's about it I get toiletries here too I simply don't have any money at allâGwen's cousin Kenneth Watson 41 has been supporting her where he can but his own benefits only stretch so farâMy money goes <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fasting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fasting" target="_blank">fast</a> when you think of heating other bills and debtsâ he said âI just can't afford <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" target="_blank">food</a> Without the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food bank</a> me and Sandra would likely starveâAs single claimants Gwen or Kenneth would typically get a threeday package consisting mostly of cereal soup beans meat pasta and tea bagsIn just 90 minutes more than 20 people passed through the doors of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food bank</a> many with childrenMany were too shy or embarrassed to speak about their plight but the brave few who chose to tell their stories praised the selfless work of the volunteersMuch of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food" target="_blank">food</a> is provided by Elim and other churches as well as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supermarket" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supermarket" target="_blank">supermarkets</a> and individual donorsVICIOUS benefit cuts and zerohour contracts have left thousands of Scots on the breadlineMany are disabled and have seen their benefits slashed or halted entirely after being reassessed as âfit to workâOthers are hardworking parents who struggle to feed their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">families</a> on low wages and insecure jobsToday the Record is teaming up with the Trussell Trust to help give struggling Scots a legupOur Feed a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">Family</a> for a Fiver campaign

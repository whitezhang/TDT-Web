A MUM has told how doctors used <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Viagra</a> in a desperate bid to save her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">dying</a> babyMedics tried the treatment as they battled to save the life of threeweekold Lewis McKain who was born with a serious <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" target="_blank">heart</a> conditionMum Cheryl and dad Joe had already said their goodbyes to Lewis when doctors told her that injecting <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Viagra</a> into the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Circulatory_system" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Circulatory_system" target="_blank">bloodstream</a> might save his lifeHe then became the first <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">baby</a> in the UK to receive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Sildenafil</a> â better known as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Viagra</a> â intravenouslyBut sadly they faced the heartbreak of having to say goodbye to their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">baby</a> a second time when the treatment failedCheryl said âHe was so tired and hadn't opened his eyes in daysâNot even a blink but when they told us it hadn't worked we went in and he opened his wee eyes and just looked at us for the first time in days and just shut his eyes and never opened them againâJust like he knew just like he was saying âIt's all right'âI wanted to take him home to die he hadn't been home but they said he would not make it out of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plastic_surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plastic_surgery" target="_blank">lift</a>âWe got five hours with him with no life support we hadn't held him like that since he was six days oldâWe just had him in between us on the bed cuddling himâThen we fell asleep For me that's the highlight of having a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">baby</a> that whole bit with everyone &shysnuggled up on the bed and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">baby</a> in between youâI just woke with this start and looked at him and I knew he was just about to take his last <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Breathing" target="_blank">breath</a>âI woke up Joe and we just looked at him and he just went I know it sounds crazy but it feels like he woke me and said â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">Mum</a> I need to go'â Cheryl 29 says she âwanted to go withâ <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">baby</a> Lewis when told her son would die But she kept going for the sake of her other children Tyler nine and fiveyearold CarysShe and husband Joe 31 from &shyCumbernauld have now started raising money to support young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sibling" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sibling" target="_blank">siblings</a> facing the same situation as their childrenDespite an uneventful &shypregnancy Cheryl suspected something was wrong with Lewis just days before she was due to be inducedHer <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" target="_blank">anxiety</a> was so bad the doctors decided to give her an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emergency_department" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emergency_department" target="_blank">emergency</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caesarean_section" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caesarean_section" target="_blank">ceasarean section</a> And even after he was born on July 10 last year the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" target="_blank">nurse</a> refused to accept her son was suffering from little more than a common condition known as TTNSix days after being born he was rushed to Yorkhill Hospital when his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" target="_blank">heart</a> swelled to twice it's size leaving him with a heartbeat of 220Lewis was eventually <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnosis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnosis" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dilated_cardiomyopathy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dilated_cardiomyopathy" target="_blank">dilated cardiomyopathy</a> which is caused by high pressure in the lungsDespite being placed on lifesupport his condition failed to improve and the pair were given the news there was nothing more that could be done on August 1Cheryl said âThey said he took his tube out and by the time they put another tube in they knew he was not going to survive off the machineâYou just never think something like this is going to happen He was just so tinyâThey were then given a ray of hope with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Viagra</a> treatment â but when that failed they realised there was nothing more that could be done Lewis's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">death</a> left both Carys and Tyler shattered and it is one of Cheryl's biggest regrets they never got to hold their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">baby</a> brotherShe now wants to help other families avoid that with Team Lewis who have already raised nearly &pound4000 to make life easier for families of sick <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">babies</a> with siblingsMany of their ideas are being piloted in the Princess Royal at the Royal &shyInfirmary but they hope to roll them out to Glasgow's other &shymaternity units soonThey have already donated carnival tickets to families and DVD players to YorkhillCheryl said âOur long term goal is to set up support for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sibling" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sibling" target="_blank">siblings</a> in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> so there's someone there to provide creative ways of explaining sick <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">babies</a> to brothers and sisters and some &shycounselling for themâEveryone throughout this has been fantastic but while there was plenty for the parents there was nothing for brothers and sistersâââFor more information about Team Lewis go to wwwfacebookcomTeamLewis14LEWIS suffered from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dilated_cardiomyopathy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dilated_cardiomyopathy" target="_blank">dilated cardiomyopathy</a> a condition that weakens the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" target="_blank">heart</a> muscleHis condition was particularly rare as it was in his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Right_ventricle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Right_ventricle" target="_blank">right ventricle</a> making it harder to treatThe heart chamber becomes expanded and weakened making it harder to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pump" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pump" target="_blank">pump</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood" target="_blank">blood</a> around the bodyThis causes <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulmonary_hypertension" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulmonary_hypertension" target="_blank">pulmonary hypertension</a> which raises <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_pressure" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_pressure" target="_blank">blood pressure</a> within the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulmonary_artery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulmonary_artery" target="_blank">pulmonary arteries</a> â the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_vessel" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_vessel" target="_blank">blood vessels</a> that supply the lungsIt was hoped the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Sildenafil</a>  the noncommerical name for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sildenafil" target="_blank">Viagra</a> â would relax the muscle cells in the walls of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_vessel" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_vessel" target="_blank">blood vessels</a> to his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lung" target="_blank">lungs</a> allowing them to become widerThis would have reduced the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pressure" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pressure" target="_blank">pressure</a> in these <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_vessel" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood_vessel" target="_blank">blood vessels</a> and allowed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood" target="_blank">blood</a> to flow more easily through themSadly the treatment did not work for Lewis

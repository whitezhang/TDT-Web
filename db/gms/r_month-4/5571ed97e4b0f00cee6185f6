target="_blank">Piper Cherokee</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_aircraft" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Light_aircraft" target="_blank">light aircraft</a> crashed into a remote hillside at Bein Nan Lus on the northern aspect of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Glen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Glen" target="_blank">Glen</a> Kinglas above Loch Etive south of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oban" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oban" target="_blank">Oban</a> on Saturday afternoonThe plane went off <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radar" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radar" target="_blank">radar</a> at 150pm and a huge air land and sea search for the missing <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" target="_blank">Tiree</a> Community Council said the couple who died were only in their thirties and added &quotIt's absolutely tragic what has happened it's very sad especially with them coming home for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Easter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Easter" target="_blank">Easter</a> It's a major blow for the community&quotFamily and friends as is done in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" target="_blank">Tiree</a> will gather round to support Mrs Maclean in her grief&quotAnother <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" target="_blank">Tiree</a> resident added &quotMargaret Ann and her husband were coming up to stay with her family for the Easter weekend they had their own plane&quotShe went to school here but left the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Island" target="_blank">island</a> quite a long time ago she was a medical doctor&quotAn incident base remains at the emergency services rendezvous site at Inverawe which was packed with rescue service personnel and vehicles throughout the massive search on SaturdayIain MacKinnon Station Officer of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oban" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oban" target="_blank">Oban</a> volunteer Coastguard Team who was part of the group searching the shores of Loch Etive on Saturday said &quotAt the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loch" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Loch" target="_blank">loch</a> surface it was almost perfect visibility but in terms of using the rescue <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helicopter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helicopter" target="_blank">helicopters</a> they were very restricted because the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloud" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloud" target="_blank">cloud</a> was down to 100 metres it was way down on the hill particularly the area where the crash site is  that was over 700 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metre" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metre" target="_blank">metres</a>&quotThey took the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_rescue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_rescue" target="_blank">mountain rescue</a> guys as high as they possibly could dropped them on it the hill to walk up from there&quotHe added &quotThe problem with a plane crash is a plane is going quite fast if you are going at 60 mph on the road a plane will go at 100mph it's a fair impact at that kind of speed&quotAviation expert David Howitt who retired recently after managing the small airfield at Glenforsa on the isle of Mull for 50 years said the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" target="_blank">aircraft</a> appeared to have been on the normal route course for flight travel between Dundee and TireeHe said &quotI have a friend who comes from Dundee to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tiree" target="_blank">Tiree</a> it's a fair old way about 130 nautical miles and the plane was smack on course you would fly over from Tyndrum and come across the top of Loch Etive and then across the Sound of Mull&quotI have been taking <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weather" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weather" target="_blank">weather</a> readings here for fifty years and on Saturday the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weather" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weather" target="_blank">weather</a> was very very dubious there was some very poor visibility&quotHe said the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Cherokee" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Cherokee" target="_blank">Cherokee</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" target="_blank">aircraft</a> the couple were flying in was renowned as one of the most reliable light <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" target="_blank">aircrafts</a> and was often used for training purposesHowever Mr Howitt added that one possibility may have been that the plane had been flying above the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloud" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloud" target="_blank">cloud</a> level and had dropped down into the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloud" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloud" target="_blank">clouds</a> due to engine failureBut he stressed that until the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_Accidents_Investigation_Branch" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air_Accidents_Investigation_Branch" target="_blank">Air Accident Investigation Branch</a> had ascertained what happened noone could possibly knowMr Howitt added &quotThe sympathy of the aviation fraternity goes out to the family&quotAs forensic experts were airlifted to the scene of the crash police said that enquiries are continuing into the causeChief Inspector Fergus Byrne who is leading the enquiry said &quotSpecialist officers are at the scene and every effort is being made to recover the victims investigate the circumstances then remove the wreckage of the plane however the area is very remote and the crash site extensive and as such it will take a considerable amount of time to complete our work&quotAnyone with information regarding this incident is urged to contact police via the nonemergency number 101&quotTry your hand at our daily news quiz

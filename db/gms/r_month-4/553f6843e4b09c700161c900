TRAGIC Scott Chiriseri's parents tore themselves apart over their involvement with Walter Masocha's controversial <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religion" target="_blank">religious</a> sectTichakunda the boy's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priest" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priest" target="_blank">father</a> was a member of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregational_church" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Congregational_church" target="_blank">congregation</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stirling" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stirling" target="_blank">Stirling</a> â while his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother_Teresa" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother_Teresa" target="_blank">mother</a> Farai Chirashi attended some <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sermon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sermon" target="_blank">sermons</a> in 2013Friends later suggested his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">dad</a>'s deepening involvement with Masocha contributed to the breakup of his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" target="_blank">marriage</a> â a split which plunged Farai into a deep depressionZimbabweanborn Chirashi 32 went on to stab her son to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">death</a> last DecemberShe carried out the killing at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> home in Alva Clackmannanshire as part of what she believed was a â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missionary" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missionary" target="_blank">mission</a> from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a>âChirashi launched a frenzied knife attack on fiveyearold Scott as a young girl cowered terrified in the houseThe final text message she sent to a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friendship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friendship" target="_blank">friend</a> read âThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kingdom_of_God" target="_blank">Kingdom of God</a> is near <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Repentance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Repentance" target="_blank">Repent</a> and return to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a> and give your life to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jesus" target="_blank">Jesus</a>âEarlier this month the High Court in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> found her not guilty of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a> by reasons of insanityNow a former Agape insider has claimed some <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> members labelled the tragic mum as âdemonpossessedâ after her separationShe said âThe way they look at it if you don't want to be part of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> it means you have some <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demonic_possession" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demonic_possession" target="_blank">demon possession</a> or you're not right in the head â or you're being used by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devil" target="_blank">Devil</a> âWhen I joined the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> Tichakunda was already part of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> and Farai wasn't comingâHe was under pressure because his own <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wife" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wife" target="_blank">wife</a> wouldn't come to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a>âIt was something that was spoken of by Agape members at that timeâShe continued âHe wasn't the only oneâEven in my branch there was a man who had separated from his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wife" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wife" target="_blank">wife</a> and two kids because they wouldn't come to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a>âChirashi's close <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friendship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friendship" target="_blank">friend</a> Esther Wilson who grew up next door to her said the mumoftwo had no support after the breakup and it became âtoo much for herââSomething must have triggered that madness What that was I don't knowâ she saidâThe way they were doing things at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> was one thing Farai wasn't <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" target="_blank">happy</a> about Her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" target="_blank">husband</a> wanted the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> to join but she wasn't interested in itâThose people used to come to her house and hold Bible studies She didn't like thatâI think this all contributed to it In the end she had nobody around herâAnother <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friendship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friendship" target="_blank">friend</a> Simon Dick added âAgape say they are a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Christian_Church" target="_blank">Christian church</a> but they <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Worship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Worship" target="_blank">worshipped</a> the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> leader more than <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a>âIf someone questioned any of the church's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" target="_blank">teachings</a> they would be cut off They would ostracise youâThere is this idea that you will have <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evil" target="_blank">bad</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omen" target="_blank">omens</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" target="_blank">cast</a> against you People in this country don't believe that but for many Africans it is the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truth" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truth" target="_blank">truth</a> âIn this country that bad omen or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Curse" target="_blank">curse</a> would be what we call <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Depression_%28mood%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Depression_%28mood%29" target="_blank">depression</a>âNeighbours of the church's leader complained to Stirling Council in 2006 and alleged he had been performing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religion" target="_blank">religious</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceremony" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceremony" target="_blank">ceremonies</a> in his and nearby gardensOne claimed he saw an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" target="_blank">exorcism</a> taking place on his front lawn Masocha denied it and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synod" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Synod" target="_blank">council</a> took no actionA <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> spokesman said yesterday that they held âlaying on of handsâ <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Healing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Healing" target="_blank">healing</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceremony" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ceremony" target="_blank">ceremonies</a> but rejected the use of the word â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" target="_blank">exorcism</a>âThe claims are supported by Masocha's deaconess victim who told a court that she left Agape after members of her own <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> tried to have her sectionedShe said âI entered this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> happily <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" target="_blank">married</a> and I came out being told that I was demonpossessedâI was there for just over two <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> and I ended up losing my house and my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" target="_blank">marriage</a>âI lost everything and I am still trying to rebuild my life after what happened to me in AgapeâMy husband and I were like any <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Happiness" target="_blank">happy</a> and normal young couple He was very committed to me to the children and was a loving family manâBut I didn't want to go to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> because we were always broke and were spending too much money on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a>âBecause I said these things I was pronounced as mentally unwell or possessed by MasochaâThey tried to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" target="_blank">exorcise</a> me a few <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caste" target="_blank">cast</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demon" target="_blank">demons</a> out of meâShe explained that Masocha's followers would often conduct <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" target="_blank">prayer</a> meetings in the house which she owned with her husbandAnd they would travel the length of the UK to listen to Masocha at various conferencesIt was during one such âconferenceâ in Swansea that she was forced into an exorcismShe said âI was listening to it and I just turned and said to my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" target="_blank">husband</a> âI am not doing this any more I want to go out and sit in the car' âSo I left the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Service_of_worship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Service_of_worship" target="_blank">service</a> and was followed by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pastor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pastor" target="_blank">pastors</a> They took me back and locked me in a bedroom where they <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Exorcism" target="_blank">exorcised</a> me against my willâShe continued âI even had the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pastor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pastor" target="_blank">pastor</a> doing all sorts of things to me I had men restraining me touching me where they shouldn't be touching meâMy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dignity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dignity" target="_blank">dignity</a> was stripped away from meâThe woman claims that when she finally did leave the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> after her assault her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" target="_blank">husband</a> was convinced by Masocha to separate from herShe explained âA <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" target="_blank">husband</a> cannot even take phone calls from his exwifeâYou cut her out completely You are not even allowed to speak with herâHer claims against Masocha were denied by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> members who rallied to back the selfstyled prophetShe explained âMy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Husband" target="_blank">husband</a> even wrote a letter to the police to say that I was lying and that I had <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mental_health" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mental_health" target="_blank">mental health</a> issuesâBut it was only when other people started coming forward such as the young girls they took this whole thing very seriouslyâThere are so many women who have similar storiesâSome of them are even so scared to come out I was just brave because I'd gone through the worstâIt had already happened to me my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dignity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dignity" target="_blank">dignity</a> was stripped and I thought âWhat have I got left to lose'â

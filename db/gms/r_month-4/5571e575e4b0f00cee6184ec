A FORMER <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" target="_blank">nurse</a> has become the first person in Scotland to trial a new bionic <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" target="_blank">leg</a> designed to help <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> get back on their feet after illnessRobert Flynn had an operation for a second brain <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumor" target="_blank">tumour</a> two years agoHe was left with mobility problems and normally walks with a stickBut he has been able to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walk</a> unaided for the first time in years after trying out the new device at a Hamilton <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinic" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinic" target="_blank">clinic</a> The 52yearold from Paisley said he is trying to increase his independence since having <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> for a potentially deadly brian <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tumor" target="_blank">tumour</a> He said âI last had <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> two years ago and I was left with severe leftsided weakness I used an antigravity <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treadmill" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treadmill" target="_blank">treadmill</a> first of all and started using the bionic <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" target="_blank">leg</a> around 10 weeks ago I can already feel the benefit My aim is to get some more of my independence backâThe AlterG Bionic <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" target="_blank">leg</a> is a batterypowered device which senses the person's intent to move and responds accordinglyThe makers say <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> who are learning to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walk</a> again will use it to enhance recovery Robert a former <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pediatrics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pediatrics" target="_blank">paediatric</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" target="_blank">nurse</a> had <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a> at just 12 and again at 15 It was during his treatment that he made the  decision to become a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" target="_blank">nurse</a> He said âThe other staff told me I would be good with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> It was a time when jobs were difficult to come by I <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Research" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Research" target="_blank">applied</a> through the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley with a reference from one of the consultants who was treating me and I got my first jobâ He was at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow_Coma_Scale" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow_Coma_Scale" target="_blank">Glasgow</a>'s Southern General Hospital before being moved to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill In 1999 Robert moved abroad to Riyadh Saudi Arabia but took <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" target="_blank">ill</a> again with a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" target="_blank">brain</a> bleedHe said âIt was almost as if I was drunk I was struggling with balance My condition was deteriorating I had a pinhole <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bleeding" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bleeding" target="_blank">bleed</a> and as each day passed I lost a little more balance and I had visual disturbanceâRobert recovered and completed his contract He was enjoying a period of good health until 2006 when a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain_tumor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain_tumor" target="_blank">brain tumour</a> was discovered He fought back to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" target="_blank">health</a> until he was struck down again five years later by another tumourHe said âWhen things started to go wrong this time I was checked a bit quickerâI had to have more <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Consultant_%28medicine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Consultant_%28medicine%29" target="_blank">consultant</a> warned that things might not go as well as beforeâ Between November 2012 and January 2013 he had to learn how to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walk</a> properly againHe has rightsided weakness and struggles with movementHe said âAfter my second <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> I was struggling to even get out of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bed" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bed" target="_blank">bed</a> Initially it was taking four members of the team to get me standing on my feet I used to get really angry I was just doing four stepsâSometimes I would find the song I'm Still Standing and play it as loud as I couldâ Gradually Robert's mobility improved but he was determined to keep motivated and try to recover as much as was  possible He was referred to Core <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_therapy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_therapy" target="_blank">Physio</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinic" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinic" target="_blank">clinic</a> where he first started using an antigravity <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treadmill" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Treadmill" target="_blank">treadmill</a> to build up <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_strength" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_strength" target="_blank">strength</a> before turning to the bionic legHe said âThe difference has been great My personal goals are to be able to gain more independence even if it means I still <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walk</a> with a stick âThe nearer I can go to the lowest level of support I need the better There is still a lot of work to do and some days are  better than others but I have great support from the team âI go twice a week I get some funding for it For me it is like going to the gym I used to love the gym and I see it as a form or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_exercise" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_exercise" target="_blank">exercise</a> and a way to socialiseâThe device is also aimed at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinal_cord_injury"

target="_blank">knee</a> surgeryThe makers say it can significantly help <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rehabilitation_%28neuropsychology%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rehabilitation_%28neuropsychology%29" target="_blank">rehabilitation</a> for mobilityimpaired <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient"

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg" target="_blank">Leg</a> has technology developed by NASAThe system uses <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Differential_diagnosis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Differential_diagnosis" target="_blank">differential</a> air pressure to reduce the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stress_%28biology%29"

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_therapy" target="_blank">physiotherapy</a> sessions to enhance training routines such as sittostand <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_exercise" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_exercise" target="_blank">exercises</a> and stair climbingWhen a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patient</a> begins to stand the sensors detect the weight shift and responds by either bending or extending the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg"

A FOOTBALLER who lost one of his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twin" target="_blank">twin</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">babies</a> and girlfriend just seven months apart has told how he and his surviving <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" target="_blank">daughter</a> are rebuilding their livesCowdenbeath <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promiscuity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promiscuity" target="_blank">player</a> Dean Brett's partner Gemma Porteous <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> in January after a brief battle with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a> She was 22The devastating blow came just months after one of the young couple's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" target="_blank">daughters</a> Mollie lost her fight for life four weeks after being born prematurelyDean and the surviving <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twin" target="_blank">twin</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> will be moving into a new home this weekend as the footballer bravely looks towards the futureOpening his heart about the double tragedy he said âI'll miss Gemma and Mollie every day for the rest of my life but <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> and I are going to be all right We're survivorsâYou have to just get on with it and I'm doing that I just live my lifeâBecause of what happened with Gemma and Mollie and both being so young you feel you need to do that for themâBut Dean admitted grief creeps up on him at the most unexpected momentsHe said âI was on a bus the other week going to physiotherapy and suddenly thought âThis time last year Gemma was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pregnancy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pregnancy" target="_blank">pregnant</a> Mollie and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> were born Gemma got <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a> and now they're both gone'âIt still doesn't feel real I do get annoyed sometimes but I try not to sit for hours thinking about everything that's happenedâI've got to be strong for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> but sometimes I look at her and see Mollie and Gemma in her I wonder what Mollie and Gemma are doing nowâ The 22yearold defender who is out with an ankle injury said ninemonthold <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> is his saving graceHe added âWhen <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> was wee she would just sleep But now she's starting to move about she's bored with everything in 10 minutesâIt's small things like going for a shower when she's awake that I worry about but I'm lucky that I do have a lot of supportâDean who is moving into a twobedroom <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_%28TV_series%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">house</a> close to his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" target="_blank">parents</a>' home in Tranent East Lothian said âMy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" target="_blank">parents</a> and Gemma's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" target="_blank">parents</a> are amazing Gemma's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a> and my cousin look after <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> for me so I can go to the gym and go to work But everything's got to be planned in advanceâI love being a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">dad</a> I've always been a happy positive person and I'm still the same person I try to be positive for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a>'s sakeâ Dean's world was turned upside down when the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Twin" target="_blank">twins</a> were born three months early last JuneTiny Mollie tried to cling on to life for four weeks but sadly didn't surviveDean said âI'd never lost anyone before Mollie It was hard when she <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> really hardâAfter she passed away she looked so beautiful and peacefulâShe'd been really ill but when I saw her in her little coffin she was beautiful It was a struggle to cope with her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">dying</a>â Still reeling from the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" target="_blank">death</a> of one of their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infant" target="_blank">babies</a> the young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parent" target="_blank">parents</a> were shellshocked when Gemma who had been suffering horrendous pain in her back and legs was diagnosed with spinal cancerIn September she was admitted to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> for an operation to remove the tumourShe remained there until the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" target="_blank">day</a> she <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> â apart from brief visits home for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a>'s first Christmas and on HogmanayDean said âIt all happened really quicklyâWe had been planning for the future as we never expected it to be so bad She was never really ill with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemotherapy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemotherapy" target="_blank">chemotherapy</a> and for a while things were actually looking all rightâShe never complained or asked âWhy me' She just got on with itâGemma never knew she was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">dying</a> but once or twice when we were talking about things she would say âWhat if I don't make it'âShe was in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> from September until she <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> in January but sometimes she would be lively for a few daysâI kept telling myself I was just going to wait and see because there was no point in me getting a wee bit of hopeâAs the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a> took a devastating hold of the young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a> she wasn't aware her condition had deteriorated and that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctors_%282000_TV_series%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctors_%282000_TV_series%29" target="_blank">doctors</a> had warned Dean to expect the worstHe said âI just told her she had an infection and she was really tiredâOn the Monday before she <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctors_%282000_TV_series%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctors_%282000_TV_series%29" target="_blank">doctors</a> said it was possibly a bleed to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_%28TV_series%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arthur_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">brain</a> or the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a> getting worseâI knew then in myself things were bad but I didn't say anything to my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a> or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a>âThe doctors and nurses at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cancer" target="_blank">cancer</a> unit in the Western General were amazing They tried so hardâPoignantly Dean said it's the âdaft thingsâ he misses most about GemmaHe said âI miss lots of things about her â even the things I used to moan about like tagging me in pictures on Facebook and stuff and now I miss itâEverybody loved Gemma She was so nice to everyone and she was a positive personâI wish she could see <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miami" target="_blank">Mia</a> and how beautiful she is and I wish she could see how I'm doing as a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">dad</a> But I know her and Mollie are with usâ

A huge surge in demand for Scotch whisky has sparked a project to grow extra <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> â in the NetherlandsFarmers who grow the crop there as a cereal or for beer production have been asked to turn over part of their land for whisky insteadWorldwide growth in consumption has forced Scots distilleries to look for alternative sources of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> â and experts say the clay soil in the north of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands" target="_blank">Holland</a> is idealNow a group of 30 farmers have signed up to grow for a firm which will malt the crop in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands" target="_blank">Netherlands</a> before distilling it in Scotland meaning it can still be described as authentic Scotch whiskyThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dutch_people" target="_blank">Dutch</a> farmers involved have sown 300 hectares for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> which will be harvested in August Production follows a pilot project last year which saw about 40 hectares in the region cultivated for Scotch whisky barleyAte Biljsma a farmer in the Frisian region said âScottish distilleries asked a malt company in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Netherlands" target="_blank">Holland</a> for help They approached a company called Agrifirm who asked us farmersâAte 52 who has farmed for 31 years in the village of Firdgum claims he's never tasted Scotland's national drinkHe added âWe hope the Scottish distilleries will be content with our way of producing and our <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quality_%28business%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quality_%28business%29" target="_blank">quality</a> so we can expand production for themâAgrifirm are giving us good advice such as what kind of fertiliser to use I have not tasted Scotch whisky but now I have a reason to do itâMalting <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> for whisky generates 10 per cent more in income than <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> for the beer industryMost <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> for Scotch is grown in Scotland but some is already grown in other countries including England According to latest figures the whisky industry is worth &pound5billion to the UK each year and supports more than 40000  jobs And although UK <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" target="_blank">sales</a> are falling â with the whisky <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Market_share" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Market_share" target="_blank">market</a> shrinking by nearly 10 per cent since 2009 â it has been offset by huge <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" target="_blank">sales</a> growth worldwide  <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" target="_blank">Sales</a> in Taiwan were up by more than a third last year to &pound197million while <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" target="_blank">sales</a> in India and the United Arab  Emirates were up by more than a quarter to &pound89million and &pound116million respectively <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sales" target="_blank">Sales</a> in Japan rose by nearly 10 per cent to &pound64million The biggest foreign markets by value are the US &pound750million <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_wine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_wine" target="_blank">France</a> &pound445million and  Singapore &pound201million  Rosemary Gallagher of the Scotch Whisky Association said âThe industry uses Scottish <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> when it can As a result nearly 90 per cent of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> used to produce Scotch is from Scotland âBut it's also important to source on the basis of available <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quality_%28business%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quality_%28business%29" target="_blank">quality</a> and quantity so Scotch whisky is produced to the high standards consumers expect We welcome any initiatives to help thisâIndustry expert Jim Murray author of the Whisky Bible said âSome people may have a problem with this from a romantic point of view but you have to look at it on a practical levelâI don't care whether the Scottish whisky industry buys its <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barley" target="_blank">barley</a> from Australia â it's how well they distil and how good their casks are that really matterâNo one was available for comment at

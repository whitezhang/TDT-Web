the world's sharpest menFormer St Andrews student Carl Emery who stumbled into <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailoring</a> by chance provides <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" target="_blank">bespoke</a> suits to many of the globe's richest peopleFootballers Wayne Rooney and Rio Ferdinand are clients as is exmidfielder and TV presenter Robbie SavageSnooker player Shaun Murphy horse trainer Paul Nicholls and Corrie actor Ryan Thomas are big fans tooCarl 36 who studied economics and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Management" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Management" target="_blank">management</a> at St Andrews also has Texas millionaires and Belarussian oligarchs on his booksWith many of the Sunday Times rich list queuing up for his dapper suits the clothier who is based in Alderley Edge Cheshire is becoming as popular as the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailors</a> on London's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savile_Row" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Savile_Row" target="_blank">Savile</a> RowCarl who travels all over the world fitting clients and handdelivering their finished suits even got <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" target="_blank">football</a> pundit Savage to star in one of his adsHe said âMy suits are popular with famous faces from the worlds of sports and entertainment A lot of the topflight footballers live in Alderley Edge so we are on their doorstepâWe were thinking up ideas for an advert for the 2014 World Cup and a designer sketched a guy with long hair posing in a white <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" target="_blank">suit</a> as the Christ the Redeemer statue in BrazilâThe drawing looked the spitting image of Robbie Savage By coincidence he was coming in that day to get measured and agreed to do it which was magicâI love doing Robbie's suits as he is always looking for something a little bit different for television He doesn't like to wear the same outfit too often so he puts a lot of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> our wayâKeen shinty player Carl added âWe also make Wayne Rooney's suits so I've been in his house a few times for fittings He's a lot leaner than you would think and a terribly nice guyâRio Ferdinand snooker player Sean Murphy and Edinburgh rugby star Alasdair Dickinson are also clients as is Aberdeen player Andrew DriverâIt's great when you see the stars photographed wearing your suits or appearing on TV It's a brilliant jobâ Carl â who is married to beauty therapist Leah â makes several trips a year to Texas where his suits are hot property and account for 20 to 25 per cent of his businessHe said âOne of my clients here owns an oil valve manufacturing plant in the States and recommended me His US friends can't get enough of our suits They like the Britishness of the service and love the whole James Bond lookâI have about 120 clients out there I fly out take measurements and go back out five weeks later to fit the suits and get the needed alterations madeâI also go to Minsk in Belarus where the oligarchs also love the English gentleman lookâCarl who uses some of the world's finest materials in his garments has three billionaires and quite a few millionaires on his booksHe said âThe most expensive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" target="_blank">suit</a> we make is around &pound3000 Prices range from &pound750 upwardsâI have worked with a lot of people on the Sunday Times rich list and they are not stupid â they want something reasonable You do not want a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" target="_blank">suit</a> that is &pound10000 and then are too scared to wearâBut he added âI was once asked to make a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" target="_blank">suit</a> from the wool of the vicuna These llamalike creatures live in the Andes thousands of metres above sea level and their wool can only be sheared once every three years or so The material alone cost &pound1000 and the gentleman paid &pound5000 for the jacket We had to be so careful with itâCarl who is planning to bring his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" target="_blank">bespoke</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> to Scotland relies heavily on Scottish fabrics and textilesHe said âWe get our cashmere from Johnstons of Elgin tweed from Hunters of Brora as well as Harris tweed and other luxury cloth from Holland &amp Sherry in PeeblesâI'm looking forward to expanding the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> into Scotland as it is an untapped marketâCarl whose mum Linda 64 dad Bruce 59 and brother Wesley 37 help run the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">firm</a> admits <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" target="_blank">bespoke</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailoring</a> is not a career he envisaged for himselfHe said âWhen I was at St Andrews I was always coming up with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> ideas I think I was destined to be an entrepreneur but I never dreamed I would one day find success in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailoring</a>âAfter uni I worked as a salesman for a company who supplied chair and bath lifts and then for a highend kitchen <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">firm</a>âOne day a customer told me he had a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailor</a> who came to his home and measured him for his suits because he didn't have time to go clothes shoppingâIt was a lightbulb moment I knew that's what I wanted to do and I got a job with international <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bespoke" target="_blank">bespoke</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailor</a> company Tom James and started measuring clients in their homes and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office" target="_blank">offices</a>âI realised there was a lot of money to be made and decided to start up my own <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> Harris And Howard in 2010âI bought a shop near my home in Alderley Edge I employ a team of dedicated <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tailor" target="_blank">tailors</a> who do all the cutting and sewing as unfortunately I could not even sew a button back on never mind make a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" target="_blank">suit</a> It's a real family businessâWe make 20 suits a week but hope to double that within the next few years Most clients average two suits a year but there is one who gets a new one every month It's an industry on the upâCarl who provided suits for several of the guests at Prince William's wedding in 2011 has one person he is desperate to have as a client â David BeckhamHe said âThe Beckhams' old house is just 30 seconds from my shop but they moved just before I started up He is such a fashion icon and the ultimate <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suit_%28clothing%29" target="_blank">suit</a> model I suppose it could still happenâ

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defender_%28association_football%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defender_%28association_football%29" target="_blank">defender</a> who was playing for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southampton" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southampton" target="_blank">Southampton</a> at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">time</a> was on a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life_support" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life_support" target="_blank">life support</a> machine for 10 days after an incident outside a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nightclub" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nightclub" target="_blank">nightclub</a> in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_people" target="_blank">English</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_City_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_City_F.C." target="_blank">city</a> left him with blood clots in his brain and a fractured skullEmma witnessed the horrific aftermath and saw Dan 28 being treated by paramedics before she was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rape" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rape" target="_blank">raped</a> in an unrelated incident just hours laterThe 27yearold says tracking the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">footballer</a>'s recovery helped her contact <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> and put her life back together And she has revealed the incredible <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bond" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bond" target="_blank">bond</a> the pair now shareEmma said âWhat we went through that night was horrific We're just lucky to be able to have that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bond" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bond" target="_blank">bond</a> I think it's really rare that people get that opportunityâI think the story's probably something you would expect to see in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/1979_in_film" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/1979_in_film" target="_blank">film</a> not something to happen in real life It's been <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazing_Stories" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazing_Stories" target="_blank">amazing</a>â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" target="_blank">Emma</a> was initially too terrified to report the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" target="_blank">attack</a> in September 2011 but followed Dan's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pain" target="_blank">painful</a> recovery and saw parallels with her own anguishShe finally found the strength to confide in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" target="_blank">friends</a> who persuaded her to report the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" target="_blank">attack</a> to policeA trip to see Dan play for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southampton" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southampton" target="_blank">Southampton</a> provided another turning point The Saturday before her attacker's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trial" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trial" target="_blank">trial</a> was due to begin also marked Dan's comeback match at St Mary's StadiumEmma said âI just found it weird because I was there when his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" target="_blank">attack</a> happened and then saw it on the news the next morning I just felt like I needed to check on him even though I didn't know himâI had never even been to a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" target="_blank">football</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">game</a> before It was the first time Dan had played since the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/September_11_attacks" target="_blank">attack</a> and it just clicked together from thereâThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" target="_blank">football</a> was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Therapy%3F" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Therapy%3F" target="_blank">therapy</a> and was a great way of letting out all my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anger" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anger" target="_blank">anger</a> shouting on the terraces with the other fans âThe next match I went to he signed a shirt I had brought with his name on it He seemed quite shocked because I don't think many people had shirts with his name so I carried on following his journeyâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" target="_blank">Emma</a>'s attacker was sentenced to six <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" target="_blank">prison</a> Her friend and football fan Mat Guy wrote a letter to Dan explaining how he had inspired herShe said âMat told Dan how he had been a kind of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Therapy%3F" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Therapy%3F" target="_blank">therapy</a> for me and we didn't expect anything from it But then Dan called and said he'd like to meet up It was surreal and crazy but <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazing_Stories" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amazing_Stories" target="_blank">amazing</a>âI didn't really say much because I was starstruck and just sat there smiling We've been in contact ever sinceâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" target="_blank">Emma</a> followed Dan's career as he moved from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southampton" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southampton" target="_blank">Southampton</a> to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bournemouth" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bournemouth" target="_blank">Bournemouth</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coventry" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coventry" target="_blank">Coventry</a> CityShe even travelled to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> to watch him play after he signed for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partick_Thistle_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partick_Thistle_F.C." target="_blank">Thistle</a> in August last yearEmma who is training to be a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychotherapy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychotherapy" target="_blank">therapist</a> added âHe was getting us free tickets to come and it's also just simple things like sending texts to each other to say Merry ChristmasâI asked him for a signed shirt for Mat's birthday and when it arrived it had been signed by the whole <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partick_Thistle_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partick_Thistle_F.C." target="_blank">Thistle</a> team <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partick_Thistle_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Partick_Thistle_F.C." target="_blank">Partick Thistle</a> have two new supportersâIt's really comforting but hard to explain We both know what happened to each other and we're both aware that we've come out the other side of itâDan who's recovering from keyhole surgery on his ankle said â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" target="_blank">Emma</a> and I will always be <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" target="_blank">friends</a> I read the letter and it was an unbelievable story and a massive coincidence that something happened to us both that nightâWhen I got to know her she confided in me and I tried to help her and bring her out of her character because she was really shaken upâI've seen her over the last couple of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> become outgoing and bubbly and back to what her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" target="_blank">friends</a> tell me is more like her normal selfâDan says he too struggled to get back to where he was before He added âI think <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emma_Frost" target="_blank">Emma</a> coaxed me along too Helping her through her experiences helped shed light on my own It was a tough process but I've come out the other side probably stronger albeit a bit older and it's helped me as a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" target="_blank">person</a> as well I like to help and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Support_group" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Support_group" target="_blank">support</a> othersâI'm really settled in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love" target="_blank">love</a> the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_City_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_City_F.C." target="_blank">city</a> and the people It's rekindled my love of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" target="_blank">football</a>â

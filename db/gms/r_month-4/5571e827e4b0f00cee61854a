 SCOTLAND should abandon the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_on_Drugs" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_on_Drugs" target="_blank">war on drugs</a> according to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Author" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Author" target="_blank">author</a> of a controversial bookJohann Hari believes the old approach of prohibition has failed and says decriminalising <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a> is the only answerHari spent three years on a 30000mile journey to write Chasing the ScreamThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" target="_blank">book</a> attempts to answer basic questions about <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a> and tackling addictionHari 36 believes support for the current <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_on_Drugs" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War_on_Drugs" target="_blank">war on drugs</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" target="_blank">policy</a> is collapsingHe said âI imagine Scotland doing what they did in Portugal where they decriminalised <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a>&quotYou can imagine the main parties getting a scientific panel to go away and figure it out and take it out of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics" target="_blank">politics</a> I think Scotland could be a testing ground for much more progressive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" target="_blank">policies</a>âThere are several ways the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drug</a> debate in Scotland could be more advancedâHe said his latest contribution to the debate does not mark a return from exileThe awardwinning <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journalist" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journalist" target="_blank">journalist</a> was suspended from his job as a columnist for The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence" target="_blank">Independent</a> over accusations he used other <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Writer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Writer" target="_blank">writers</a>' material without crediting them He was also accused of altering his Wikipedia entry and attacking others by using a pseudonymHe left to go to the US to undergo retraining but never returned to the paperInstead he wrote Chasing the Scream which has been lauded by critics including Elton John Stephen Fry and Naomi KleinSpeaking about his past errors he said âI made a serious error of judgement and it was a really foolish and unpleasant thing to do&quotWhen you screw up you should pay a price and go away and work diligently and I did&quothari who graduated with a double first from Cambridge University disagrees that the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" target="_blank">book</a> is a campaign tool and instead believes it simply tells the stories of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> whose lives had been changed by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War" target="_blank">war</a> on drugsThe stories range from a transexual <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illegal_drug_trade" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illegal_drug_trade" target="_blank">drug dealer</a> in Brooklyn searching for her mother to a startling <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Revelation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book_of_Revelation" target="_blank">revelation</a> about legendary singer Billie HolidayThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" target="_blank">book</a> starts with a journey on a Greyhound bus to Penn State University to find out about former Bureau of Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger who he credits with doing âmore than any other individual to create the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drug</a> world we now live in&quot He contends that Anslinger's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" target="_blank">policies</a> played a large part in Holiday's deathHari himself had an early exposure to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a> One of his first memories is of trying to wake âa relative in a drugged slumpâ and not being able toHe himself used Provigil  a narcolepsy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drug</a>  which allowed him to write uninterrupted without rest He is not narcoleptic â a condition that causes <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> to suddenly fall asleepHari said ending the current <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/War" target="_blank">war</a> will help to save thousands of livesHe explains âThere are enormous numbers of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> who are dying unnecessarily because of bad <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drug</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Policy" target="_blank">policies</a> When you ban <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a> they don't disappear&quotThey transfer from doctors to armed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crime" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crime" target="_blank">criminal</a> gangs Banning them creates a whole wave of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Violence" target="_blank">violence</a> that wouldn't existâWe need a broad menu of options to treat <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Substance_dependence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Substance_dependence" target="_blank">drug addiction</a> At the moment there are two things on the menu Narcotics Anonymous or methadone We have to have loads of things on the menuâBorn in Glasgow Hari grew up in London but spent summers and school holidays in Perth with his grandmother Amy McRaeAmy also helped to raise Hari and spent a lot of time in LondonHe said âMy mum grew up in Perth and later lived in Glasgow Years ago I was in New York to cover the Republican National Convention and I referred to myself as an Englishman in New YorkâShe rang and said âno son of mine is an Englishman' âMy grandmother was incredible She had a really hard life Her husband worked on the docks and he died young and she had to bring up three kids on her own&quotShe scrubbed toilets She was amazing When she was in her 80s my sister had a baby My gran was going to post her some money and she was crossing the road and was hit by a car in Perth&quotWhen the ambulance arrived the first thing she said to the paramedic was âcan you put this in the post box' My sister got this bloodstained money in the post&quotShe was always thinking about other people Within months she was walking again She was 91 when she died She was also militantly ScottishâHari's father was a bus driver while his mother worked in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Domestic_violence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Domestic_violence" target="_blank">domestic violence</a> shelterThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Writer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Writer" target="_blank">writer</a> said both his mother and grandmother were âalways on the side of the underdog'He added âFor my grandmother it seemed miraculous that I got into Cambridge A lot of my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Politics" target="_blank">politics</a> come from my gran and my mumâJohann said his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" target="_blank">book</a> is an attempt to ârehumanise <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a>'He added âI hope the overall effect is you want to change the way these <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> are treated I hope

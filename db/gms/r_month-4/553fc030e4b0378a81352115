themâOne represents the beginning of life and the other represents the endâ he said âAnd it is doubly sad when the two are so closely linkedâWe are deeply deeply saddened when the life of someone so young is cut short and in Karen's case so tragically and horrifically so by the curtain of deathâMs Buckley's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" target="_blank">local</a> parish church which holds 300 people wasn't big enough for the crowds that turned out to bid her a final farewell including those

untimely death was confusing for those who loved herâKaren's death seems so utterly inappropriateâ he added âIt violates our sense of orderâIn our view of life death and childhood are poles apart and twentyfour years simply does not seem the right time to die  it does not seem to add upâThe priest told the congregation at the Church of Saint Michael the Archangel that many things would now leave a void for her loved onesâIt may be a picture that hangs on the wall a familiar footstep a stray kitten whom Karen named Boots or whatever but nothing becomes so indispensable as a childâ he saidâFrom the outset he or she tangles his or her tiny fingers in our heart strings and when they are pulled away the hurt is indescribableâIt is an hour of heartache a time of tearsâDuring the service Ms Buckley's three brothers each placed a memento of their sister by her coffin as a reminder of her personality achievements and her love for lifeThe picture of her first day at the nearby Analeentha National School was a symbol of her lifelong love for learningThe uniform represented her as a kind and caring nurse âwhose smile would light up the wardâ her <a

Ed said âShe's an Australian who I met in a lovely wine bar in Fremantle where I liveâShe'd been recently divorced It was pretty much on the first week when she'd decided she was going to go out and start meeting people again That was nearly four years ago We were engaged within a few monthsâ Ed went on âIt really was love at first sight and ever since we met we feel as if we have been floating in a series of 50s and 60s romantic movies We feel like Grace Kelly and Carey Grant in the south of France and have Nat King Cole singing Nature Boy softly behind us all the timeâDonna told how she and Ed often exchange a line from the movie Moulin RougeShe said âThe greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love" target="_blank">love</a> and be loved in returnâIn real life Ed was a hero of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" target="_blank">Piper Alpha</a> He was one of the first men to escape the inferno and after being picked up by the Silver Pit standby vessel he worked tirelessly to save othersHe wrote a book about his experience and followed it up with an awardwinning <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/2004_in_film"

target="_blank">Piper</a> Speaking from Fremantle on the 25th anniversary Ed said âThis was the place I ran to to heal myself but my wounds have never healedâEven though I have watched footage of the night 100 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> I still get goose bumps I get a cold shiver that goes through my body every time I see itâThere were <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helicopter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Helicopter" target="_blank">helicopters</a> everywhere explosions noise fire an incredible smell of smoke all the time It was like being in the middle of a battle When I came back I was changed forever â I was one of only 62 survivorsâEd worked as a diver in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Sea" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/North_Sea" target="_blank">North Sea</a> for a decade He said âDiving was my life but <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" target="_blank">Piper Alpha</a> changed all thatâ One hundred and sixty seven people were killed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family_%28biology%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family_%28biology%29" target="_blank">families</a> left in tatters and yet the oil company <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occidental_Petroleum" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occidental_Petroleum" target="_blank">Occidental</a> were never prosecutedâA key witness at the Cullen Inquiry Ed said â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" target="_blank">Piper Alpha</a> was no accident it was a disaster waiting to happen In the boom of the 70s and early 80s <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piper_Alpha" target="_blank">Piper</a> was the world's most productive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_platform" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oil_platform" target="_blank">offshore platform</a>âBut the competitive ruthlessness of the oil industry bred a working culture which meant that nothing should stand in the way of pumping oil and gasâUnsafe working practices had turned the rig into a petrochemical timebomb â and the clock was tickingâ A few hours before the explosion work on a valve connected to a gas condensate pump had been suspendedIt had been removed but the nightshift control room staff didn't know When they were later forced to turn it on highlyvolatile gas condensate escaped and ignited triggering a series of explosions As the blazing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Platform_game"

inquiries&quotDetective Superintendent Jim Kerr from Police Scotland's major investigations teams stressed that the male was &quotnot a suspect&quotHe told the press conference &quotFrom what we can see she does not appear to be under duress there's no signs of a struggle or reluctance on her part to leave the club&quotHowever that does not mean that something untoward has happened to her at a later stage&quotHe added &quotThere was talk of another man she had been seen with We've also traced him we've spoken to him&quot Karen is described as white and around 5ft to 5ft 2in She has brown eyes and dark hair which had long black curly extensions in itWhen last seen she was wearing a black jumpsuit with red highheeled shoes and was carrying a black handbag She speaks with an Irish accentShe lives with three other student friends in a flat in Hill Street Garnethill Glasgow and earlier on Saturday evening had drinks with friends in the flat before going to the nightclub although her friends told police she was not drunkMr Kerr appealed for people to come forward with any information about the missing woman's whereabouts saying while it &quotmay seem insignificant to them however to us it may be the piece of information that leads us to finding her&quotHe said the public response so far had been &quotencouraging&quot adding &quotPeople really do want to help&quotHowever at this time we need the information about her whereabouts and her movements after leaving the club&quotMr Kerr said they are &quotgravely concerned&quot for the safety of Karen and are treating her disappearance as a highrisk missing person inquiryHe said that after leaving the club she and the man she was seen speaking to on CCTV travelled to his flat in Dorchester Avenue in the Kelvindale area in his carThe police officer said &quotWe've traced the man she was with in Dorchester Avenue He believes he was intimate with her at his flat consensually in the early hours of Sunday&quotShe was last seen when she left the flat at around 4am and was planning to walk home to her flat in Hill StreetPolice stressed the man is not being treated as a suspectA handbag which police believe belongs to Karen was found in Dawsholm Park near Dorchester Avenue early this afternoonThere has been no activity on her social media accounts in the last couple of days and her mobile phone is believed to be out of batteryPolice are also keen to find out more about a grey car that was seen on the roads between Milngavie and Drymen north of Glasgow between 11am and 3pm yesterdayMr Kerr said &quotThe activity of this grey car on the Monday is something that we're a wee bit concerned about This car has been seen at various locations on these roads and I want to know why&quotHe added &quotWe are gravely concerned that Karen has come to some harm whether that is down to foul play criminality or she has taken unwell or had an accident is obviously still to be established&quotPolice have also traced a second man who the student spoke to in the nightclub before she leftHer father John Buckley 62 was also at the press conference todayHe said &quotWe are extremely concerned for her We are desperate to get her back and safe with her family  she is our only daughter we love her dearly and just want her to come home safe and sound&quotMiss Buckley is a first year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian UniversityShe moved to Glasgow in February and before that was a nurse at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow EssexShe has three older brothers Brendan 32 Kieran 28 and Damian 27Police added that she has travelled widely abroad and is aware of how to take care of herselfHer father later described her as a &quotsensible girl&quotMr Buckley said &quotShe always keeps in contact with her family and friends to let them know where she is and what she is up to To not return to her flat or be in contact with her pals  not responding to texts and calls to her mobile is very very worrying as it is so out of character&quotMr Kerr added &quotKaren is a lovely girl close to her family and popular with her friends She has only been in Glasgow a few months and if staying out will always let her friends know  hence the real concern here&quotLike all youngsters she is also very active on social media but there has been no activity on any of her accounts since Saturday nightearly Sunday morning&quotThis is understandably a heartbreaking time for her family Of course there is an intense interest both from the public and the media regarding her disappearance however speculation particularly on social media about the aspects of the case are not helping our inquiry and is extremely distressing for Karen's family and friends&quot

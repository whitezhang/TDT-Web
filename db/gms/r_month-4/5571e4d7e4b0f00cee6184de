WITH her cheeky grin it's hard to believe little Madeleine Wynne was once just a few days away from being paralysedShe was just five years old when a scan revealed she had a tumour growing on her spinal cordA consultant told the family that another week and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Growth_hormone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Growth_hormone" target="_blank">growth</a> would have been so big she would have lost the use of her legs Madeleine now eight has since been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 NF1 a genetic condition where tumours â usually benign â grow on and inside the body Her parents David and Catherine are now campaigning to raise awareness of NF1 and want the telltale signs included in the red Personal Health Record book issued to every childThis would allow GPs to spot the signs and make an early diagnosis of the condition which affects one in 3000One of the key indicators of the condition is freckles or caf&eacute au lait marks on the body â something Madeleine had since she was 12 months old but no one realised their significance  David 42 a submariner from Helensburgh said âNF1 is more common than cystic fibrosis and motor neurone disease yet you are lucky if you can find a GP who has heard of it never mind make a diagnosis âMadeleine was a quiet baby who struggled to feed and had many developmental delaysâDuring many GP and hospital visits doctors commented on her unusual freckles but none made the connection to this genetic conditionâA diagnosis at this early stage would have meant the correct monitoring and signs of a slowgrowing spinal cord tumour which was trying to paralyse her would have been spottedâMadeleine was a clumsy child and was always falling over but the falls grew more frequent after she turned fiveIn July 2012 she complained of intense pain â but it was put down to a kidney infectionDavid also dad to Ellie 10 said âWe were told to bring her back after a week but just three days later Madeleine started struggling to walk and I took her up to A&ampE  âI will never forget having to carry her for an MRI scan with her screaming uncontrollably only to discover the truth â that she had a tumour attached to her spinal cord The consultant at Yorkhill hospital spotted  the caf&eacute au lait marks for what they were and she got the diagnosis of NF1â The tumour turned out to be nonmalignant but surgeons couldn't remove it completely because of its location and 18 months later it grew backDavid who's worked with NF1 charity Funny Lumps said âThis meant more surgery followed by 18 months of chemotherapy to shrink the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Growth_hormone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Growth_hormone" target="_blank">growth</a> and prevent it becoming malignantâHe added âDiagnosis of NF1 is poor at best We have encountered lots of children who have had similar problems of clinicians not spotting caf&eacute au lait marks for what they areâSome GPs prescribed antifungal cream for them and there have even been a few accusations of child abuseâA simple change to the child's red health record book to check for the telltale marks would go a long way to rectify this problem of diagnosisâ For more information on NF1 or the Funny Lumps charity go to wwwfunnylumpsorg

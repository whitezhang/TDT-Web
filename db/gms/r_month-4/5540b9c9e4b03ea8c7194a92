talking worldwide not just boxing fans It's superb for the sportâFlynn will be a fan this weekend but he is strictly business when it comes to his own careerCharlie Flynn in top form as he reveals how BALLET has got him fighting fitHis life has been turned upside down since winning gold in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow"

Thistle Hotel in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> on May 22The 21yearold relishes the roar of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scottish</a> crowd but admitted he also loves hitting the road to build his fan base around the UKHe said âI can't wait for May 22 I love fighting in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> in front of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scottish</a> crowds I really enjoyed going down to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" target="_blank">Newcastle</a> and fighting on the Anthony Joshua undercard Going around the country is something that's important to meâI know I have a good style that people like watching and it's good to entertain fans all around <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" target="_blank">Britain</a>âI'm hoping to get on a big show in July â probably on the undercard of Scott Quigg's WBA title fight â and that's what it's all aboutâYou want to build up a following in the UK and beyond If you are a boxing fan it doesn't matter where you are from because you want to see good fighters in the ringâFlynn doesn't need to work on his profile in his homeland The star of Glasgow 2014 gets mobbed on the streets these days â that's when he's not pounding themThe Wishaw youngster has signed up for the Great <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scottish</a> Run and although he racks up seven miles a day on the North Lanarkshire pavements he insisted no one should expect him to be among the frontrunners Flynn said âI'm excited to take part in the Great <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scottish</a> Run The â¨atmosphere was incredible at the start last yearâI must admit I don't really like team or group events I like to work on my own I was always like that when I was with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_national_football_team" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_national_football_team" target="_blank">Scotland</a> team Even in the sprints I didn't like competing with the other fighters even though I knew I would winâThat's why I love boxing it's one on one I'll kick about in the middle and keep my head down I do seven miles a day but I just plod it It's not a fast run â it's just to burn the fat and I find it quite relaxingâI do my fitness in the morning and get out on the road in the afternoonâHowever I could do with a set of steps in Wishaw to run up Rocky style It's not quite the same running up in front of Lloyds in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motherwell_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motherwell_F.C." target="_blank">Motherwell</a>â  The Great <a

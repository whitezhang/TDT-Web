SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has reiterated her opposition to Trident after a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_Captain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_Captain" target="_blank">group</a> of former <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defense_%28military%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defense_%28military%29" target="_blank">defence</a> chiefs warned it would be folly for the UK not to renew its <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank">nuclear weapons</a> systemThe Trident missile system and its associated <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submarine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submarine" target="_blank">submarine</a> fleet based on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HMNB_Clyde" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/HMNB_Clyde" target="_blank">Clyde</a> are due for renewal by 2028A decision on whether to replace all four Vanguardclass <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submarine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submarine" target="_blank">submarines</a> which carry the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missile" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missile" target="_blank">missiles</a> is expected to be taken next year and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Conservative Party</a> have made it clear they are prepared to spend &pound100billion on upgrading the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defense_%28military%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Defense_%28military%29" target="_blank">defence</a> systemHowever speaking at a business breakfast in Glasgow <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Minister_of_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_Minister_of_Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland's First Minister</a> made it clear she regarded Trident as a &quotstatus symbol&quot of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom" target="_blank">British state</a> and that she is implacably opposed to spending money on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weapon" target="_blank">weapons</a> of mass destructionSturgeon who joined <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Campaign_for_Nuclear_Disarmament" target="_blank">CND</a> when she was 16 said &quotI have opposed Trident and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank">nuclear weapons</a> generally for as long as I can remember &quotI just think that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weapon" target="_blank">weapons</a> that at the press of a button can wipe out huge swathes of civilisation are wrong And they are in my view morally wrong&quotInstead of renewing its <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank">nuclear weapons</a> system she said the UK should focus on conventional <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finnish_Defence_Forces" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finnish_Defence_Forces" target="_blank">defence forces</a> saying over the last 10 years or more these had been &quotcompromised by the obsession with the status symbol that is Trident&quotSturgeon added &quotBritain is an island we're a maritime nation yet since the Nimrods were decommissioned <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" target="_blank">Britain</a> does not possess a single maritime patrol aircraft&quotBefore Christmas in December last year there was a suspicion that Russian <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submarine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submarine" target="_blank">submarines</a> were patrolling in our waters&quotBritain had to call on America Canada France to come and check that out because we didn't have the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aircraft" target="_blank">aircraft</a> to do it ourselves&quotThat's a sign that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank">nuclear weapons</a> are not just morally wrong it's the wrong priority in terms of properly defending the country&quotShe argued that a large <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_Captain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Group_Captain" target="_blank">group</a> of SNP <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_Parliament" target="_blank">MPs</a> at Westminster could &quotforce a rethink on the irrational proposal&quot to renew Trident at a time when &quotresources are so scarce&quot She said &quotLet me make the view of the SNP crystal clear  if there is &pound100 billion to spend it should be <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment" target="_blank">invested</a> in health education and childcare it should be <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment" target="_blank">invested</a> in building a better future for our children not on new <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank">nuclear weapons</a>&quotSturgeon's comments came after 20 people including former GCHQ director Sir David Omand and the former head of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Navy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Navy" target="_blank">Royal Navy</a> Admiral Sir Jonathon Band signed a letter sent to the Times newspaper outlining why they believe Trident must be renewedThe letter stated &quotIn an uncertain world where some powers are now displaying a worrying faith in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nuclear_weapon" target="_blank">nuclear weapons</a> as an instrument of policy and influence it would be irresponsible folly to abandon <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" target="_blank">Britain</a>'s own independent deterrent&quot

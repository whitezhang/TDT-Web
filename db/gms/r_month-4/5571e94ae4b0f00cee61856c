FOR a month or more I covered the Kosovo crisis with Gordon plodding through the refugee camps of Macedonia and eating burgers in a rundown <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hotel" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hotel" target="_blank">hotel</a> while watching <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNN" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNN" target="_blank">CNN</a> on a loopWe worked together ate together drank together faced adversity together and bore witness to a dark chapter in world historyBut through it all no matter how bleak things got once the job was done Gordon could make us laugh until we could laugh no moreI know my experience reflects that of the many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journalist" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journalist" target="_blank">journalists</a> lucky enough to be a partner on Jacko's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Team" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Team" target="_blank">team</a> in the world's trouble spots and our own backyardGordon Jacko the Jackal was the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_United_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_United_F.C." target="_blank">man</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reporter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reporter" target="_blank">reporters</a> wanted at their back the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" target="_blank">photographer</a> who sweated blood for the shot no one else gotRecord <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" target="_blank">photographer</a> When you wanted a JOB done you called the JackalâOur former picture editor Stuart Nicol said Gordon was the best <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" target="_blank">photographer</a> he had ever worked with in ScotlandHe added âThe <a

target="_blank">work</a> graced every <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newspaper" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Newspaper" target="_blank">newspaper</a> both sides of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Borders" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Borders" target="_blank">border</a>âGordon's talent was immense his tenacity exceptional But it is the magnitude of his personality his generosity kindness and that laugh rooted in his belly that we will miss most of all  All you had to do with an icy subject was let Jacko defrost them with his charm <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freelancer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freelancer" target="_blank">Freelance journalist</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Harrison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/George_Harrison" target="_blank">George</a> Mair said âThere wasn't a bigger smile in the businessâFellow <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photographer" target="_blank">photographer</a> Paul Chappells said âIf I were in a trench in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Belgium" target="_blank">Belgium</a> in 1916 I'd want to be next to the Jackal He'd know the way out â or at least negotiate our free passage to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Switzerland" target="_blank">Switzerland</a>âGordon and I once got lost in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Greece" target="_blank">Greece</a> as we looked for the plush new home of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yugoslavia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yugoslavia" target="_blank">Yugoslav</a> tyrant Slobodan Milosevic When he rightly told me off for my abysmal navigation I snapped that he was always telling me he was a bloody orienteering championâYou've been like this all holidayâ he chided in the only <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cross-dressing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cross-dressing" target="_blank">cross</a> words we had sharedI collapsed into laughter Covering a war was no holiday but it sometimes felt like one with Gordon He had humanity and irrepressible humour in the bleakest situationsWhen we found the Milosevic mansion I chatted with the workmen while Gordon climbed the wall and grabbed his pictureThe potential wrath of a dictator's henchmen was never going to faze him

target="_blank">lion</a>â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_&_Schuster" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Simon_&_Schuster" target="_blank">Simon</a> recalled âOn one particularly memorable trip we were part of a fourman <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Team" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Team" target="_blank">team</a> sent to the northwest frontier of Pakistan â a breeding ground for the Taliban â in the immediate aftermath of 911âFrom the minute we touched down in Islamabad the Jackal was determined to try to achieve the impossible and sneak across the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Borders" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Borders" target="_blank">border</a> into <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan" target="_blank">Afghanistan</a>  âOur <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Translation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Translation"

steadfastly refused to take us into the lawless tribal areas towards the Khyber PassâGordon would have gone on his own if he'd known the wayâOn another assignment in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" target="_blank">Kenyan</a> capital Nairobi Gordon got the most hellish food poisoning and looked so grey and pasty that I told him to go to his bedBut he carried on working in blistering heat in the biggest slum in Africa playing with the kids and chasing the next pictureWhile I knew I could never do Gordon's job I always had the sneaking suspicion he could do mineHe was a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Everett_True" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Everett_True" target="_blank">true</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photojournalism" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photojournalism" target="_blank">photojournalist</a> who had a nose for a story as much as an <a

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_national_football_team" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_national_football_team" target="_blank">Scotland</a> Gordon covered all our news <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Minor_league_baseball" target="_blank">minor</a> the dreich and the dreary Nothing put him in a bad moodHe often wanted his own picture taken when he was on assignment so he could preserve the memories and the pleasure of doing a job he truly lovedKind words from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were among the tributes to him but the small cherished memories of so many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" target="_blank">friends</a> colleagues and strangers <a

target="_blank">rock</a> as alwaysGordon's talk always came back to wife Gill and children Megan 17 Sam 14 and Emily10 No matter how many years passed he always spoke about Gill with the sparkle of a boy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance" target="_blank">dancing</a> with the prettiest girl at the promI used to tease him that he was punching above his weight but of course he wasn't They had each found their match the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Love" target="_blank">love</a> of their livesâI have lost my best friendâ is how Gill describes his passingMegan spoke for all the children when she said âYou are the best <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father"

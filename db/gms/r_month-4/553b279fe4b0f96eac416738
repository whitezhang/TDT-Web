JOHN Swinney cannot guarantee a cutfree <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budget" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budget" target="_blank">budget</a> if <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> were financially independent the Evening Times can revealThe Deputy First Minister refused to rule out cuts under full <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiscal_policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiscal_policy" target="_blank">Fiscal</a> autonomy but added it would &quotimprove <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" target="_blank">economic</a> reforms&quotSpeaking yesterday during a campaigning <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Session" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court_of_Session" target="_blank">session</a> with Glasgow North candidate Patrick Grady Mr Swinney said a timetable for full <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiscal_policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiscal_policy" target="_blank">fiscal</a> autonomy &quotwould be determined by political discussion with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">UK government</a>&quot and added &quotCrucially with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiscal_policy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiscal_policy" target="_blank">fiscal</a> autonomy which is often missed in the debate it gives you the power to improve <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" target="_blank">economic</a> reforms&quot If you look back at pre 1999 before the establishment of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Parliament" target="_blank">Scottish Parliament</a> you have a situation where <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" target="_blank">employment</a> was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" target="_blank">poorer</a> than in the rest of the UK productivity was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" target="_blank">poorer</a> and growth in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" target="_blank">economy</a> was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" target="_blank">poorer</a>&quotIf you look as a consequence of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devolution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Devolution" target="_blank">devolution</a> we've now got a higher employment rate than the rest of the UK productivity which was 6% lower in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> than the rest of the UK is now relatively comparable and growth in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> instead of trailing the UK is now relatively comparable&quotBeing able to take different decisions and distinctive decisions here in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> compared to decisions taken on a one size for all within the UK gives you the ability to take different decisions which are in the right interests of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a>&quotThe finance secretary also blasted the IFS report earlier this week which said the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a>'s rhetoric did not match their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance" target="_blank">financial</a> plans in their manifestoHe said the report has inaccuracies and said &quotI think there were three particular flaws in the IFS analysis  they gave us no <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance" target="_blank">financial</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Credit_%28finance%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Credit_%28finance%29" target="_blank">credit</a> for tackling tax avoidance no credit for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tax" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tax" target="_blank">tax</a> changes or rises we are putting in place and thirdly they put the wrong borrowing figure in for 201920&quotIf they included those three factors you would have had a very different analysis&quotMr Swinney was also unable to guarantee an austerityfree <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budget" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budget" target="_blank">budget</a> in the next <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">parliament</a> but vowed that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_Parliament" target="_blank">MPs</a> would &quotpress for an increase in public expenditure of 05% above <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inflation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inflation" target="_blank">inflation</a> in each of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Finance" target="_blank">financial</a> years of the next <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">parliament</a>&quot&quotThat's the guarantee from the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a>&quothe addedHe said the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a> were &quotdesperate&quot for austerity to be brought to an end adding that they want to see <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Investment" target="_blank">investment</a> in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" target="_blank">economy</a> in line with his party's proposalsSpeaking about his appearance on Question Time earlier this week he slated William Haig's performance and said &quotHe was getting pressed by members of the audience and they were asking where he was going to make these cuts what's going to be the scope&quotThere was no answerhe couldn't say David Dimbleby was asking him 'Do you know and you're not telling us or do you not know'&quot Whatever one it is people can only assume there is going to be some further significant impacts on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_services" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_services" target="_blank">public services</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_finance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_finance" target="_blank">public expenditure</a> and particularly on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a>&quotMost particularly on vulnerable people within <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> because what the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tory" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tory" target="_blank">Tories</a> are trying to do is reduce welfare expenditure and that will have the most severe effect on members of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a> here &quotAn avid runner Mr Swinney said he is in training for the Mull of Kintyre half marathon at the end of next monthWhen asked if he thought he would beat <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour</a>'s Jim Murphy in a race he said &quotI suspect on this one Jim Murphy would have the edge&quotJim Murphy is a faster runner than me I'm pretty sure that is a known fact&quotElectorally though we are in the lead&quot

it seems a groundswell of local opinion that thinks a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_festival" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music_festival" target="_blank">music festival</a> here

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Community" target="_blank">community</a> that is opposed to the festivalWendy Wallace who is also painting and distributing Ts says a few vocal NIMBYs do not represent the majority who live around Strathallan and want the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Festival" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Festival" target="_blank">festival</a> to go ahead thereâSome people just don't want it in their back gardenâ she said âBut they are happy to go to other huge events across the country That's a very selfish attitude to haveâ   <a

festival</a> might be setting up over the wall from his home he was not sure what was involved Aged 35 with four kids he had never been to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/T_in_the_Park" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/T_in_the_Park" target="_blank">T in the Park</a>âI'd always been busy with work and kidsâ he said âI'm not old but my perception of it was a heap of young people going partyingâThen the promoters invited him to last year's event â and it changed his mind He said âYou are not in a good position to judge it if you haven't been My eyes were openedâI thought it wouldn't be my thing but then I realised you can stand back watch the music and see it all You don't have to be right in the crowd I was amazed at the amount of older people there The first ones I saw were in their 60sâI changed my mind as soon as I saw it There was nothing I looked at and thought âI don't like that' Everybody thinks of it as 80000 teenagers out getting drunk but I don't think I would miss it now I would go even if it wasn't just over the back wallâFor Wendy a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/T_in_the_Park"

A FIRE Service boss blasted by a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheriff" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheriff" target="_blank">sheriff</a> over his role in a mum's death has landed a plum promotionLawyer Alison Hume 44 died in agony after being trapped 45ft down a disused mine for almost eight hours in 2008Group <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commander" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commander" target="_blank">commander</a> Paul Stewart's orders stopped <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" target="_blank">firefighters</a> going in to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" target="_blank">rescue</a> her and she had a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myocardial_infarction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myocardial_infarction" target="_blank">heart attack</a> brought on by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypothermia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypothermia" target="_blank">hypothermia</a> six hours after they arrived at the scene in Galston AyrshireStewart 43 â then part of Strathclyde Fire and Rescue â was strongly criticised for his actions and for the standard of his evidence at an inquiry into Alison's deathNow he has been promoted to area manager and will be one of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chief_Petty_Officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chief_Petty_Officer" target="_blank">chief</a> officers at the Scottish <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" target="_blank">Fire and Rescue Service</a>'s &pound46million <a

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" target="_blank">firefighters</a> are livid at the appointmentOne experienced <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Officer_%28armed_forces%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Officer_%28armed_forces%29" target="_blank">officer</a> said âStewart has never really expressed any remorse for his actions â or lack of them â at GalstonâHe won't get any support in his new job from many of the guys I knowâStewart's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promotion_%28rank%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Promotion_%28rank%29" target="_blank">promotion</a> is also likely to enrage Alison's family In June 2013 her stepfather Hugh Cowan hit out after our sister paper the Sunday Mail revealed Stewart was being put in charge of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire_safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fire_safety" target="_blank">fire safety</a> at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commonwealth_of_Nations" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Commonwealth_of_Nations" target="_blank">Commonwealth</a> GamesHe said at the time âI am shocked and appalled that the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" target="_blank">fire service</a> are even considering promoting this man It is an absolute disgrace and the service should be ashamedâMumoftwo Alison fell into the mineshaft on the night of July 26 2008 while taking a short cut to her home nearbyShe was found by her daughter Jayne then 19 â but although <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emergency_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emergency_service" target="_blank">emergency services</a> arrived at 215am she was only freed at 742am when <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_rescue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain_rescue" target="_blank">mountain rescue</a> experts arrivedShe suffered a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myocardial_infarction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myocardial_infarction" target="_blank">heart attack</a> while being brought to the surface and died Earlier Stewart had stopped a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paramedic" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paramedic" target="_blank">paramedic</a> being lowered down on ropes to tend to Alison who had a collapsed lung several broken ribs and a broken sternum but was still consciousThen he forbade any attempt by his colleagues to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" target="_blank">rescue</a> her using the ropesThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accident" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accident" target="_blank">fatal accident</a> inquiry at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard that at one point <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" target="_blank">firefighters</a> put their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safety" target="_blank">safety</a> harnesses on and were about to enter the shaft but were ordered to stand down by StewartSheriff Desmond J Leslie slammed Stewart for giving âbullish if not arrogantâ evidence to the inquiryHe said âMr Stewart considered the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" target="_blank">rescue operation</a> was a successâUnfortunately this was not a successful operationMrs Hume's injuries were survivable â <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypothermia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypothermia" target="_blank">hypothermia</a> materially diminished her chances of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Survival_skills" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Survival_skills" target="_blank">survival</a>âThe gradual onset of that condition was not recognised as a potential problemâThere is little doubt the rankandfile <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Firefighter" target="_blank">firefighters</a> in attendance were anxious to conduct a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue" target="_blank">rescue</a> as quickly as possible but were prevented from doing so by their superiorsâ

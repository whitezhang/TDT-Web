SIR Alex Ferguson has said he is finding retirement &quotmore exhausting&quot than <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Management" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Management" target="_blank">managing</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester" target="_blank">Manchester</a> UnitedThe <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" target="_blank">English</a> clubHe has since got involved in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charitable_trust"

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" target="_blank">Govan</a> heroine Mary Barbour who successfully led <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" target="_blank">rent</a> strikes during the First World WarHe was asked about the variety of work he is doing and said &quotI'm making sure that I'm active that's important when you retire and I've got many things on my plate&quotIt's funny because it's a different type of work where as at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_Kingdom" target="_blank">United</a> I would be in every morning at quarter to seven and be there to tea time it's the one constant thing in your life&quotNow it's different things so that's probably more exhausting&quotI don't get up at six in the morning any more that's for sure I have a long lie now and again&quotFerguson wrote a cheque for the Remember Mary Barbour Fund in memory of the &quotformidable firebrand&quot from GovanMs Barbour led <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" target="_blank">rent</a> strikes in the city in 1915 forcing a change in the <a

target="_blank">today</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Ferguson" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Ferguson" target="_blank">Sir Alex</a> said &quotIt was only when I got into my adult years that I learned about her&quotI never got told about it at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> it was by looking at Harry Benson's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Book" target="_blank">book</a> of photographs of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> that's where I learned about Mary Barbour&quotObviously the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" target="_blank">Govan</a> connection stirred a real interest and for me that great photograph of all the housewives in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" target="_blank">Govan</a> standing outside the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norwich" target="_blank">close</a>  that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" target="_blank">rent</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_United_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Manchester_United_F.C." target="_blank">man</a> was never getting in  that registers deeply with me I've looked at that photograph many many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a>&quotThat was the start of my interest in this and I think it's a great cause too&quotA housewife's role at that time was to look after the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords" target="_blank">house</a> make sure the kids got to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> and that there was food on the table and that image shows the strength of the women that they were not prepared to take any more from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rent_%28musical%29" target="_blank">rent</a> men at that particular <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">time</a>&quotIt was a courageous move and Mary Barbour went on to do many great things after that and she's well remembered for it&quotSir <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Ferguson" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Ferguson" target="_blank">Alex</a> takes pride in where he grew up and hopes the campaign and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statue" target="_blank">statue</a> can lead to more <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> learning about Ms Barbour's storyHe said &quotYour upbringing is important I think it's the foundation of your life&quotI was fortunate that I had good parents who did the best they could possibly do for me&quotMany <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> have said I came from a poor background but I don't think that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> who grew up in my time thought they were poor&quotYou were <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" target="_blank">taught</a> to be the best you can be by not just parents but by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" target="_blank">teachers</a> you had at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a>&quotEducation is not just about going to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> it's about inspiring you and I was inspired by many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29"

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London" target="_blank">City</a> ChambersMs Fyfe said &quotA rough estimate is we need between &pound80000

materials they want to use&quotAt the moment we're touching about &pound40000 including promises as well as actual cash&quotI just want to say <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Govan" target="_blank">Govan</a> we consulted <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> around the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_of_London" target="_blank">city</a> and thought about George Square

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celebrity" target="_blank">celebrity</a> turnout might not be quite so highThe Cumbernauld artist said âThis is the most rarified cuttingedge <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" target="_blank">art</a> environmentâI want to take this exhibition to Los Angeles Chicago and Boston âThen let's take the paintings to Easterhouse shopping centre I won't put a single piece of text on it not a single explanation and just watch the impact it has on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a>âIt doesn't matter who they are or where they're from When <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> see these paintings they connect with themâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">People</a> don't need to have had an education in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" target="_blank">art</a> or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music" target="_blank">music</a> on order to appreciate itâGraham spent seven months working on the paintings jetting between the US and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" target="_blank">Scotland</a> to photograph then paint his sittersHe put thousands of hours into producing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait" target="_blank">portraits</a> that include Elaine C Smith in panto Breaking Bad <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celebrity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celebrity" target="_blank">star</a> Laura Fraser and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a>'s Hollywood theme tune composer Craig ArmstrongGraham said âI'm fascinated by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> and I get the opportunity to delve a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bit" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bit" target="_blank">bit</a> deeper when I'm painting themâEverybody has something that makes then remarkable But when <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> ask me to describe what it feels like to paint I tell them it's like eating or walking It's just what I doâGerard who says what he does is âjust complicated colouring inâ also produced a collection of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Portrait" target="_blank">portraits</a> for last year's Commonwealth Games <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Culture" target="_blank">culture</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Festival" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Festival" target="_blank">festival</a> It included former Celtic boss Neil Lennon actress Karen Dunbar singersongwriter Ricky Ross and tennis mum Judy MurrayBut he feels there's one in his latest batch which could be a defining moment of his career â and a defining image of his subject He said âI think I made a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bit" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bit" target="_blank">bit</a> of a classic with Nicola Sturgeon We did it at Bute House and I think she was nervousâWe couldn't get the pose right In a situation like that the First Minister is trusting me with her likeness to treat her with respect and sensitivityâI actually felt quite protective towards her She's a tough cookie but there's something intensely personal about agreeing to something like this I turned away at one point to fix my lights and when I turned back she was standing like thatâIt went from being a disaster to being in the bag It says something about her confidence youth and femininityâHe also felt protective of Billy Connolly because of his struggle with Parkinson's disease Gerard said âI wanted to put my arms around himâThe shoot was challenging because of the âmask' which comes over <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> with the disease I asked him what he wanted and he said he wanted it to feature shipbuilding It was absolutely perfectâThe banjo is in there although he can't play it any more But he isn't daunted by it He and his wife Pamela were up <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dance" target="_blank">dancing</a> at the auction and they were looking greatâThe proceeds from the sale â with the exception of the Connolly piece â go to the Prince &amp Princess of Wales Hospice's Brick by Brick appeal to build a new facility in GlasgowGerard walked in the Tartan Day <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parade" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parade" target="_blank">Parade</a> on Saturday with his family Such Americanised pomp might make some feel uncomfortable to be celebrated merely for their birthrightBut Gerard paints the truest picture in response He said âRather than being focused on our success we are driven often by our fear of failureâThere's that feeling of âWow we got away with it' That wee boy we used to be is still in thereâTry our quick showbiz quiz below

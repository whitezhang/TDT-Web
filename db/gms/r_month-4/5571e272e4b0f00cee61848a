A NEW &pound15million fleet of buses on the Isle of Arran has driven tourism bosses round the bendThe ecofriendly arrivals have been branded a waste of cash â because they have no space for visitors' luggageThe buses boast hybrid engines and were meant to make the island fully accessible for the first timeBut the vehicles introduced over the past few weeks have been slated by tourism chiefs as unfit for purpose and unsuitable for the holiday isleIslanders say the vehicles have struggled to negotiate hilly terrain when full of passengersMechanics have already been forced to make changes to the fleet's gearboxes in a bid to solve the problemStrathclyde Partnership for Transport bought a dozen new buses to upgrade <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy" target="_blank">services</a> on the islandThe fleet is comprised of eight Wrightbus Streetlites which use hybrid technology and four smaller Optare SolosOne islander said âThey're the talk of the place There's no space for bags or suitcases â which is not much use on a holiday hotspotâThey have these new engines which are designed to save the environment but the impression is they are a bit underpowered when the buses are busyâThere was one time when it was struggling to get up the hill out of Kildonan and the driver didn't think they would make itâSPT who have leased the buses to Stagecoach Western admitted gearboxes were âreprogrammedâ to take account of the island's hilly terrainVisit Arran executive director Sheila Gilmore said âWe welcome the investment by SPT and these are beautiful shiny new buses but they aren't fit for purposeâThere's nowhere to put luggage They are urban buses â they're not designed for a Scottish tourist islandâArran's just been ranked No1 Scottish island on TripAdvisor That highlights how important visitors are for usâWe're extremely disappointed that thought wasn't given to the carriage for luggage or space for bikes on these buses âWe're trying to encourage <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> to use public transport on Arran but it's very difficult to tell <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> to bring their golf clubs if there is nowhere to put them on the bus There aren't even any overhead luggage racks All the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> coming off the bus who are staying north of Brodick are probably carrying luggageâI am at a loss why SPT thought a bus with no luggage space would be the answerâShe added âYou invariably find the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> who use public transport aren't the ones consulted on what's needed The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> in SPT have probably never been in Arran on a bus A bit of consultation would have been greatâ  Sheila said the tourist group had been in touch with SPT about the matterAn SPT spokeswoman said âWe've received very positive feedback from Stagecoach regarding the vehicles SPT funded for use on ArranâThese vehicles have conventional diesel engines along with additional equipment fitted to reduce fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in order to improve air quality and be certified as lowcarbon vehiclesâFollowing some feedback from the drivers we understand the gearboxes were reprogrammed to take account of the terrain on Arran but we are not aware of any impact on passengersâWe've placed an order for additional luggage racking which will be fitted over the coming weeksâA Stagecoach spokeswoman said âWe've received very positive feedback about the new fleet of vehicles from passengers which are providing accessibility to more <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> to travel around ArranâThe gearboxes were adjusted to take into account some steep hills on the island At no point have any buses been unable to climb hillsâ

Jailed sex offenders are staying up &quotall night&quot watching <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" target="_blank">porn</a> despite prison staff regularly changing TV codes a former con revealedIt is understood that inmates have been able to gain access to latenight adult channels like Television X by deciphering PIN number blocksThe ongoing practice has been branded &quotmore than disappointing&quot by Tory justice spokesperson Margaret Mitchell who has called on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government" target="_blank">Scottish Government</a> to take actionIt comes after a former prisoner at HM Prison Glenochil revealed that prison staff &quotgave up&quot changing codes when the issue first came to light in 2013The male source who spent two years at the jail said &quotThey're up all night watching <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" target="_blank">porn</a> on Freeview&quotThe reason they're getting away with it is because there is not enough checks on the prisoners by staff members&quotLast time this was in the paper they tried to change codes but it didn't work so the staff don't bother&quotTo be honest it's totally wrong and these are the people that are a danger to women men and children&quotBeing able to watch this stuff in their cell TV makes them more of a risk to the public&quotI am a former prisoner of that jail It is the worst prison in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> since Peterhead shut down as all that happens is people getting groomed by them predators&quotI have been in that jail for two years there has been so much that has went on that people should know about It's just a very wrong and bad jail to be in&quotHMP Glenochil's current design capacity is 670 and the prison holds on average a daily population of 660It manages adult male offenders who are short term offenders long term offenders life sentence offenders and extended sentence offendersIt is also one of the major sites in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> for managing sex offenders and those with an Order of Lifelong RestrictionThe former prisoner revealed inmates have been able to get access to Freeview in their cells by creating aerials from bits of copper wireThey then access premium channels with paidfor codes supplied by family and friendsHe said staff tried to change the code for the televisions by linking them to computers and deleting the default codes to make new onesBut by the time the staff had changed the codes prisoners on the first and second floors had been given the new code by a member of the prison staffHe said &quotHow they manage to make the aerials for the TVs is they steal a bit of copper wire for the recycling and hide it in their plastic ID card at the back&quotThey put a false back on it so it looks like it's just a normal card&quotThey can avoid the metal detector as they got to put their keys and cards down as their keys are usually attached to their cards and walk through it then pick them up&quotThat's how they get the copper up to halls and then the guy that has the copper wire sells it to other cons for #4 or a half of tobacco&quotThat Freeview should be stopped in jail because they are up all night watching TV X and all <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" target="_blank">free porn</a> channels&quotScottish Conservative justice spokesperson Margaret Mitchell <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" target="_blank">MSP</a> branded the situation &quotmore than disappointing&quotShe said &quotWe need to make sure that what they are watching on television is monitored&quotIf they are sending this via text how exactly are these prisoners getting access to mobile phones&quotCertainly blocking signals would be a big first step in stopping the illegal use of mobile phones&quotI think the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government" target="_blank">Scottish Government</a> has been dragging its feet a little&quotIt's more than disappointing It is not something new that has happened&quotIt's quite simple it is a privilege and you must monitor who gets that privilege&quotIn 2013 the same story broke and I and the public would fully expect that the prison authorities and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Government" target="_blank">Scottish Government</a> would take steps to ensure this doesn't happen again&quotA Scottish Prison Service spokeswoman said &quotWhilst we have no evidence of this happening we are grateful to you for bringing this to our attention and we will investigate this thoroughly&quotIn relation to offenders accessing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" target="_blank">pornography</a> as part of their treatment the spokeswoman added &quotOffenders may participate in a Healthy Sexual Functioning module but the use of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pornography" target="_blank">pornography</a> is not part of the treatment strategy&quotTry your hand at our news quiz

was foundThe 34yearold woman who did not know where Emma's remains were discovered took <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> to the isolated road surrounded by dense woods in February 2006 but became distressed as they approached the locationShe had identified Packer from photographs and told <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> he was one of her clientsShe agreed to show <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" target="_blank">detectives</a> the remote spot where he took her after picking her up in GlasgowThe Sunday

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> of Packer some of whom were also <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" target="_blank">interviewed</a> by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" target="_blank">detectives</a> investigating Emma's murder One said âThe girl said they had been on the M74 for ages and they initially missed the turnoffâThey got back on the right road but she became upset as they got closer and she started remembering the placeâShe was crying and shaking when she saw the pine trees but eventually asked them to stop next to a silver gateâShe didn't know but they were almost exactly opposite the place Emma's body was foundâShe went down there a few <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> with him That seemed to be his thing Maybe the drive was part of the thrillâHe took Emma there and took a number of other girls there tooâAnother <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">prostitute</a> told <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" target="_blank">detectives</a> that she thought Packer was besotted with Emma to the extent that he would try to scare off other clientsA source said âShe basically said that for a time this guy was always looking for Emma as if none of the other girls interested himâShe told officers that he had no respect for the women he picked up and treated them with disdainâ Twicemarried Packer has also had a number of longterm partnersHis first wife told <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> he would ask her to go for a drive then cruise around <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a>'s redlight districtThey had an occasionally stormy relationship but she did not believe the warnings from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Friends" target="_blank">friends</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> that he was using prostitutesA friend of the woman said âShe says she is still traumatised by their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" target="_blank">marriage</a> to this dayâShe was questioned by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" target="_blank">detectives</a> about Iain and Emma Caldwell as were members of her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> but says the last thing she wants to do is talk about himâPacker's second wife left him after she caught him with a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">prostitute</a> in their home after arriving back early from a night outThe woman declined to speak publicly about Packer but a friend said âShe wants nothing to do with himâ Another friend Elayne McAllister said she and her husband <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Police_Service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Police_Service" target="_blank">met</a> Packer and his wife when they lived near each other in East KilbrideShe said âTwo <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Detective" target="_blank">detectives</a> came round to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" target="_blank">interview</a> us about Emma Caldwell because Iain had been using my husband's identity in sex clubs and saunas and with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">hookers</a>âI remember them saying to us to keep watching the news They thought we would be seeing him on itâ Until recently Packer lived in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> home in the east end of GlasgowHe declined to respond to messages left for him there by the Sunday MailHis dad Murray said âHe doesn't want to speak to you That's it finishedâHe has already been cleared by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> He's got a new life he's away from here and he does not want to speak to anybody about thisâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">Police</a> We turn over every stone to find killerOn the day after Emma's body was found in May 2005 the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Officer_%28armed_forces%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Officer_%28armed_forces%29" target="_blank">officer</a> leading the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criminal_Investigation_Department"

âInquiries into Emma's death are at a very early stage although the incident room has been running since April 19following her disappearanceâWe will be turning over every stone that we find to try to find the killer or killers of EmmaâForensic officers are carrying out a detailed search of the area and a team of officers has been dedicated to this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criminal_Investigation_Department" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criminal_Investigation_Department" target="_blank">investigation</a>âWe can say that she was addicted The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> are aware of that and despite their best efforts they could not draw her away from the power of that addictionâI have spent some time speaking to the parents of Emma who are naturally devastated at their lossâToday is also the seventh anniversary of her sister Karen's death which makes it particularly difficult to bearâEvery step in what was to become one of the longestrunning most complex murder investigations in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" target="_blank">Scotland</a> should have been logged and directed by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Home_Office" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Home_Office" target="_blank">Home Office</a> Large Major Enquiry SystemHOLMES staffed by trained and experienced

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criminal_Investigation_Department" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Criminal_Investigation_Department" target="_blank">investigation</a> before being apprehended by a beat <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Officer_%28armed_forces%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Officer_%28armed_forces%29" target="_blank">officer</a> who stopped him by chanceThe first task of the HOLMES staff was to input upload and review all the inquiries carried out while Emma had beencategorised missingTheir base was Aikenhead Road <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_station" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_station" target="_blank">police station</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> near the hostel where Emma had livedReinforcements were also requested early on with officers from the then Serious Crime Squad and local divisions seconded to the inquiry some for weeks or months and others for yearsAt its height more than 100 officers and support staff worked on the investigationPolice <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" target="_blank">Scotland</a> We haven't given up the hunt <a

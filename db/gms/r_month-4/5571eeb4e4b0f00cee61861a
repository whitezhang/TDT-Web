THE couple hoping to play host to this year's T in the Park last night urged protesters and councillors not to silence <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland's</a> biggest music festivalThe Roberts family have owned Strathallan <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castle" target="_blank">Castle</a> for more than a century and Jamie and Debs Roberts are on tenterhooks over an application with their local council to relocate the event to the estateThey claim a negative <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">decision</a> would lead to nearby Auchterarder being dubbed âthe town that said NO to T in the ParkâDebs said âThere are <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> who say to us in the street âDon't worry about it' but of course we do worryâIt's a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning_permission" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning_permission" target="_blank">planning application</a> that could be successful or it could failâA supporter stopped me in the street saying one of their concerns is that if the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning_permission" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning_permission" target="_blank">planning application</a> doesn't go through the town of Auchterarder would be seen as the town that says âNo' to things That would do real damageâI would be really worried that it would earn a reputation around the world as the town that said âNo' to T in the Park because it would damage the reputation of Auchterarder and Perthshire going forwardâSitting in the chilly drawing room of Strathallan <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castle" target="_blank">Castle</a> Jamie and Debs both 43 also revealed they were first approached in secret four years ago by organisers DF Concerts about hosting T in the Park Jamie said âAs a family we're always looking for new and diverse income streams of revenueâWe would be na&iumlve not to listen to any option that came alongâWe spent a long time in dialogue with DF Concerts and we were very happy with what they could offerâThe organisers of the 85000 capacity music festival which was founded in 1994 have been forced to move from Balado near Kinross because of health and safety concerns over a gas pipelineInitially T in the Park bosses believed their application to stage the event at Strathallan from July 1012 this year would be straightforwardThat all changed with the discovery of an osprey nest in September 2014 leading to two public consultations as part of a wider application process including an environmental impact statementDebs and Jamie admit there is a real danger that a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning_permission" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning_permission" target="_blank">planning application</a> to have T in the Park take place on their land will be rejected not least due to the highly organised Strathallan T Action Group â or STAG for short â who are opposed to the moveA <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">decision</a> by Perth and Kinross Council is due next month and the fate of the festival featuring acts like Noel Gallagher and Kasabian hangs in the balance after DF Concerts submitted an updated <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Planning" target="_blank">planning</a> applicationIt included new information about traffic <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plan" target="_blank">plans</a> and further investigations into local wildlifeThe waters have been muddied by accusations that DF Concerts have positioned a digger and crane adorned with a Saltire and CDs to discourage ospreys returning after the winter for nesting STAG supporters have voiced concerns that laws protecting wildlife may be âgot roundâJamie said âYou don't get round them You obey Those laws are there for a very good reasonâDebs added âWhat we have to remember is that the estate is not just the bit that is being used for T in the ParkâThere is wildlife all over and we are <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> who are wildlife friendlyâWe have been organic farmers for over 20 yearsâWe understand what it's like to manage the wildlife when you are actively having human intervention such as agriculture on siteâWhere we farm organically we have seen the brown hare <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Population" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Population" target="_blank">population</a> quadruple in that timeâThat's valuable to us So we are very secure that the advice that is being given â and DF Concerts are following â in protecting the wildlife on site is exactly as it should beâThere are no laws being brokenâIt's following their advice and working with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> to make sure that things are being protectedâThere's also a potential &pound24million annual windfall for the local economy if T in the Park does go ahead in JulyJamie said âAs you can see you are sitting in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Castle" target="_blank">castle</a>âIt's not cheap to maintain a house let alone run itâIt can't be done from the returns from agriculture alone which is primarily the income streams on the estateâT in the Park would allow upgrades and renovations to be done The local B&ampBs have been full since last June when it was announced that T in the Park may be coming hereâI spoke last night to a man who runs a local bus service who can't wait For petrol stations and local shops the benefits are obviousâ While the locals appear split on the pros and cons even family members have come out against the move to stage T in the Park including Mark LiddiardA cousin of Jamie and Jamie's sister Anna Liddiard's property will be surrounded by the festival campsiteHe said recently âMy wife and I have bent over backwards to help Anna with business ideas We thought she was our friend until she came up with another business idea â T in the ParkâThe first I heard was from the guy in his tractor outside my fence saying he wasn't planting beans as this was to be the campsiteâAsked about the strain on family relations Jamie and Debs stand firmJamie said âBringing 85000 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> to a rural environment in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> is out of the box thinkingâThere will always be <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> who are unhappy with any <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">decision</a>âAnd what of the claims by STAG that councillors may have already made up their mindsJamie said âIf the application is successful it will happen on Strathallan If it doesn't it won'tâIf it doesn't happen I'll be very disappointed but we have to abide by due processâTry your hand at our daily entertainment quiz

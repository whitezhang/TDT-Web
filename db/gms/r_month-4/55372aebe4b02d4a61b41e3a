AS his success soars jewellery designer Euan McWhirter will always be grateful to some gorgeous Lucky BitchesLucky Bitches â the stunning rings which made a name for the Scots <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Designer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Designer" target="_blank">designer</a> â have adorned the rich and famous and are now a musthave for fashionistasTheir cheeky name was a nod to a French and Saunders spoof of Jackie and Joan CollinsAs the blurb goes they are âA swirling ball of handcut <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasses" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasses" target="_blank">glass</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disc_jockey" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disc_jockey" target="_blank">spinning</a> on a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swarovski" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swarovski" target="_blank">Swarovski</a> encrusted shank Bold fun and glamorous what more could a girl ask for in a ringâAs well as making it to the pages of top glossies they have become a favourite among some big names <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kylie_Minogue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kylie_Minogue" target="_blank">Kylie Minogue</a> wore one on a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magazine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magazine" target="_blank">magazine</a> shoot to celebrate 25 years in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> Laura Bailey chose it for a series of pictures and Shirley Manson sported a Lucky Bitch for an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">interview</a> on the Chelsea Lately show Euan 35 said âThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Design" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Design" target="_blank">design</a> has helped to make my name and I couldn't believe it when the email came through asking if I could supply one for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kylie_Minogue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kylie_Minogue" target="_blank">Kylie</a>âThen Laura Bailey and Shirley Manson It was really exciting and a real boost for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a>âI have always loved Shirley Manson I grew up listening to Garbage She's Scottish and very coolâ In his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> workshop he produces exquisite pieces â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femininity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femininity" target="_blank">feminine</a> with a touch of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Punk_fashion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Punk_fashion" target="_blank">punk</a>â His pearl spike collar epitomises his style â <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femininity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femininity" target="_blank">feminine</a> with a feisty edge His work is special but for the most part affordable and few reach the price bracket of his supersized giant chandelier earrings which cost just over &pound1000As a child growing up in Troon Ayrshire Euan knew that he wanted to work in a creative <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> He used to make body armour from whatever materials were kicking about and his fascination with product <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Construction" target="_blank">construction</a> was shown in the many toys and electronics he took apart and put together again His mum and lorry driver dad were supportive but worried that he should get a âproper <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" target="_blank">job</a>â if he was going to make a livingEuan said âI think growing up in the west coast my dad would have had more confidence in me doing something manual or labour intensive I think he thought that making <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewellery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewellery" target="_blank">jewellery</a> was messing aboutâBut they are happy now they see what a success Euan has made He said âThey were supportive and never tried to stop me They were just concerned and I can understand thatâAs a child he had a low boredom threshold and found escape in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" target="_blank">art</a> and sketching <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clothing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clothing" target="_blank">clothes</a> inspired by afternoons in front of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clothing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clothing" target="_blank">Clothes</a> ShowEuan said âI think the 80s were inspiring â about being bold with colour and expressing yourself I always loved <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fashion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fashion" target="_blank">fashion</a> as a way to express myselfâAfter school he studied <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Design" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Design" target="_blank">design</a> at Ayr College and was then accepted by the prestigious <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Saint_Martins_College_of_Art_and_Design" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_Saint_Martins_College_of_Art_and_Design" target="_blank">Central Saint Martins</a> University in London â a worldleading centre for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graphic_design" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graphic_design" target="_blank">art and design</a> educationHe was only 19 and it was a huge leap to find himself transported to the whirl of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> He said âIt was a shockâI was still growing up and I had to find my way I studied hard but I could also be a bit of a tearaway I went out a lot I did learn an enormous amount and it was an incredible start for meâAfter graduating he returned home to work for various <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewellery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jewellery" target="_blank">jewellers</a> before he felt compelled to return to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> He was hired by

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" target="_blank">job</a> That was that catalyst he needed to make it on his ownHe returned home regrouped and started working towards his own brand Euan said âI was upset to lose my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" target="_blank">job</a> but it did give the kick I needed to start up on my ownâHe was chosen by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fashion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fashion" target="_blank">fashion</a> legend and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journalist" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Journalist" target="_blank">journalist</a> Hilary Alexander to be one of the <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/American_Dream" target="_blank">dream</a> of setting up his label and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">firm</a> has blossomedHe recently travelled to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/India" target="_blank">India</a> with Scottish Development

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brand" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brand" target="_blank">brand</a> goes from strength to strength he is confident but grounded and he is grateful to wake up looking forward to coming up with new creationsEuan said âI do appreciate that every day I get to do something I love and still be selfsufficient It has taken a while to get established but I'm happy with what I have achieved so farâI think being from Scotland we can be down on ourselves but it is important to recognise that we can achieve a lot and it doesn't matter where you start outâ

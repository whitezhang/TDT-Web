GRAINY footage of a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Performance_art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Performance_art" target="_blank">performance</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> by Allen Ginsberg one of the leading figures of the Beat Generation is the perfect image to portray the birth of the city's flourishing arts sceneThe year is 1973 and incredibly someone had got hold of a film camera to record the occasion in the former premises of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> Society of Lady <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artist" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artist" target="_blank">Artists</a>' Club in Blythswood SquareAs the American countercultural thinker who was vehemently opposed to militarism and economic materialism recited <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry" target="_blank">poetry</a> to a rapt audience and sang folk songs a young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glaswegian</a> man sat by his side accompanying the songs on guitar&quotSomebody phoned me and asked me to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> at the gig it might have been Tom McGrath and I said sure because I had been impressed when I was a teenager by Jack Kerouac and the Beat Generation&quot remembers Allan Tall the 66yearold actor and musician who played with Ginsberg and went on to appear on stage and screen in Braveheart Hamish Macbeth Monarch of the Glen The Cherry Orchard and Midsummer Night's Dream&quotI was happy to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> in front of folk I can't remember if I was paid I think in those days you got paid more than you do now as there weren't open mike nights&quotGinsberg was knackered he'd been travelling quite a bit We didn't have any rehearsal we just sat there and tried to feel the vibe as they say&quotThe radical <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poet" target="_blank">poet</a> playwright and musician Tom McGrath had set up a makeshift arts base in Blythswood Square for likeminded people to come togetherHis idea blossomed with the opening two years later of the legendary Third Eye Centre on Sauchiehall Street now better known as the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_Centre_for_Architecture" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_Centre_for_Architecture" target="_blank">CCA</a> which celebrates its 40th anniversary on May 1It was officially opened when then Lord Provost Sir William Gray who later became chairman of the organisation was at the head of a parade on Sauchiehall Street to mark the 800th anniversary of the granting of the Royal Charter to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">City of Glasgow</a> and brought the procession to a halt to cut the ribbon at the front doorOver the years the venue was not only a place to meet eat drink and attend events it brought the best <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modern_art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Modern_art" target="_blank">modern art</a> into the lives of people in the city and was a crucial link in what is now referred to as the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> Miracle and the city's global status as a breeding ground for prizewinning artistsA regular at the Third Eye Centre Allan who still lives in the West End of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" target="_blank">met</a> Tom in the 1960s and worked with him on a number of occasions over the years&quotTom had become more actively interested in Eastern religion particularly through his involvement with the late Sri Chinmoy who was also a kind of guru to John McLaughlin the guitar player and Carlos Santana&quot he explains&quotAlan Spence the writer got involved too I think that had a lot to do with calling it the Third Eye Centre&quotIt was a good move on Tom's part to move the venue to Sauchiehall Street  then it really took off&quotThe old cafe which had a very low ceiling was very atmospheric and that was where everybody <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art" target="_blank">met</a> There is video footage of gigs there&quotThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Painting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Painting" target="_blank">painter</a> Alan Davie came along one day I think there was an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Movie_theater" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Movie_theater" target="_blank">exhibition</a> of his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Painting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Painting" target="_blank">paintings</a> and that evening he had a gig with his jazz band and played soprano sax&quotAllan remembers the launch of writer and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artist" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artist" target="_blank">artist</a> Alasdair's Gray's legendary work of fiction Lanark there and an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Movie_theater" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Movie_theater" target="_blank">exhibition</a> of the work of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Painting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Painting" target="_blank">painter</a> John Byrne&quotWhen the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_Centre_for_Architecture" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_Centre_for_Architecture" target="_blank">CCA</a> opened in 1992 I didn't like it I came in and thought 'They've lost all the character' But a couple of months later I was loving it it was nice to have all the light in I think it's a great place now&quot says Allan&quotIn the old days it felt pokier more East Berlin or <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amsterdam" target="_blank">Amsterdam</a> brown cafe there could be all sorts of skulduggery happening&quotAllan has been just one of those who has helped <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_Centre_for_Architecture" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canadian_Centre_for_Architecture" target="_blank">CCA</a> director <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France" target="_blank">Francis</a> McKee on his trawl through the 40 years' of archive material to identify events and facesAs well as the Allen Ginsberg event among the nuggets uncovered so far are rare footage from the 1970s of young black American minimalist composer Julius Eastman a recording on Ivor Cutler's Life in a Scotch Sitting Room and footage of South African antiapartheid musician Lewis Mahalo&quotWhen the Third Eye was here in the 1970s there was nothing like that in the city They were all really young and started working  40 years later and noone has archived it or can remember what they did&quot says <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France" target="_blank">Francis</a>&quotAnd nobody is here who did it originally It's going back and trying to make sense of that and then using it to help us That has reconnected us to that early spirit of the Third Eye and that has been helpful in regenerating the building&quotLooking at the way they approached <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Art" target="_blank">art</a> and an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arts_centre" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arts_centre" target="_blank">arts centre</a> there aren't many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arts_centre" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arts_centre" target="_blank">arts centres</a> really in the world They came out of hippydom the Third Eye certainly did a sort of psychaedelic squat where you do everything in one room and suddenly all these arts are mixed together&quotNow a lot of intern students are working on the archive and they can do projects and that gets us constantly talking about the organisation and reminds us to keep that as a goal and not to forget why you're here&quotFrancis and his team are keen to hear from anyone who was an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artist" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artist" target="_blank">artist</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Performing_arts" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Performing_arts" target="_blank">performer</a> or even audience member in the early years who can share their memories&quotWhen we started the archive we didn't realise we had inherited a whole new building the villa which used to be the Cotton Club in the 1980s but in the 1960s was also where a lot of blues bands played like Mississippi Fred McDowell and Jack Bruce&quot says <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Francis_I_of_France" target="_blank">Francis</a>&quot We know nothing about that and there's no archive we don't even know what it was called The whole building has its own <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/History" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/History" target="_blank">history</a> and we don't have any of it So if anyone has any of that or can tell us about going there we'd really love to know about that too&quotVisit wwwccaglasgowcom

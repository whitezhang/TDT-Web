for a second night fearful of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aftershock" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aftershock" target="_blank">aftershocks</a> that have not ceased Camped in parks open squares and a golf course they cuddled children or pets against chilly Himalayan nighttime temperaturesThey woke to the sound of dogs yelping and jackhammers As the dawn light crawled across toppled building sites volunteers and rescue workers carefully shifted broken <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concrete" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Concrete" target="_blank">concrete</a> slabs and crumbled bricks mixed together with humble household items pots and pans a purple notebook decorated with butterflies a framed poster of a bodybuilder so many shoes&quotIt's overwhelming It's too much to think about&quot said 55yearold Bijay Nakarmi mourning his parents whose bodies recovered from the rubble of what once was a threestorey buildingHe could tell how they <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> from their injuries His mother was electrocuted by a live wire on the roof top and his father was struck by falling beams on the staircaseHe had last seen them a few days earlier  on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepal" target="_blank">Nepal</a>'s Mother's Day  for a cheerful family meal&quotI have their bodies by the river They are resting until relatives can come to the funeral&quot Mr Nakarmi said as workers

target="_blank">aftershocks</a> were leaving everyone jittery The largest yesterday was magnitude 67&quotThere have been nearly 100 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquakes</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aftershock" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aftershock" target="_blank">aftershocks</a> which is making rescue work difficult Even the rescuers are scared and running because of them&quot he said&quotWe don't feel safe at all There have been so many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aftershock" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aftershock" target="_blank">aftershocks</a> It doesn't stop&quot said Rajendra Dhungana 34 who spent yesterday with his

how few modern structures collapsed in the quakeThis morning some pharmacies and shops for basic provisions opened while bakeries began offering fresh bread With power lines down patchy phone connections and almost no Internet connectivity residents were particularly anxious to buy morning newspapersHuge queues of people desperate to secure fuel lined up outside petrol pumps  prices were the same as they were before the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> struck&quotWe are not raising

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mountain" target="_blank">mountains</a> make Lamjung difficult to reach Even before the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" target="_blank">quake</a> it could take six hours to drive from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu"

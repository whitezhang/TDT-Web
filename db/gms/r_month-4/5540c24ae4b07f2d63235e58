target="_blank">Conservative party</a> ahead of next week's general electionMone from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> revealed she would vote <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Conservative</a> on May 7 in a column for The SunThe lifelong <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour</a> supporter said that the prospect of a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP Government</a> should scare the living daylights out of voters and claimed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_Miliband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_Miliband" target="_blank">Ed Miliband</a> would be bullied by Nicola Sturgeon if he was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">Prime</a> MinisterShe said &quotI am genuinely concerned that we could end up sleepwalking to this outcome <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_Miliband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ed_Miliband" target="_blank">Ed Miliband</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/10_Downing_Street" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/10_Downing_Street" target="_blank">Downing Street</a> being bullied about by Nicola Sturgeon&quotEd <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Miliband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Miliband" target="_blank">Miliband</a> is a nice guy but I just don't think he's real leadership material And frankly Nicola Sturgeon would run rings around him&quotEveryone thinking of voting in this election needs to realise that Nicola Surgeon would totally rule the roost Along with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Salmond" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Salmond" target="_blank">Alex Salmond</a> she would call all the shots&quotWhy does that matter Because together <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour</a> and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> would be a horror show for our <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" target="_blank">economy</a> Their sums just don't add up&quotNo doubt the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> will attack me They say that if you don't vote for them you're not passionate about <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> Pure rubbish I've got the Clyde running through my veins I am so proud to be Scottish proud to be <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_people" target="_blank">British</a>  and proud of how far we've all come together over the past five years&quotMone who founded Ultimo said she was backing the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Conservatives</a> because they were what was best for business in the UK and praised <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a>'s <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">Government</a>'s work on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Economy" target="_blank">economy</a> following the recessionShe said &quotBritain is heading in the right direction with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a> as PM  and frankly the idea of a LabourSNP <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government" target="_blank">government</a> should scare the living daylights out of all of us&quotI remember what it was like in 2008 when the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Early_1990s_recession" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Early_1990s_recession" target="_blank">recession</a> hit People were genuinely scared We had retailers cancelling orders at the lastminute a sense of doom and gloom everywhere&quotBut these days the retailers I meet have smiles on their faces again The high street's buzzing People have more money to buy that car or treat the kids&quotAnd none of this just happened by magic You've got to give credit where it's due to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a>&quotSpeaking to Sky News she added &quotEd <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Miliband" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Miliband" target="_blank">Miliband</a> is a good leader but <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a> is a PM and he's been the best <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" target="_blank">Prime Minister</a> since I've been born that we've ever had&quotI think the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conservative_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Conservatives</a> are good for the UK and for business&quotMone's comments came after a TNS poll predicted a landslide victory for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party"

 TO watch Ronnie Browne sing Flower of Scotland in front of a home crowd at Hampden or Murrayfield is to see a natural performer Or so you would think With his silvery hair and splendid <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kilt" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kilt" target="_blank">kilt</a> he leads the crowd as if giving it laldy in front of tens of thousands is what he was born to doHis new <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autobiography" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autobiography" target="_blank">autobiography</a> That Guy Fae The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" target="_blank">Corries</a> tells a different storyThe first time he took the stage was in the 40s at Nicholson Street Church in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_Festival" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_Festival" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> As a member of the Newington Scout troop the eightyearold got up to sing Josef Locke <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" target="_blank">song</a> Hear My Song ViolettaYoung Ronnie wore a pink and purple stripey Tshirt silk pantaloons with a sash at the waist a black beret and a false moustacheHe mimed on a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mandolin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mandolin" target="_blank">mandolin</a> while a pianist bashed away offstage All the while Ronnie was perched on a gokart with a silhouette of a gondola nailed to the backIt gets better He was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenade" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serenade" target="_blank">serenading</a> a fellow Scout Skinny who was clinging to a makeshift balcony resplendent in a blonde wing full makeup and his mum's evening dress with two oranges stuffed down the frontAfter a start like that it's hardly surprising that Browne did not rush to pursue a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" target="_blank">musical</a> careerInstead he went to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_College_of_Art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_College_of_Art" target="_blank">Edinburgh College of Art</a> painted portraits and became an art teacher But he wasn't earning much and it was the need for extra <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Cash" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Cash" target="_blank">cash</a> that propelled him towards performingIt was the beginning of the 60s Ronnie was married to childhood sweetheart <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pat_Boone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pat_Boone" target="_blank">Pat</a> and living in the capital's Shandon with their baby son And they were skint Then an art school chum Roy Williamson had a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" target="_blank">musical</a> emergency <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" target="_blank">Roy</a> had abandoned his student <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skiffle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skiffle" target="_blank">skiffle band</a> and joined a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" target="_blank">folk</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trio_%28music%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trio_%28music%29" target="_blank">trio</a> He and Ronnie had played and sung together at parties in each other's homes so when Roy's regular <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Singer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Singer" target="_blank">singer</a> came down with glandular fever just before a threeweek stint during the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_Festival" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh_Festival" target="_blank">Edinburgh Festival</a> Ronnie was drafted in as a substituteThe gig was at The Tryst a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coffeehouse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coffeehouse" target="_blank">coffee house</a> on the Royal Mile At the first rehearsal Ronnie recalls being âcrippled with nervesâ But the thought of earning &pound1 plus a taxi home powered him throughThe day before the show they came up with the name The Corrie Folk Trio and Paddie Bell Paddie was the female singerOn the night eight brave souls came in for a cup of coffee and found themselves faced by The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" target="_blank">Corrie</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" target="_blank">Folk</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trio_%28music%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trio_%28music%29" target="_blank">Trio</a> and Paddie BellThe next night they came back with their friends By the end of the week the house which held 80 was full By the end of their threeweek stint queues ran round the block The festival ended but they kept playing By 1963 when they made a <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Music" target="_blank">music</a>â Ronnie writes in his ebook âNonsense This <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musician" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musician" target="_blank">musician</a> was playing for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Cash" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Johnny_Cash" target="_blank">cash</a>â The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" target="_blank">Corries</a> gave up their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doris_Day" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doris_Day" target="_blank">day</a> jobs They were regulars on various TV shows and it was on one of these <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" target="_blank">Songs</a> of the Jacobite Risings in 1968 that the world first heard Roy's new <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_composition" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_composition" target="_blank">composition</a> Flower of Scotland It became a highlight of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Corries" target="_blank">Corries</a>' live set and by 1974 the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" target="_blank">song</a> had seeped beyond the live <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" target="_blank">folk</a> sceneRonnie writes âMore and more we would catch glimpses of it in television dramas usually some drunken <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scotsmen</a> leaving a bar and singing âOh Flower of Scotland Na Nya Na Nyaaaaa'âWithin the <a

point for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" target="_blank">song</a> came 15 years later just before <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" target="_blank">Roy</a> diedIn the runup to the 1990 Rugby <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Six_Nations_Championship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Six_Nations_Championship" target="_blank">Five Nations Championship</a> Ronnie was summoned to the Scottish Rugby Union He was told that during the last two seasons the team had sung Flower of Scotland under their breath during the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_anthem" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_anthem" target="_blank">national anthem</a> They wanted it to become the official replacement for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God_Save_the_Queen"

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" target="_blank">band</a>'s permissionâI said that no permission was requiredâ Ronnie writes âBoth <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" target="_blank">Roy</a> and I would be over the moonâIts <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_anthem" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_anthem" target="_blank">national anthem</a> debut was at the first game of the championship <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roy_Orbison" target="_blank">Roy</a> with a brain tumour and fading fast watched it on TV with âa broad smile on his faceâRonnie has performed the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Song" target="_blank">song</a> all over the world and has been its official <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Guardian" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Guardian" target="_blank">guardian</a> since Roy's death aged 54 in August 1990He writes âFlower of Scotland is constantly criticised as being antiEnglish But what could be more antiScottish than <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God_Save_the_Queen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God_Save_the_Queen" target="_blank">God Save The Queen</a> which we as the Scottish nation have been forced to sing over the yearsâ âIt has now become accepted the world over as <a

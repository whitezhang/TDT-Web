SHE'S been scared of heights all her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life" target="_blank">life</a> but that didn't stop Margaret Clarke from skydiving from 10000ft to help her sick <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" target="_blank">daughter</a> Margaret 70 took the plunge so her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" target="_blank">daughter</a> Lucy can travel to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow" target="_blank">Moscow</a> for a pioneering <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" target="_blank">stemcell</a> transplant which she hopes will stop the progression of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiple_sclerosis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiple_sclerosis" target="_blank">multiple sclerosis</a>  The skydive over St Andrews  Fife is one of several fundraising initiatives Lucy's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> are undertaking to raise the  &pound40000 needed for the treatment If the mumofone can secure funding she will be the first Scot to fly to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russia</a> for the cuttingedge procedureMargaret of Rosehall Sutherland said âBefore we took off I had a lot of butterflies in my tummy But I just kept thinking about why I was doing itâThere was a bit of trepidation but I didn't really think about it much I knew I was going to do it and that was thatâIt's strange but once I was in the plane and we took off I didn't feel frightened The whole thing was like an outofbody experience âIt took us 20 minutes to climb to 10000ft then it was time to jump out of the plane âWhen the parachute opened I could enjoy the views but I did start to feel travel sick We swayed back and forth  and from side to side but the landing felt absolutely brilliant  âIt was an amazing experience For me it was a means to an end â to help Lucy  and there was never any doubt I was  going to do itâ Margaret admitted she had a few sleepless nights before her tandem skydive on April 5She said âI was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nervous_system" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nervous_system" target="_blank">nervous</a> but it was something I wanted to do to help LucyâWhat <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mother</a> wouldn't jump out of a plane if they thought it would save their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" target="_blank">daughter</a> âI don't think I'm any different from any other <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a> whose <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_sexual_abuse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child_sexual_abuse" target="_blank">child</a> has suffered terribly with her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" target="_blank">illness</a> â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiple_sclerosis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiple_sclerosis" target="_blank">Multiple sclerosis</a> is a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disease" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disease" target="_blank">disease</a> that gets progressively worse over timeâIf we don't act now I don't want to think about where we will be in a few years timeâThe gran's bravery is the reason she has been nominated as a Senior <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hero" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hero" target="_blank">Hero</a> at the Daily Record Our Heroes awards on May 15The ceremony at the Thistle Hotel in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> sponsored by Lidl will honour those who go above and beyond to help othersMargaret added âIt's a real honour to be nominated Lucy is a wonderful <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Daughter" target="_blank">daughter</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mother</a> and wife She deserves a second chanceâHopefully we can raise the funds we need and this treatment will cure herâ Lucy was 29 when she was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnosis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnosis" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with MS in 2005 But her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symptom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symptom" target="_blank">symptoms</a> began when she was just 15Today she has trouble walking and finds it difficult to carry out routine tasks before becoming exhaustedIf the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" target="_blank">illness</a> isn't treated Lucy of Inverness could be confined to a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheelchair" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wheelchair" target="_blank">wheelchair</a> for the rest of her lifeShe desperately hopes to have a normal life again with husband Dan 43 and fouryear old son TheoLucy said âI was always a very active and productive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" target="_blank">person</a>âNow my MS makes it difficult for me to keep up with my son and even do the most basic of household tasksâOther people who have had the treatment have told me that it has transformed their lives and I really hope I will be that fortunate It would be wonderful to be able to play with my son while he is still young and be like other mums and walk him to school and go to the park â things that other <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">families</a> take for grantedâMS is a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disease" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disease" target="_blank">disease</a> of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_nervous_system" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_nervous_system" target="_blank">central nervous system</a> that causes a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" target="_blank">person</a>'s <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autoimmunity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autoimmunity" target="_blank">autoimmune system</a> to start attacking <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cell_%28biology%29" target="_blank">cells</a> in their own <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brain" target="_blank">brain</a> and spinal columnIt is hoped the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" target="_blank">stemcell</a> transplant will stop the MS from getting worse and potentially reverse the damage already done The procedure â <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hematopoietic_stem_cell" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hematopoietic_stem_cell" target="_blank">haematopoietic stem cell</a> transplantation â is not widely available in the UK on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" target="_blank">NHS</a> or privately as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinical_trial" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinical_trial" target="_blank">clinical trials</a> are ongoing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health" target="_blank">Healthy</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" target="_blank">stem cells</a> will be taken from Lucy's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone_marrow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone_marrow" target="_blank">bone marrow</a> and her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disease" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disease" target="_blank">diseased</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immune_system" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immune_system" target="_blank">immune system</a>  will be wiped out with intensive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemotherapy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemotherapy" target="_blank">chemotherapy</a> Her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health" target="_blank">healthy</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" target="_blank">stem cells</a> will then build an undamaged <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immunity_%28medical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immunity_%28medical%29" target="_blank">immune</a> systemThere are risks with the treatment but many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> including two from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/England" target="_blank">England</a> have shown positive resultsDoctors have advised it may take up to two years for Lucy to fully recover from the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stem_cell" target="_blank">stemcell</a> transplantHer <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immune_system" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immune_system" target="_blank">immune system</a> will be severely compromised for several monthsAs part of her monthlong stay in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow" target="_blank">Moscow</a> next month she will spend seven to 14 days in isolation Only when Lucy's ânewâ <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immune_system" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immune_system" target="_blank">immune system</a> is strong enough will she be discharged from hospitalStill at risk of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infection" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infection" target="_blank">infection</a> she will have to wear a face mask to protect herself during her return trip to ScotlandMargaret said âMS has robbed Lucy of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life" target="_blank">life</a> she deserved and we are hoping the treatment will workâShe copes with so much just to get through every dayâSome mornings she wakes up and doesn't know whether she's going to be able to walkâIt's a cruel <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Illness" target="_blank">illness</a> and Lucy can suffer a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relapse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relapse" target="_blank">relapse</a> at any timeâHer mobility has reduced over the last 10 years and everyday tasks are becoming increasingly difficult or impossible to doâShe refuses to let it beat her and is determined to do all she can to live <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Life" target="_blank">life</a> to the fullâ Lucy's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> have launched a website to raise awareness of the campaign and other friends and  relatives are helping to raise money Her nephew Jamie Clarke 10 intends to swim a mile to raise money to help his auntieLucy said âSo many people are being really supportive I'm really touched by my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a>'s braveryâGoing to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moscow" target="_blank">Moscow</a> for this lifechanging treatment is the only way to halt further physical

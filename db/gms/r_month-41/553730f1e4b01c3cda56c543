anyoneâWe are interested in speaking to anyone who may have seen Karen in the early hours of Sunday morning in the west end of Glasgow in order to help with our inquiries to locate her âWe're particularly keen to get <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_Touch_Weekly" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_Touch_Weekly" target="_blank">in touch</a> with the gentleman who Karen was seen

A SCOTS <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" target="_blank">soldier</a> who stamped on a man's head 18 times walked free yesterday â and could keep his jobDrinkfuelled Scots Guard Shaun Smith 25 was caught on CCTV mercilessly bringing his boot down repeatedly on helpless James WormaldHis Welsh Guard pal Jason Collins 22 â who has stood guard at Buckingham and St James's palaces â pummelled the victim with his fistsThe pair had already knocked James's friend Mark Thompson out coldOne longserving detective described the CCTV footage of the attack in the garrison town of Catterick Yorkshire as the most violent he had ever witnessedThe imprint of Smith's boot was clearly visible on James's face after the attackBut a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" target="_blank">judge</a> at Teesside <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_Court" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crown_Court" target="_blank">Crown Court</a> yesterday freed the thugs â and it was revealed that both could stay in the ArmyJudge Jamie Hill QC â who was told that the Army wanted to keep both men â admitted that his decision was âentirely exceptionalâCollins who was given <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Community_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Community_service" target="_blank">community service</a> is set to keep his job while the fate of Smith who was given a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suspended_sentence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suspended_sentence" target="_blank">suspended sentence</a> will be decided by his commanding officerMore <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" target="_blank">courts</a> newsLast night James who said the savage attack was unprovoked and out of the blue said he had been robbed of justiceHe said he had been sickened to see the video and added âI don't know how I escaped that without really serious injuriesâThe force they used could have <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> me and I really expected them to go to jail for itâBut to hear that they will not go to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" target="_blank">prison</a> and will probably keep their jobs is sickening â it's just crazyâ   Record View Thug <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" target="_blank">soldiers</a> shame the Army The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" target="_blank">soldiers</a> had matched each other drink for drink before the earlyhours assault last April downing six Budweisers 14 sweet and sour shots and a JagerbombThey admitted actual bodily harmDetective Constable Andy Palmer said the footage was the most violent piece of CCTV he had seen in 10 years as a police officer He added âIt is extremely fortunate that the victims were not more seriously injuredâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" target="_blank">Judge</a> Hill described Smith's part in the attack as âdeeply unpleasant and inexcusableâ but imposed a 12month <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" target="_blank">jail</a> term suspended for 12 months 80 hours' unpaid work and compensation of &pound1000 to be paid to James Collins was given a 12month community order and ordered to pay &pound500 each to the two victimsCaptain James Dyson of the Scots Guards said a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suspended_sentence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suspended_sentence" target="_blank">suspended sentence</a> would not mean an automatic discharge from the Army but it would be for a commanding officer to decide whether there were âexceptional circumstancesâ which would allow Smith to stay in serviceJudge Hill said âI can't say what the Army will do but I simply express the hope that the Army feels able to keep youâSmith who is based at Wellington Barracks near Buckingham Palace left <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" target="_blank">court</a> separately from Collins who is based at Pirbright Barracks in SurreyNeither made any commentRichard Herrman for Smith said âBut for that night this man is an angel But on that night he was a devil This is something that will bear on his mind for the rest of his lifeâCaptain Dyson called Smith âone of the bestperforming people in his platoonâHe said Smith had overcome a difficult early life and had lost a lot of weight in his battle to get fit enough to join the ArmySean Grainger for Collins told the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Court" target="_blank">court</a> âHe has been entrusted to stand guard at Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace while these proceedings have been going onâThat shows the high level of regard he is held in by the Welsh Guardsâ

LITTLE Max Girvan was only six when he died but nearly five years on his smile laughter and courage are still an inspiration to his familyBorn with a congenital condition as well as a number of complications Max was confined to a wheelchair partially sighted and only able to communicate through sounds and facial expressionsDoctors didn't expect him to survive beyond a year but his determination to live â and smile â still motivates his family to help other children in similar situationsTomorrow his older brother David O'Neill 30 will kick off a 156mile challenge at Hampden Park as he aims to do six 26mile Kiltwalks across Scotland this summer to raise funds for charities close to his heartHe said âHe is my inspiration We called him our Little BraveheartâWatching him struggle was the hardest part for me â he fought every day just to live and breatheâCompared to what he went through me walking 26 miles is nothingâHe was always chuckling and brought us all so much joyâ Last year he took part in the 26mile <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> Kiltwalk with an 11strong Marching for Max team which included his dad John and younger brother Jack 14His mum Margaret and younger sisters KatieJane 15 and Casey eight were at the finishing line cheering them onDavid added âIt was such a fantastic experience that I can't wait to do all six this yearâThere was such a lovely atmosphere and the way all the walkers encouraged each other was amazingâI was exhausted by the end but I was also absolutely elatedâCrossing the finishing line was one of the best feelings in my life especially as there were so many people there cheering us onâThis year he is hoping to have a team of 20 or more take part in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> event tomorrow with nearly a dozen walking in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> next month and smaller groups in the walks in Aberdeen <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perth,_Western_Australia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perth,_Western_Australia" target="_blank">Perth</a> Speyside and DundeeHe said âI can't wait to take part in all six walks and I am determined to encourage as many people as possible to join meâNot only will they be supporting so many fantastic organisations which help children like Max I know they will have a lot of funâWhen Max was born in 2004 his family already knew what it was like to have a child with disabilitiesHis older sister KatieJane was born with a condition which left her partially blind and with limited mobilityHowever when Max was born with Pierre Robin Syndrome as well as complications with his sight stomach and respiratory system the family were not prepared for the extent of care he would needDavid from Bathgate West Lothian said âWhen KatieJane was born it came as a huge shock to have a baby with a disability as we had no history of anything like that on either side of the familyâBut when Max came along we already had some experience and were a little less apprehensiveâWe thought his needs might be similar to those of KatieJaneâBut as beautiful as he was and as happy as we were to have him it soon became clear that Max's condition was far more serious and that it would have a huge knockon effect for the rest of the familyâHe was a massive part of our family though and always will beâMax's condition meant he regularly suffered seizures which would see him in hospital for weeks at a timeJohn had to stop working to support his wife who had already given up her job when KatieJane was bornAnd for David then 19 having a second disabled sibling meant a lot of adjustmentThe IT account manager with Cisco said âHaving a severely disabled child in the family can have a huge emotional effect on the family as it alters the dynamic and impacts on the other kidsâPlus daily life can become all about logistics and about making arrangementsâWhat I remember most was thinking about the fact my brother and sister wouldn't lead normal livesâThey wouldn't be able to do the kind of things I had always taken for granted like go to school and choose what they want to do when they leaveâWhen Max came along I began to think about even smaller things that he would simply never be able to enjoy â like the fact he would never really know what the sun looks likeâWhen he was well enough Max was able to attend Beatlie School for children with special needs in West Lothian and have respite careBut in 2010 he contracted septicaemia and died suddenly at home with his family at his side  David said âThere had been signs that he was deteriorating but it still happened really quicklyâHe was at home though and surrounded by his family and while I don't think my parents will ever recover from losing a child I think that through the grief it has brought us all comfort to know that he is no longer in pain or strugglingâThroughout Max's short life the family were hugely grateful for the help and support they had received from the NHS <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a>'s Sick Kids Hospital staff at Beatlie and at Sunndach respite care in helping to make what little time they had memorableIn the aftermath of Max's death David and the rest of the family realised they would like to do what they could to help the organisations who helped them during their time togetherThrough his employers he organised a team to help repaint rooms at Sunndach respite care centre And thanks to donations made at Max's funeral together with a contribution from Cisco a special room was created at Sunndach which is now called Max's DenAnd as the team march tomorrow in the Kiltwalk they will be raising even more money for the organisations who really made a difference to Max's lifeThe <a

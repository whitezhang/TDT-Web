 ANGIE Allan's friends thought she was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Insanity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Insanity" target="_blank">barking mad</a> when she adopted a 10stone rescue dog from Spain  But the 48yearold says saving Spanish mastin Tigger from a âhorrific <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" target="_blank">death</a>â is one of the best things she's ever done The mum of three spotted the pooch on a Spanish animal charity website and realising he was going to be destroyed set the wheels in motion to bring him to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" target="_blank">Scotland</a> After a month in his new home oneyearold Tigger is settling in well to life in Dumfries   Angie said âA lot of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> have been asking me why I'd bring a dog like Tigger to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland_Yard" target="_blank">Scotland</a> but the simple reason is  that he'll have a chance to live here  âThese kinds of dogs are used to protect homes in SpainâBut if they're not wanted then they're usually just dumped in the middle of nowhere and left to dieâSometimes they are even beaten to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" target="_blank">death</a> âIt's not like Britain where we love our pets and look after as many as we can Any that are found alive wandering as strays are taken to âkill stations'âIf they're not claimed or rescued then they are <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> to make room for moreâAngie who is also the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Gaelic" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Gaelic" target="_blank">Scottish</a> manager for Birdline UK Parrot Rescue said some people find Tigger intimidating but he's really a âgentle giantâShe told our sister paper the Dumfries &amp <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galloway" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Galloway" target="_blank">Galloway</a> Standard âStanding on his hind legs he is more than 5ft 9in tallâSome people do back off from him because of his size but he's only interested in cuddles He doesn't realise how big he is â he's just a gentle giantâDespite what he's been through he's absolutely fantasticâHe's named Tigger because he looks like a tiger due to the striped pattern on his coat but we can't change the name as he was called that in Spain and he only really responds to thatâ

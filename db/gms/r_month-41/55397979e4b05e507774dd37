title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" target="_blank">crack</a> just days after he rubbed shoulders with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" target="_blank">Peter Mullan</a> and Muriel Gray at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland"

lives and has two sets of friends â the guys he's involved with through his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" target="_blank">acting</a> and his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gangster" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gangster" target="_blank">gangster</a> palsâVery few of his customers will even know about his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" target="_blank">BAFTA</a> winâThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Addiction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Addiction" target="_blank">addict</a> added âMy big weakness is <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" target="_blank">crack</a> Once you've tried it you just want more and moreâIt wrecks your life You don't care what you have to do to get money to get moreâKash knows this He doesn't look like he touches the stuff himselfâIt's just a moneymaker for him That's what makes me sick He'll keep selling and selling until you have no money then phone you back later and ask if you want moreâWhat angers me is that he doesn't have to do this He's a clever guy and he can get a proper jobâBut he prefers to make easy money pushing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" target="_blank">crack</a>â The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Addiction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Addiction" target="_blank">addict</a> said Ikunda brags of links to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gangster" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gangster" target="_blank">gangsters</a> and sells <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" target="_blank">heroin</a> as well as crackHe explained âHe went to Govan High School which is tough but he was trendy and popular so it was easy for him to make contactsâHe still has contacts in London that he gets <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a> fromâHe knows <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" target="_blank">crack</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Addiction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Addiction" target="_blank">addicts</a> will sometimes use <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" target="_blank">heroin</a> to bring them down from the effects The withdrawal can be terribleâIkunda is active around the Shawbridge high flats in the Shawlands area of GlasgowWe followed him as he dropped off <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drug" target="_blank">drugs</a> around <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> in the days after his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" target="_blank">BAFTA</a> winAnd we caught him redhanded by posing as a potential customer ringing his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mobile_phone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mobile_phone" target="_blank">mobile</a> under an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudonym" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudonym" target="_blank">assumed name</a> and arranging to buy a &pound20 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music" target="_blank">rock</a> of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crack_cocaine" target="_blank">crack</a> Ikunda a talented footballer arranged to meet us beside a fiveaside pitch where he regularly plays with  his mates He arrived in a sporty grey Volkswagen Golf and phoned to say he was ready to do the deal in the car parkIkunda told our man âI can give you one <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rock_music" target="_blank">rock</a> for 20 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quid_pro_quo" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quid_pro_quo" target="_blank">quid</a> but it's 30 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quid_pro_quo" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quid_pro_quo" target="_blank">quid</a> for two so you'd be getting the other one halfpriceâI can't do it any cheaper because there's not much about just nowâWe phoned Ikunda again yesterday to ask if he could set up another deal and he urged our investigator to buy in bulk to get a better priceHe said âSix rocks would normally be &pound120 but you're going to get it for a discount price which would be &pound90âWe then asked if he could supply us with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" target="_blank">heroin</a> known on the streets as âbrownâHe replied âUhhuh I can maybe speak to my man about that too yeahâ Days before Ikunda had given a newspaper <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" target="_blank">interview</a> to bask in the glory of his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" target="_blank">BAFTA</a> awardHe won for his role in short film Happy Together the story of a homeless youth who forms a close <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bond" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/James_Bond" target="_blank">bond</a> with a lonely old woman Ikunda posed grinning with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" target="_blank">Peter Mullan</a> at the ceremony and will  soon be starring alongside him in  Hec McAdam a road movie about a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homelessness" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Homelessness" target="_blank">homeless</a> man from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> who heads for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> He told the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" target="_blank">interviewer</a> â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" target="_blank">Peter Mullan</a> is a great guy We had a good time and I asked him a few questions and he gave me some adviceâHe added âActors like <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peter_Mullan" target="_blank">Peter</a> and James McAvoy inspire me because they have worked hard to get to where they are without a lot of help or moneyâIt's a difficult industry to break into but I write <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Screenplay" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Screenplay" target="_blank">screenplays</a> too just in case Basically I'm writing myself a jobâYou sit on the sidelines waiting for parts that don't come that often And when they do you have a roomful of people doing the same thing You have to work hard but I'm willing to do thatâAstonishingly Ikunda also claimed in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interview" target="_blank">interview</a> that he moved to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> to escape a life of crimeHis parents fled to the UK capital from the wartorn Democratic Republic of CongoBut Ikunda said âI had to leave <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> The peer pressure and environment wasn't goodâThere's a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gang" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gang" target="_blank">gang culture</a> there and you can get mixed up in things young boys shouldn't get mixed up inâSome of the boys I went to school with now have criminal records I could have been one of those boys I didn't want to leave <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> but maybe it was a blessing in disguiseâIkunda also claimed that being black made it hard for him to make friends in GlasgowHe said âIt was like going to this area where you were more like a display in the museum Everybody is looking at you like a walking tourist attractionâI kind of lost touch with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" target="_blank">acting</a> to begin with because I was just trying to adjust to living in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAFTA_Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a>âI already felt separated because I was black and I thought showing my passion for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" target="_blank">acting</a> might separate me from my peers even moreâWe phoned Ikunda to tell him we planned to expose his activities There was silence at the other end of the lineWe invited him to our offices to discuss the case He did not respond

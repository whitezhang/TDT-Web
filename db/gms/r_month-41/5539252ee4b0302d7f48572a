IT was watching kids curl up and go to sleep in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" target="_blank">Kenyan</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classroom" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Classroom" target="_blank">classroom</a> that hit Brian McPhee hardest Sleeping in their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> because they were too scared to close their eyes at nightThis <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">footballer</a> turned firefighter gave up his holidays last year to travel to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Africa" target="_blank">Africa</a> to try to make a make a difference to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a>'s lives Little did he know how attached he would become to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a> of NakuruAfter a twoweek <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" target="_blank">charity</a> assignment to work as a classroom assistant in a churchrun <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">dad</a> of two who had been immersed in the hard world of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">football</a> for almost 20 years as a prolific striker with Airdrie Livingston and Hamilton had to return to his job as a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> firemanBut on the flight home the 44yearold knew he'd return to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a> he'd left behind Kids who now had Celtic tops donated by pals in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">game</a> And goalie gloves from former Partick Thistle keeper Kenny Arthur Boys and girls who had nothing before he and fellow <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scots</a> Eddie McGaw and Lori Gallagher joined by an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/English_language" target="_blank">English</a> girl Laura Birtles arrived at their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> last NovemberNow McPhee is trying to raise the &pound1700 he needs to go back to help a little bit more This time he'll be more ready for the sights that moved him to tears on occasionHe said âIt was hard but it was the experience of a lifetime It all started when I played with the Dukla Pumpherston <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" target="_blank">charity</a> team and we all got a text from Eddie asking if anybody would be interested in going to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" target="_blank">Kenya</a> to do some <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charitable_trust" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charitable_trust" target="_blank">charity work</a>âMy own kids are now older 18 and 25 so that wasn't holding me back and it just fell in with my holidays I contacted Eddie and spoke to my partner Jennifer telling her I really wanted to do something like this She just said âGo for it' âI wasn't aware I'd be going to work in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> but I knew I was going to Nakuru in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" target="_blank">Kenya</a> to work with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a> I was basically a teacher's assistant for two weeks But I did a lot of footballrelated stuff with the kids A lot of my friends donated kit and equipment They were soon running around in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">football</a> strips and training bibs kicking the small footballs I'd taken with meâBut it wasn't all fun and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">football</a> The squalor the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a> lived in shocked him As did the lives they were forced to lead They didn't just come to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> known as the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imogen_Heap" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imogen_Heap" target="_blank">Walk</a> Centre to learn It was also their sanctuaryHe said âThere were 150 of them in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> and they all lived on landfill sites around the town Rubbish dumps basicallyâThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> is a release for them because of the conditions they live in I must admit there were <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> I had to have a few minutes on my own to have a wee cryâThe first couple of days went past in a blur because of all the excitement of just arriving and everything being new to us But when you settle down and begin to realise the squalor that these kids are growing up in it's hard to takeâEvery day they went for a sleep about two o'clock in the afternoon The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teacher" target="_blank">teacher</a> told me a lot of the kids come from single parent families and most of their mothers are <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">prostitutes</a> The mothers go out at night leaving the kids on their own and they are so scared they don't sleepâSo for a couple of hours in the afternoon they get the chance to catch up on their sleep for an hour in a safe environmentâAnd yet their attitude <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiddler_on_the_Roof" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fiddler_on_the_Roof" target="_blank">to life</a> still makes McPhee <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smile" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Smile" target="_blank">smile</a> He added âThey were such lovely <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Child" target="_blank">children</a> Their smiles melted all our hearts One day we thought âLet's do something different' So we went out and bought 150 bars of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chocolate" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chocolate" target="_blank">chocolate</a> to give them all a wee treatâHalf the kids hadn't tasted <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chocolate" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chocolate" target="_blank">chocolate</a> in their lives and they absolutely loved it But they still had the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart_%28band%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart_%28band%29" target="_blank">heart</a> to break a bit off and offer it to us That just finished me off again âI had to go to a wee <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office" target="_blank">office</a> for another cryâYou need &pound1700 to go but last year I raised more than &pound2000 and rather than just donating the extra money to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" target="_blank">charity</a> we took it over with us to see how we could use it to help <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> when we got there â &pound300 goes a long way in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kenya" target="_blank">Kenya</a> We asked the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> what they wanted done to make things a little easier âThey told us they needed the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" target="_blank">toilets</a> cleaned up but we took it a step further and put proper <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" target="_blank">toilets</a> inâThere was a warehouse where we could buy the raw materials We did the labouring while we hired a local plumber and other local tradespeople That meant the money was going into the community âWe also went to a local <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orphanage" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orphanage" target="_blank">orphanage</a> St Jerome's and built them two new <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" target="_blank">toilets</a> and washhand basins We bought two goats so they'd have <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milk" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Milk" target="_blank">milk</a> and at a local maternity hospital we handed out baby clothes We know we were barely <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graffiti" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Graffiti" target="_blank">scratching</a> the surface but even making a tiny difference is better than doing nothing âThat's why I want to go back to the same <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> this November I want to try to keep making that tiny differenceâBrian McPhee has seen enough to know Bill Shankly was talking nonsense when he said âSome people believe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">football</a> is a matter of life and death I can assure you it is much much more important than thatâ Shankly's fellow <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scot</a> knows betterAnyone wishing to help Brian reach his &pound1700 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Target_Corporation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Target_Corporation" target="_blank">target</a> then please go to

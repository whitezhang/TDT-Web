href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> rent strikes of 1915 which forced a change in the law to curtail profiteering

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a>'s City Chambers Sir Alex said &quotI take great pride in coming from Govan It's a place where I grew up learning the value of hard graft resolve and resilience&quotMary Barbour is also from Govan and possessed all these attributes She successfully mobilised people from far and wide to take direct action against social injustice and changed the law of the land&quotA formidable firebrand she was courageous and compassionate in equal measure I'm delighted at this opportunity to pay my respects to Mary Barbour with my &pound5000 donation to the Remember Mary Barbour Fund&quotThe scheme which Sir Alex is supporting came about following a motion by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">Councillor</a> Pauline McKeever in May 2013 urging the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City_council"

&quotIt would be such a pity if her contribution to women and children and a fairer society was allowed to fade&quotIt's high time she received permanent recognition and it's wonderful that the Remember Mary Barbour campaign to erect a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statue" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Statue" target="_blank">statue</a> in her memory will finally allow a lasting tribute to her vision courage and convictions&quot The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> rent strikes took place at

A notorious <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillor</a> who caused a scandal by burning the Smith Commission report has slammed his colleagues for caring more about their local community than the fight for independenceAn explosive <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" target="_blank">email</a> leaked to the Daily Record show Will Mylet ridiculed his colleagues in the nationalists' <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" target="_blank">Renfrewshire</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" target="_blank">Council</a> group for working to help their âown wee areaâ rather than furthering the cause of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland's</a> âfreedomâThe rant  sent just five days after <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scots</a> had decisively rejected <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" target="_blank">independence</a> in last year's referendum  is sure to anger Paisley residents blighted by a range of social and economic problemsIt also lays bare a bitter turf war between more moderate members of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a>'s most controversial <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" target="_blank">council</a> group and proindependence hardlinersMylet made headlines across <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> last year when he was among a group of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillors</a> who filmed themselves burning the Smith Commission report on more powers and posted the video on the internet But the Daily Record can today reveal he had earlier caused chaos in his own <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> branch with a fierce attack on other <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillors</a> he suggested were not committed enough to the causeLabour last night seized on the leaked <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" target="_blank">emails</a> as proof the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> are only interested in independenceThe angry <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" target="_blank">email</a> exchange took place after the first <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire"

target="_blank">Council</a> group meeting held after the referendum descended into chaosThe Record understands the 14 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillors</a> in the group were split between those who wanted to focus on local issues causing problems in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" target="_blank">Renfrewshire</a> and those who wanted to continue to focus on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" target="_blank">independence</a> at the expense of everything elseLater that night one <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillor</a> Stephen McGee emailed the entire group to note he was âextremely embarrassed by the conduct and management of the groupâHe added âAfter all the issues that we have went through over the last year and a half frankly I have better things to do with my time that watch our group implode in on itselfâBut his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" target="_blank">email</a> received a furious response from Mylet early the next morningThe Paisley East and Ralston <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillor</a> attacked McGee and another <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillor</a> Andy Doig for drafting motions for the next <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" target="_blank">Renfrewshire</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" target="_blank">Council</a> meeting which they thought would help the areaâWhilst Andy was looking desperately for any motion for his own wee area I was arranging a street stall to continue the campaign for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" target="_blank">independence</a>â he wroteâI do not want to be an old man and the rest of the current group in their graves before <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> gets another chance of freedomâIf that doesn't get you going enough then remember these famous words âWhats [sic] that got to do with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Independence,_Missouri" target="_blank">independence</a>'âAnd in further comments that will heap more embarrassment on the party Mylet alsoâ¢ Branded local <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" target="_blank">MSP</a> George Adam the âalleged <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" target="_blank">MSP</a> for Paisleyââ¢ Attacked McGee for being âspinelessâ for raising concerns about the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Council_of_Europe" target="_blank">council</a> groupâ¢ Suggested Doig is âlazyâ and took too much âtime offâ during the referendum campaignLabour's Renfrewshire South <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Member_of_the_Scottish_Parliament" target="_blank">MSP</a> Hugh Henry said âNow we can see why these <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillors</a> were such an embarrassment to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> âJudging by these comments the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">councillors</a> clearly loathe each other but what is worse is the contempt being shown for the democratic decision of the people of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> âThe refusal by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">Councillor</a> Mylet to accept the referendum result shows why he and his colleagues took the extreme action of burning the copy of the Smith Agreement report âThere's a clear split in the local <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> group with the fundamentalists like <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">Councillor</a> Mylet dominating their fellow members and being more interested in pursuing narrow nationalism than serving the people who elected themâBut Mylet defended his comments and insisted they were merely âconstructive criticismââI think every single organisation or group have fall outs but it doesn't last for longâ he told the Record âIt's kind of like a family in that you have some cross words and then move onâMylet made headlines in December just days after the Smith Commission published its report on new powers for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Gaelic" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Gaelic" target="_blank">Scottish</a> &shyGovernment in the wake of the No voteHe was

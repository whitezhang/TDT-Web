A FAILED doctor jailed for hoarding ingredients for a chemical bomb did not work alone his brother has told the Daily RecordFaris alKhori 62 stockpiled chemicals capable of making bombs and toxic beans which could manufacture the poison ricin in his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> flatThe Syrian medic â who was sentenced to 40 months yesterday â was only caught after a blaze at the tower block alerted firefighters to the deadly haulHis brother Dr Fareed alKhori 56 a heart specialist in the US told the Record his brother could not have carried out the bomb plot on his own and must have been âtaken advantage ofâ by sinister forces behind the scenesPolice and prosecutors believe Faris alKhori acted alone following a massive police investigation involving more than 100 officersThey concluded alKhori â described as a âWalter Mittycharacterâ by his defence QC â was not connected to any terrorist groupBut his brother Fareed told the Record âI believe someone was taking advantage of him I don't believe he did this aloneâDetectives discovered Faris had failed his exams to practice medicine in the UK âmore than ten timesâ since arriving here in 1984 His brother denied that Faris's failure to make the grade as a UK doctor â while he enjoyed his own highly successful career in North Carolina â led to his crimesHe added âThat would not prompt him to do such thingsâDr alKhori was quizzed by FBI agents after his brother's activities were discovered last April in a bid to uncover potential motives He said âThe last time I spoke to him was when our mother died a few years ago âI've been trying to figure out what's going onâThis is not my brother This is not the person I knew He's not this kind of personâHe said his family including his brother were practising Christians with no connections with âpolitical issues or radical religionsâDr alKhori is undergoing treatment for cancer in the States and is on leave from his jobYesterday the High Court in Edinburgh was told his brother had tests while in prison to see if he could be a bone marrow donor for his sick siblingHis cancer is being treated after another alKhori brother in Syria was able to provide a bone marrow match and his prognosis is said to be âhopefulâ Faris alKhori who trained as a doctor in Iraq but lived on benefits in Scotland pled guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosives Substances ActThe chemicals were only unearthed by chance following a fire in a rubbish chute on the 11th floor of a tower block in Muirhouse EdinburghFirefighters forcing doors to check no one was inside nearby flats entered a property where alKhori had a tenancyThey found items that gave them cause for concern â including mustard jars containing white powder and one marked âweed killerâ â and the building was evacuated A search of alKhori's home in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leith" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leith" target="_blank">Leith</a> area of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> recovered  more potentially dangerous substances Detective Superintendent David Gordon who led the investigation said alKhori continually failed to pass medical exams through the Royal College of Surgeons and the General Medical CouncilDet Supt Gordon added âIt was one of the lines of inquiry that we looked at in terms of the potential frustration but there was nothing to indicate he held any grudgeâThere was nothing to indicate motivation or identify any targeting of individuals or any link to a terrorism organsisationâ AlKhori moved from England to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> in the late 1980s where he met his wife JanetHe never visited the Middle East againAlKhori later became his wife's carer after she suffered mental health problems including schizophreniaDet Supt Gordon said alKhori spent âvast amounts of timeâ on the internet often looking at news sites and was a âvery private but very strange individualâ and a âcreature of habitâThe officer said that the chemicals could have caused âconsiderable damageâ if they had come into contact with the blaze in the highrise AlKhori acquired the chemicals online mainly through Amazon between 2007 and last April at a cost of &pound691He also had large amounts of nails ball bearings rods bolts and nuts which could be used in a bombOfficers initially feared he was part of a wide terror cell â perhaps acting as the storekeeper â but said their investigation showed he acted aloneDefence counsel Brian McConnachie QC told the court yesterday âThe Crown accepts that he had never made or attempted to make any kind of improvised explosive deviceâMcConnachie added âThis is a man for whom violence appears to be nowhere in his contemplationâ The materials â which included acetone hydrogen peroxide mercury and lead picrate â were discovered in April last year after a fire in a communal area of a flat at Fidra Court in the Muirhouse area of EdinburghFire crews searching the building forced entry to a flat registered to alKhori and found jars containing various powdersCastor beans which can be used to make ricin were also foundThe building was evacuated while the substances â some of which were years old â were testedHandwritten notes and instructions which âappeared to be instructions on how to prepare explosives and bombsâ were also discoveredFurther material was later unearthed at a property in Persevere Court <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leith" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leith" target="_blank">Leith</a> and explosives experts were called in againPassing sentence Lady Wolffe said âYou assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated areaâThey were only found by chance by the fire serviceâAlKhori who has been the fulltime carer for his wife was born in the Syrian capital of Damascus and trained as a doctor in Iraq before moving to AustriaHe has been a British citizen since 1998 but has never practised medicine in the UKTry our quick news quiz below

AN ELECTRICIAN has told how his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ear" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ear" target="_blank">ears</a> âmelted offâ in a highvoltage <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" target="_blank">explosion</a> after a giant defence firm ignored <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safety" target="_blank">safety</a> lawsStevie Delargey also suffered horrific burns to his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand" target="_blank">hands</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neck" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neck" target="_blank">neck</a> and was off work for almost a year as he <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endurance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endurance" target="_blank">endured</a> terrifying flashbacks of the accidentThe 51yearold was hired as a contractor to replace <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capacitor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capacitor" target="_blank">capacitors</a> at Raytheon Systems' bomb factory in Glenrothes â while the building's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electricity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electricity" target="_blank">electrical system</a> was live A <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capacitor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capacitor" target="_blank">capacitor</a> fell on to the live conductor causing a âflashoverâ that severely <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trauma_%28medicine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trauma_%28medicine%29" target="_blank">injured</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" target="_blank">Stevie</a> and his C&ampF Electrical Services colleague Russell BrandStevie who had carried out work on the plant for decades had asked Raytheon to isolate the section he was working on from the electricity supply â but bosses at the American company refused because they didn't want to interrupt productionHe said âI asked them to isolate the busbars â the main board we were working on that was still live â but they wouldn't do it They said it had to be on 247 365 days a yearâThere was an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_arc" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_arc" target="_blank">electrical arc</a> and it exploded in my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Face" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Face" target="_blank">face</a>âMy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" target="_blank">head</a> went on fire and I had to pat it out with my hands The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" target="_blank">skin</a> was dripping off my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Face" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Face" target="_blank">face</a> like wax My <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ear" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ear" target="_blank">ears</a> were melting off â they're smaller nowâ Raytheon who last year made a profit of &pound65million in the UK alone were last week fined &pound24000 at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court over the incidentProsecutors said the firm wanted to âcut costs at the expense of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Safety" target="_blank">safety</a>â and a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_and_Safety_Executive" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_and_Safety_Executive" target="_blank">Health and Safety Executive</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" target="_blank">investigation</a> found the work shouldn't have gone ahead and that there was âno urgencyâ for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capacitor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capacitor" target="_blank">capacitors</a> to be replacedStevie hit out at the fine saying âI think &pound24000 is a paltry sum for a global company of that sizeâThey put two workers in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> by failing to adhere to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_and_Safety_Executive" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_and_Safety_Executive" target="_blank">health and safety</a> laws I can't even put a figure on thatâRaytheon don't allow us to work with them any more I'd been working at that plant since I was 16 so I'm disappointedâAfter the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accident" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accident" target="_blank">accident</a> in 2011 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" target="_blank">Stevie</a> from Kirkcaldy spent four days in intensive care at Queen Margaret <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">Hospital</a> in Dunfermline before being moved to the specialist burns unit at Dundee's Ninewells HospitalRecalling the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychological_trauma" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychological_trauma" target="_blank">traumatic event</a> his partner Carolyn Cruden 51 said âWhen he was being rushed to ospital he looked at me and said âIt's OK we've just had a wee <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accident" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accident" target="_blank">accident</a>'âHis whole <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" target="_blank">head</a> was like a big blister and his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand" target="_blank">hands</a> were blackâThe doctors were so surprised they didn't need to do any <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" target="_blank">skin</a> graftsâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" target="_blank">Stevie</a> who has received about &pound40000 in compensation added âThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Skin" target="_blank">skin</a> on my hands is brand new now â it's only three years old I have to wear factor 50 every time I go outâBut despite the horrific burns that left him with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scar" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scar" target="_blank">scars</a> on his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neck" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neck" target="_blank">neck</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand" target="_blank">hands</a> he said the most difficult thing to deal with was his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mental_health" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mental_health" target="_blank">mental health</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stevie_Wonder" target="_blank">Stevie</a> explained âMy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" target="_blank">head</a> was all over the place I got nightmares and flashbacks and recurring dreams about itâI was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnosis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnosis" target="_blank">diagnosed</a> with posttraumatic stress disorder and thought I'd never work againâIt happened in December 2011 and I didn't start back until the next NovemberâBut I got a lot of help Carolyn was incredible she helped me with everything from getting dressed to eatingâMy work were very good with me and allowed me to have a staggered returnâI had an occupational therapist a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_therapy" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physical_therapy" target="_blank">physiotherapist</a> and psychotherapistâThe PTSD was the worst though It's a terrible thing I think I've near enough fully recovered now although I still have thoughts about itâLast August we revealed how laserguidance systems made at Raytheon's Glenrothes factory were used in the smart bombs dropped during Israel's aerial bombardment of GazaTheir huge Paveway II bombs were used during the 2014 assaultRaytheon and Glenrothesbased C&ampF Electrical Services both pled guilty to two charges on indictment under the

THE RECORD'S focus on a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> in Grangemouth provided a snapshot of the meltdown facing the GP service in ScotlandWe told how two doctors â instead of eight â remain at Kerseibank Medical Practice to look after 10000 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> amid a recruitment crisisStresses of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" target="_blank">job</a> mean older GPs seek to retire early while young doctors turn their back on general practiceWith an election looming politicians are queueing up to appoint themselves as saviours of the NHSHere DR ClAIRE SCOTT â a GP at a semirural practice in Fife â tells Mark McGivern how doctors fear politicians are offering pieinthesky promises in the face of a very real crisis WITH the general election looming there have been many articles on the staffing crisis facing the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" target="_blank">NHS</a> and General PracticeI'm relieved the issue is now being recognised But I am dismayed that it has taken unrealistic manifesto commitments of the main political parties to highlight thisIt's infuriating to read about what will be happening after May what has been promised when you know some of the key commitments are totally unachievableThe policymakers must never have set foot in a practice or spoken to staff at the coalfaceI am concerned about the future number of doctors working in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> and I know this concern is shared by every GPA high proportion of GPs intend to retire in the next five years many taking early retirement because of the increasing demands Many others are going overseas Most worrying is young doctors not choosing to go into <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> All things considered it is not scaremongering to suggest that the Grangemouth situation is likely to become a much more common scenario in Scotland <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> is a difficult place to be at the minute The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" target="_blank">job</a> is tough it always has been but the last few years have seen workload and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stress_%28biology%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stress_%28biology%29" target="_blank">stress</a> levels increase greatlyPatients need to be seen and we want to see them quickly But it is important to highlight that the number of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patient</a> contacts we have in a day is high In each and every one of these <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">decision making</a> is involved Some of these decisions and judgements are straightforward â but many are not We are <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" target="_blank">trained</a> to screen for potentially more serious causes something that needs urgent attention referral or admission to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sleep" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sleep" target="_blank">Waking up</a> in the night worrying about <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> was something I expected to go away with experience â but it doesn'tEvery day sees us dealing with a vast array of problems â <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" target="_blank">medical</a> social <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychiatry" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psychiatry" target="_blank">psychiatric</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palliative_care" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palliative_care" target="_blank">palliative care</a> Someone new in the door every 10 minutes In that brief contact we are expected to take a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_history" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_history" target="_blank">history</a> and examine the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patient</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">make a decision</a> on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmaceutical_drug" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharmaceutical_drug" target="_blank">medications</a> and further investigation and precisely document it for the records and to protect us from litigation We cover home visits read large amounts of letters from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospitals</a> and have hundreds of results to look at daily each and every one needing a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">decision</a> After my 11hour working day I feel utterly drained physically and emotionallyThe GP contract renegotiated 10 years ago has resulted in many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_insurance" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_insurance" target="_blank">health benefits</a> but it means that a much bigger number of our appointments are dealing with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chronic_%28medicine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chronic_%28medicine%29" target="_blank">chronic</a> conditions such as <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diabetes_mellitus" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diabetes_mellitus" target="_blank">diabetes</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heart" target="_blank">heart</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Respiratory_disease" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Respiratory_disease" target="_blank">lung disease</a> rather than dealing with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acute_%28medicine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acute_%28medicine%29" target="_blank">acute illness</a> alone As a practice with a high proportion of elderly <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> we have many who have complex <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" target="_blank">medical</a> needs who need a lot of GP time We have to visit a lot of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> at home also immensely time consuming Our income has become targetdriven Unfortunately these targets change annually and increasingly are of questionable <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinical_trial" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clinical_trial" target="_blank">clinical</a> value This eats into time to spend directly with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> We have become used to hearing about pressure on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> staff and pressure on beds <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">Patients</a> are turned around very quickly and we see vastly increasing numbers of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> sent home from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> still needing a lot of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" target="_blank">medical care</a> This has placed a heavy burden on GP practices Keeping people out of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> is good â but only if it is adequately funded and staffedMissed appointments don't help availability for patientsSocial care is amassively underfunded If we refer a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patient</a> urgently that means staff have 28 days to respond â this is useless when faced with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acute_%28medicine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acute_%28medicine%29" target="_blank">acute</a> issues that arise with an elderly populationIt would be helpful if politicians didn't exacerbate the recruitment crisis and low morale which is sweeping through the profession Accepting demand will continue to rise proper engagement with frontline <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" target="_blank">NHS</a> staff to allow us to move forward with a sensible longterm plan would be much more helpful than making shortterm votewinning unachievable targetsSome genuine appreciation of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" target="_blank">job</a> we do and the pressures that we work under daily and understanding of the level of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" target="_blank">training</a> that we have completed would be a start  The idea that 8000 more GPs can be in post by 2020 is ridiculous since it takes 10 years to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" target="_blank">train</a> us from the point of starting university Should we be thinking about offering incentives for young doctors to enter <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> and to encourage <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medicine" target="_blank">medical</a> staff to stay in the UKThis could help boost GP numbers and would seem more sensible than promising sevenday opening when there are barely enough staff resources to cover current opening hoursIs it not better to learn to walk before you can run By writing this I am simply trying to raise awareness of some of the issues affecting <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> and some of the reasons behind them As GPs we currently deal with 90 per cent of contacts within the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" target="_blank">NHS</a> but receive only nine per cent of the budgetA <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" target="_blank">health service</a> in which <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> is failing is a worry for us allWe clearly need investment but it has to be the right kind of investment and as the providers of this service policy and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decision_making" target="_blank">decision</a> makers need to work with GPs to achieve the best outcomes for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patient" target="_blank">patients</a> in General PracticeI started <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_school" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medical_school" target="_blank">medical school</a> in 1992 and graduated in 1997 I completed my GP <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Training" target="_blank">training</a> in 2002Most of the things that attracted me to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> remain but overall the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Job_%28role%29" target="_blank">job</a> is depressingly unrecognisableI want to feel positive about the future of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General Practice</a> I do feel encouraged by the ongoing commitment of my colleagues in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/National_Health_Service" target="_blank">NHS</a> to deliver high quality care despite the everincreasing challenges we faceWhatever the election result let's hope GPs don't become a dying breed Try our quick news quiz below

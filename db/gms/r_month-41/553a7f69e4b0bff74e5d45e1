POLICE chiefs have warned a Loyalist <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" target="_blank">march</a> through the East End poses a very high threat of serious disorder and violenceThe Regimental Blues wants to hold a procession on Saturday May 9 starting on Garnock Street travelling along Royston Road High Street Gallowgate London Road finishing in Tullis streetIt is expected around 75 people will take part and that the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" target="_blank">march</a> will take an hourOn April 16 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Legislature" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Legislature" target="_blank">representatives</a> of the Regimental Blues Police Scotland and the city council met to discuss arrangements on the day and organisers were asked why they had chosen the routeThey said it had been specifically chosen to break down the barriers which are traditionally associated with certain areas of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/City" target="_blank">city</a> and their respective attachment to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Republican_Party_%28United_States%29" target="_blank">Republican</a> or Loyalist causesHowever police objected to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Highway" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Highway" target="_blank">route</a> of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" target="_blank">march</a> saying it posed a high risk of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_safety" target="_blank">public disorder</a> which could only be contained with a substantial police presenceThey asked for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marching_band" target="_blank">march</a> to take place from John Knox Street along High Street Gallowgate and London Road ending in Tullis StreetThe organiser said he would consider moving the assembly <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNN" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/CNN" target="_blank">point</a> to John Knox Street but was opposed to the suggested new routeAs the two sides failed to reach agreement the matter has been referred to the city council's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petition" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Petition" target="_blank">petitions</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Committee_of_Public_Safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Committee_of_Public_Safety" target="_blank">committee</a> for a final decisionA <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" target="_blank">report</a> to councillors says &quotPolice Scotland have made the following comments about the planned procession on May 9&quotShould this application be granted community tensions could rise and the threat of serious disorder and violence is very high&quotThis would not only impact significantly on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" target="_blank">local</a> residential and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> community but the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">general public</a> going about their daily <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Business" target="_blank">business</a> would also be severely affected&quotThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" target="_blank">report</a> adds &quotIt is considered there are clear risks that if this procession was allowed to proceed as currently proposed there would be a significant likelihood of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_safety" target="_blank">public disorder</a> with risks to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_safety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public_safety" target="_blank">public safety</a> and extended disruption to the life of the local community&quotCouncillors will be told <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marche" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marche" target="_blank">marches</a> by the Regimental Blues last <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" target="_blank">year</a> and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" target="_blank">year</a> before only passed without &quotsignificant incident&quot because of a substantial police presenceThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Explosion" target="_blank">report</a> says &quotIt is to be noted in these previous processions by the Regimental Blues there were no significant issues with the organiser and that the participants' behaviour complied with the police and code of conduct for processions&quotThe Regimental Blues have made a number of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a> statements about their views on groups which they regard as associated with Irish Republicanism&quotIn terms of general principles of freedom of speech they are entitled to do so&quotHowever it is feared there is a potential for a procession by the group along the planned <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Highway" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Highway" target="_blank">route</a> attracting significant opposition and protestMembers of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Public" target="_blank">public</a>

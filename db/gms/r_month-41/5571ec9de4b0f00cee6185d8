VETERAN <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Golf" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Golf" target="_blank">golf</a> commentator Peter Alliss has blasted rule changes that let top clubs admit women as membersThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BBC" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BBC" target="_blank">BBC's</a> Voice of Golf now 84 said the move to gender equality has âbered up the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">game</a>âAlliss claimed many women are against bringing malerun clubs into the 21st century â because they can no longer <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> for free or at reduced ratesHis outspoken remarks were yesterday condemned as âterribly outdatedâAlliss who will <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Girl_Guides" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Girl_Guides" target="_blank">guide</a> viewers through the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masters_Tournament" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Masters_Tournament" target="_blank">US Masters</a> from Friday insisted that changes to the rules since the Equality Act of 2010 had âcaused mayhemâ for many female playersHe said there had been a âhell of a rowâ since St Andrews and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_family" target="_blank">Royal</a> St George voted to admit women members while Troon and Muirfield who also hold the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Open_Championship" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Open_Championship" target="_blank">Open</a> are reviewing policyHe told the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radio_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radio_Times" target="_blank">Radio Times</a> âAll of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the &shyfacilities for freeâWhen I was at Muirfield a couple of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> ago talking to the ladies I said âWhat about this equality You must be happy' â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a> no' they said âWe come here and do what we like We can <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> and don't pay anything'âHe added âEquality for women â a few <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a> battled to get it and they have bered up the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostitution" target="_blank">game</a> for a lot of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">people</a>âAlliss an eighttime <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryder_Cup" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ryder_Cup" target="_blank">Ryder Cup</a> player who has commentated for 54 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> added âI'm told the Ladies Golf Union lost 150000 members since equality came in Hundreds of women have <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" target="_blank">left</a> clubs because they've gone from paying half fare to full fareâ Ladies Golf Union's finance director Sam Burton blamed the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Late-2000s_recession" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Late-2000s_recession" target="_blank">recession</a> for a drop of 30000 members in four <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> from 189000 in 2010She said âI wouldn't dream of joining a club where women had fewer rights than men Neither would my friendsâShe said women didn't <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> for free on their husbands' memberships at &shymainstream clubs adding âI can't agree with what he's saying it's a terribly outdated viewâAlliss insisted he was not a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dinosaur" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dinosaur" target="_blank">dinosaur</a> saying âI've moved very well with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> But there are certain standards that have been there foreverâBut his days at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/BBC"

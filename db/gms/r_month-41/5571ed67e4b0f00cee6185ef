visibility But in terms of using the rescue helicopters they were very restricted because the cloud was down to 100metres âIt was way down on the hill particularly the area where the crash site is â that was over 700metresâThey took the mountain rescue guys as high as they possibly could and dropped them on the hill to walk up from there The problem with a plane crash is a plane is going quite fast If you are going at 60mph on the road a plane will go at 100mph â it's a fair impact at that kind of speedâAviation expert <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_I_of_Scotland"

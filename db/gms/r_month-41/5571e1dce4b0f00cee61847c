title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" target="_blank">Alan</a> O'Donnell tried to pour bleach into her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth" target="_blank">mouth</a> and threatened her with a knifeLast night she said âI loved him I trusted him and he beat me within an inch of my life and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" target="_blank">left</a> me lying on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floor" target="_blank">floor</a> for dead Tell me â where is the justiceâThe mum of four was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" target="_blank">left</a> with black eyes and horrifying bruising She says drunken O'Donnell â who had a 14yearold with him â flicked <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cigarette" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cigarette" target="_blank">cigarette</a> ash on her then casually <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walked</a> awayO'Donnell 46 had faced a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a> charge but was convicted of the lesser charge of assault and jailed for three yearsLorraine blasted the justice <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/9-1-1" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/9-1-1" target="_blank">system</a> for the lenient sentence handed out at the High Court in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> earlier this month O'Donnell had a previous conviction for a domestic breach of the peaceLorraine 45 from Yoker <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> says he was high on booze and diazepam when he attacked herShe said âThat was the worst night of my life and it <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" target="_blank">left</a> me scared to look in a mirror or even leave the house on my ownâI've begged the council to move me from this house but they won't and every day I have to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walk</a> into my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kitchen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kitchen" target="_blank">kitchen</a> where I lay on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floor" target="_blank">floor</a> for three hours covered in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood" target="_blank">blood</a> and bleach begging for my lifeâAfter he was arrested he was given bail and allowed to live just around the corner so every waking moment I was terrified he would come back to get meâI couldn't work I nearly lost everything and to think he has been given only three years in prison makes me sick â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" target="_blank">Alan</a> was my husband and someone I trusted who attacked me beat me kicked me punched me held me down and tried to pour bleach in my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth" target="_blank">mouth</a> then  threatened me with a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knife" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knife" target="_blank">knife</a> â but he will probably be living back around the corner in 18 months âAfter the attack I discovered that my son was going to bed with a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knife" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knife" target="_blank">knife</a> under his pillow to protect us in case <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" target="_blank">Alan</a> came backâ The attack on Lorraine came after she had stayed in for a night by herself watching soaps before going to bed earlyShe recalls she <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" target="_blank">left</a> her phone downstairs to charge and claims she was unaware of the hundreds of messages and incoming calls from O'Donnell telling her she was disrespecting him by ignoring him and â she claims â even threatening her lifeLorraine was asleep in bed when O'Donnell of Drumchapel <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> arrived by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taxicab" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taxicab" target="_blank">taxi</a> early in the morning and claims he demanded she have a whisky with himShe said â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" target="_blank">Alan</a> was helping to look after a 14yearold so I was getting an early night but at 445am I heard him outside&quotWhen I answered the door he was really drunk and then showed me an empty pack of diazepam pills that he said he had takenâIt was 5am I asked him what he thought he was doing dragging a 14yearold out but he demanded I have a whisky with himâWhen I said I was going to bed he refused and we ended up in the living room where he knocked me on to the couch and wouldn't let me get upâHe went berserk and grabbed me by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hair" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hair" target="_blank">hair</a> pulled me into the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kitchen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kitchen" target="_blank">kitchen</a> and then ripped off my pyjama top so I was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Left-wing_politics" target="_blank">left</a> on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Floor" target="_blank">floor</a> wearing only my knickersâHe started kicking and punching my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" target="_blank">head</a> and in an attempt to get away I grabbed his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg_drop" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Leg_drop" target="_blank">leg</a> and he fell but then suddenly he had a rolling pin out of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kitchen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kitchen" target="_blank">kitchen</a> drawer and started hitting me on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Head" target="_blank">head</a> âI could feel the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bodyguard" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bodyguard" target="_blank">heavy</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood" target="_blank">wood</a> bouncing off the bones of my skull then he picked up a grater and held it to my face threatening to tear it down the side of my faceâI screamed and begged him to stop but he then pinned me down with his knees on my shouldersâHolding a bottle of bleach he started trying to open my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth" target="_blank">mouth</a> and it ran all over my face neck and chest as I tried to fight him offâThen he grabbed a large kitchen knife and turned to the 14yearold and asked him if he should do it and I thought I was deadâHe then calmed down and got up smoked a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cigarette" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cigarette" target="_blank">cigarette</a> and then flicked it on to my chest before <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walking</a> out like it was nothingâLorraine contacted her eldest son who called police She says she doesn't recognise O'Donnell as the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" target="_blank">man</a> she once lovedThe couple who had briefly dated as teenagers struck up a romance again after meeting in the street three years agoThe lovedup pair tied the knot a year later in June 2013 But Lorraine claims that within weeks of their wedding she saw a different side to O'Donnell She said â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" target="_blank">Alan</a> was so kind caring and attentive and he was desperate for us to get marriedâWithin weeks of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Walking" target="_blank">walking</a> down the aisle he became dark really controlling and jealousâHe was always trying to give me food even if I wasn't hungry and I began to feel like he was trying to keep me by making me fat so other men wouldn't find me attractiveâI started work a month after we married but he hated me going and would refuse to babysit the kidsâOnce we were married <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alan_Alda" target="_blank">Alan</a> kept his home and I kept mine and saved up every penny we had so we could get a house together âBut whenever he was away from me he would text me really strange demonic things about the  Antichrist and when I confronted him he just passed it off as a jokeâ She believes he was using diazepam and booze when he was away from herLorraine said âIn the end he was a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human" target="_blank">person</a> who kept the extent of his problems hidden very well and I paid the price for loving himâSentencing him judge Lady Rae told him âNo remorse has been shown for what happenedâ

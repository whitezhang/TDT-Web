THE police thought <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> Toner had fled justiceHis family feared he was dead they were rightThe 34yearold businessman was reported <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" target="_blank">missing</a> on June 29 2004 just weeks before he was due to appear on cocaine smuggling chargesHis older brother James won't forget the date it is tattooed on to the inside of his wrist &quotMartin went <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" target="_blank">missing</a> on June 29 and he died on June 29&quotInitially it was a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" target="_blank">missing person</a> inquiry&quotThe police were looking in cupboards and under beds and in car boots &quotAnd we were telling them 'This is serious <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> would not do this' &quotThey were not taking it seriously at all&quotIt was voiced to us that one of the lines they had to look at was that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> had run away because of his drug trial that was coming up&quotTwo weeks later at one in the morning of July 13 a farmer called John Baxter was working in a field near Langbank in Renfrewshire when the headlights of his tractor lit up something under a hedgeIt was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> Toner The fatheroftwo had been stabbed in the head neck and body and his throat had been slitEven before the body was identified James Toner knew it was his brother He said &quotWhen he went <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Missing_person" target="_blank">missing</a> my initial instinct was that something was wrong&quotAs time went on I know that we probably would not be getting <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> back alive Part of me was hoping he had run away but realistically I was expecting the worst&quotJames didn't just know his brother was dead He also thought the Crown had prosecuted the right man a former policeman called Doug Fleming and one of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> Toner's coaccused at the coming drugs trialOn Tuesday a jury was not so sure Eleven years after the killing 15 men and women found a murder charge against Mr Fleming 50 not proven The case against another man John McDonald 57 was deserted earlier in the trialThe jury did not know that Mr Fleming had had previous runins with the law Charges he had conspired with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> Toner to import drugs direct from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbia_Records" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Columbia_Records" target="_blank">Columbia</a> had also been found not proven in 2008But Fleming left Central Scotland Police in 1988 After then he found himself arrested in Spain on drugs chargesBy the time of the killing he was formally a property developer with common business interests with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> TonerJames Toner who was a social worker in 2004 knew thisIn testimony at the High Court in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> James said that Mr Fleming had claimed he had taken <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> to Langbank  where Mr Fleming lived  to split up &pound100000 he had hidden in a field thereMr Fleming according to James Toner had one &pound10000 bundle and given <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> another nine Mr Fleming however denied this conversation ever took placeJames now 50 he says those days in 2004 were completely unrealSpeaking to the Evening Times he said &quotI have spoken to other people who have experienced something similar and they all say the same thing Even when you say the words 'My brother has been murdered' it doesn't sound right It was like a cartoon &quotNone of it felt real&quotHe knows <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> broke the law James said &quotMartin was up to all sorts&quotHe was not a bad guy His past was flowery&quotHe had been in prison but he was not a bad person He would not have done that to anybody and left them in a field like that&quotHe was fit and he could look after himself His temper was shorter than mine But he was not a stereotypical drug dealer who used violence as part of his work&quotGangster is a word that gets used When I think 'gangster' I think <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Capone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Capone" target="_blank">Al Capone</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> was not <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Capone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Al_Capone" target="_blank">Al Capone</a>&quotThe two boys were close Too close sometimes The five year difference had not stopped a rivalry &quotSometimes our house was like a western There were two guys like John Wayne and Victor Victor McLaglen&quotMy mammy brought the two of us up when my father died when I was just 10 That was in South Africa He took her there in '72 and we came back around '75 My mum tells me were back within two weeks&quotAgnes Toner mother to James and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> lost her husband when he was 33 and her second son when he was 34James too brought her worries After <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> died James he admits suffered a crisis He &quotran away&quot  his words  to India where was he first jailed and then held on legal limbo for four years on trumpedup drugs chargesHis case became international news after Prime Minister David Cameron intervenedBack in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> for two years James has put that behind him He has he says learned to forgive himself and stop think of himself as a victim The victim <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> his widow an their two childrenHe said &quotNobody deserves to die that way and nobody deserves to be found by a farmer in a field two weeks after they've died&quotAs soon as Martin's was found the police took the case very seriously &quotI think for them a murder is a murder no buts&quot James saidSo much has happened in the decade since the killing Martin's eldest has grown up His then baby is now at secondary schoolJames tries to remember his brother as he was Spared the sight of Martin's remains he always worried about Mr Baxter the farmer who found them &quotIf the police did not want us to see <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> what did that poor man see&quot he saidHe added &quotI used to go sit where <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aston_Martin" target="_blank">Martin</a> was found There is a cracking view It a lovely spot Once I met the farmer He said he had been thinking about me since the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doris_Day" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doris_Day" target="_blank">day</a> he saw me on TV ten years ago&quotHe could tell me not to worry he had not seen anything All he saw was Martin's back in the hedge&quotNow I find that spot more comforting than Martin's grave in Linn Park&quotAfter my years in India there is a bit of the Buddhist in me know so I am not big on the grave thing I believe his energy is out there and with me all the time&quotIt was Martin's birthday on the last Friday of the trial and he would have been 45&quotHe was a family man who was dedicated to his wife and his two kids Everything he did he did to provide for them He had been with his wife since he was 15 He was a loyal loyal person&quotI have let all my anger go But a human being had his life taken away from him an in unnatural way&quot

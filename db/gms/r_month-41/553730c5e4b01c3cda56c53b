EVIDENCE has emerged of a wartime blunder that resulted in millions of pounds of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russian</a> bullion supposedly bound for America being lost in the ClydeThe gold and silver bars had been loaded in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murmansk" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murmansk" target="_blank">Murmansk</a> onto a former Irish Sea ferry converted into a battle cruiser with her superstructure stripped taking part in the last of the notorious Qseries of Arctic ConvoysThe bullion was to pay the Americans for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coat_of_arms" target="_blank">arms</a> shipped to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russia</a> during one of the most crucial stages of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_I" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/World_War_I" target="_blank">World War</a> IIThe former ferry HMS Ulster Queen arrived in Greenock in November 1942 after 13 days at sea and two ships sunk by German UboatsBut as a delicate operation began to transfer the cases of treasure onto a waiting boat one slipped and fell into the muddy watersSuch a veil of secrecy existed over the whole operation it is not known if it was ever recoveredIn fact the incident has only come to light at all thanks to a secret diary kept by one of the Ulster Queen's engineers and now revealed by his daughter for the first time in a new bookEdinburgh man Leonard H Thomas served on the Ulster Queen on four convoys to and from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murmansk" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murmansk" target="_blank">Murmansk</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arkhangelsk" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Arkhangelsk" target="_blank">Archangel</a> in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russia</a>'s extreme northwestThomas had got into the habit of keeping copious notes and sketches during his prewar role as a crewman on the research ship RRS Discovery II in the Southern OceanHe had joined the Discovery as a 17yearold in his native PortsmouthHe continued his writings on the Convoys  but aware that should any of his diaries be discovered he would be in serious trouble he wrote in code and secreted them wellBefore he died in 2000 aged 88 he transcribed some of them into four A4 journals which his daughter Leona Thomas has now edited into a bookLeona 61 a retired school teacher said today âThe story about the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russian</a> bullion is fascinating It must be documented somewhere but I have never been able to find out what happened afterwardsâAccording to her father's notes there had been âa peculiar silence all through the shipâ as she was loaded in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russia</a> Noone was allowed on deck noone was allowed along the alleyways for'ard of the engine room and noone off the mess decks unless they were on watch The reasons soon became clearThomas recorded âNo scuttles [were] allowed to be opened but someone got a gleek out and saw mighty big steam locomotives smothered in soldiers up and down the cleared area of the track hundreds of them all with rifles and many with Tommy gunsâOur guards lined the deck we later heard either side of a small derrick which handled the paravanes [mine detectors] A huge dark <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wagon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wagon" target="_blank">wagon</a> was coaxed nudged and jogged until the derrick's fall was hanging vertically and a rope net was placed on the ground âOfficers approached the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wagon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wagon" target="_blank">wagon</a> and examined locks and bolts [with] armed troops literally surrounding it Then began the laborious manual exercise of [unloading] what looked like <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ammunition" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ammunition" target="_blank">ammunition</a> boxes which required two men to lift âSurely this wasn't small arms <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ammunition" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ammunition" target="_blank">ammunition</a> Not with our own guards and hundreds of troops watching it loaded into us It certainly was not It was bullionâTwo boxes were enough to load the sling and up they went deposited on our deck from where each one was slid and lowered down into the âB Gun' magazine never out of sight of at least one officerâThis was the arrangement so that the millions could be spent in the USA to arm the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russians" target="_blank">Russians</a>âOnce back in the Clyde after âa fast run down the Minchesâ calamity was to come howeverThomas wrote âIt was very late when we saw the welcoming but shaded lights of the Boom Control vessels hauling left and right to usher us through the widening but regulated aperture and suddenly the serenity of approaching a hallowed anchorage and being met by a small but important armada and a lighterâFor the next hour it was cloakanddagger stuff again noone allowed on the upper deck for'ard of the Wardroom or on the working alleyways We heard that troops and all sorts were organised to receive the bullion from where it had been manhandled onto the upper deck âThe paravane derrick was reeved [threaded] and a wire was taken with snatch blocks to a winch âThe first two boxes were slung with a hemp ropesling âIn the shaded lights were many officials officers men in good suits bayonets torches clipboards tarpaulins surreptitious smokers but nary an onlookerâOur Captain anxiously peered over the port wing of the bridge his nose barely over the canvas dodger to observe the last rites of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia" target="_blank">Russian</a> bullion âAnd then it happened The first boxes two in number were being hauled toward the lighter and who knows what happened but one slipped and fell with a resounding thump and a splash into the ClydeâI was told on good authority that it was nothing so much as resembling a H M Bateman cartoon Needless to say all were to blame according to what was imparted as a result of this shocking affair âThe rest was capably transferred to a lighter various bits of paper signed exchanged and pocketed and a tug chuffed up to pull the lighter clearâWritten in the diaries left for Leona her dad said âI was thankful to keep all these years the actual daily scroll of some of the harrowing times I found myself in especially the runs in the arctic waters so fraught with danger both manmade and that of natureâLeona said of the gold âWho knows it may still be thereââ¢ Through Ice and Fire A <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Russia"

believe it The driver was slumped over the wheel and he looked out coldâThe lorry wasn't going very fast but I think the hedges stopped it coming through the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House" target="_blank">houses</a> âYou could hear the engine of the truck coming down but it wasn't going at any speedâEven still there was a split second when I thought it was coming straight for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Lords"

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_service" target="_blank">military service</a> said it was âvery fittingâ that Shaun's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Funeral" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Funeral" target="_blank">funeral</a> was held at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service"

Michele paid tribute to her son following his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">death</a> In a moving <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poetry" target="_blank">poem</a> from his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grandparent" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grandparent" target="_blank">grandma</a> Christine the service heard the 22yearold described as a âwonderful loving and cheeky chappie who made the <a

on his ownâ His coffin draped with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Union_Flag" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Union_Flag" target="_blank">British Flag</a> left the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> to a guard of honour made up of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comrade" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comrade" target="_blank">comrades</a> from the 1st Battalion of The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Regiment_of_Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Royal_Regiment_of_Scotland" target="_blank">Royal Regiment of Scotland</a> who gave him a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/21-gun_salute" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/21-gun_salute" target="_blank">gun salute</a> Speaking after the service Reverend <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tina_Turner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tina_Turner" target="_blank">Turner</a> said âShaun would have been to this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a> a number of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> over the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> because <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Company_%28military_unit%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Company_%28military_unit%29" target="_blank">companies</a> of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Army" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/French_Army" target="_blank">army</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_parade" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Military_parade" target="_blank">parade</a> down from the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barracks" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Barracks" target="_blank">barracks</a> whenever they're deployed somewhereâHe would also have been here for his homecoming service when he returned from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan" target="_blank">Afghanistan</a> so it was very fitting to have it here todayâOver the last couple of weeks obviously his family and the local community have been really saddened and shocked by this tragedy of somebody being <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> at such a young ageâThere were so many <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_People" target="_blank">people</a> here today and that's a good testimony to how well thought of he was and how much he was loved There were around 650 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_People" target="_blank">people</a> here todayâBut I think this was a real positive gathering of all those <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_People" target="_blank">people</a> on a lovely sunny morning to give thank for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game" target="_blank">life</a> Shaun lived in his short number of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a>â She added âAll the different elements came together well and his sister <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jade" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jade" target="_blank">Jade</a> speaking and his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a> They were worried they would breakdown but I think they did it very well todayâThey were quite composed when it came to the day because they've been imagining it for a couple of weeks now But when it came to it they really did him proudâShaun's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Religious_Society_of_Friends" target="_blank">friends</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> lined the quiet country road outside the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Church_service" target="_blank">church</a>

Edinburghborn soldierHe said described Shaun as a âhighly capable experienced and professional young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soldier" target="_blank">soldier</a>â who had served just over three <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Millennium" target="_blank">years</a> with the first battalionColquhoun said âHe proved himself on demanding combat operations in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan"

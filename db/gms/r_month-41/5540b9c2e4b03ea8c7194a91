href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_Who" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Doctor_Who" target="_blank">doctor</a> by day has had to use her medical skills during rehearsals However the few instances she has have involved fellow Cathkin High <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pupil" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pupil" target="_blank">pupil</a> KellyRachel explained âDuring <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Side_Story" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/West_Side_Story" target="_blank">West Side Story</a> she had a huge asthma attack following one of the <a

href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/A_Chorus_Line" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/A_Chorus_Line" target="_blank">Chorus Line</a> I had to drive her to the hospital after a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Performance_art" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Performance_art" target="_blank">performance</a> and it turned out she had kidney stones I'd say she's probably been the most prolific user of my somewhat limited medical talents as they were thenâ Even without any health scares they both agree that this show is one of the their most interesting and exciting projects to date The risqu&eacute <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_theatre" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_theatre" target="_blank">musical comedy</a> tells the story of a

part yetAnnemerle or âShy' is na&iumlve and as her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nickname" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nickname" target="_blank">nickname</a> suggests withdrawn However she's also headstrong and there's a darker <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-side_and_B-side" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-side_and_B-side" target="_blank">side</a> to the character which has set this apart from other roles Kelly has tackled âMiss Mona the head of the whorehouse gives her the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nickname" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nickname" target="_blank">nickname</a> Shy She's new to everything and kind of ditsy she's a bit like Dorothy in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_film%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Wizard_of_Oz_%281939_film%29" target="_blank">Wizard of Oz</a> There's that but there's a darker <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-side_and_B-side" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-side_and_B-side" target="_blank">side</a> to playing her as well  she leaves home because she's being abused by her dad It's challenging and a great part to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a>âIn past shows I've tended to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> the sexy Latin type but when I first got in to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acting" target="_blank">acting</a> I wanted to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Play_%28theatre%29" target="_blank">play</a> darker roles so this is kind of me going back to my rootsâRachel has also starred in the cast of many GMT shows

target="_blank">Threepenny Opera</a> Although she loves preforming being on the production team allows Rachel to be involved despite her hectic <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Working_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Working_%28musical%29" target="_blank">work</a> schedule âIt's easier to fit in with my schedule  especially producing which is much less of a time commitment  and I do really enjoy it I think that might just be partly because it gives me an outlet for my OCD organisational skills that isn't <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Working_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Working_%28musical%29" target="_blank">work</a> I really do miss performing though and I'm excited at the prospect of getting back on the bandwagon at some point when my shifts are less chaoticâAnd both ladies are convinced that even if you're not an avid <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_theatre" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_theatre" target="_blank">musical theatre</a> fan this is a show anyone will be able to enjoyRachel said âIt's unusual to have a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_theatre" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_theatre" target="_blank">musical</a> that is in one particular style in this case <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Country_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Country_music" target="_blank">country</a> and I'm actually finding that surprisingly fun to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Working_%28musical%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Working_%28musical%29" target="_blank">work</a> with In particular it means that our <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musician" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musician" target="_blank">musicians</a> can really be tailored to that style they <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soundtrack" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soundtrack" target="_blank">sound</a> like a proper honkeytonk <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Musical_ensemble" target="_blank">band</a>âKelly added âThe cast in the show in phenomenal I think with this show there's more a story It can get quite emotional and you feel like you really get to know the characters I think everyone who goes to see it will enjoy itâThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Best_Little_Whorehouse_in_Texas"

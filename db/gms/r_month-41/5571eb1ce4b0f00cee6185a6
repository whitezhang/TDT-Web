THE mum of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murdered</a> teenager Kriss Donald yelled with delight today as one of his racist killers had his time behind bars increasedDaanish Zahid returned to the High Court in Glasgow  more than a decade after he was jailed for life for the crime that shocked ScotlandZahid was hauled back into the dock after lying to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" target="_blank">appeal</a> judges to try and free Imran âBaldyâ Shahid  the ringleader of the mob who adducted and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> Kriss in 2004The 31yearold had insisted Shahid was âinnocentâ and that another Glasgowbased Asian gang was behind the gruesome murderZahid claimed he had been threatened into silence and then revealed a string of texts supposedly naming the âreal killersâBut judges blasted the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence" target="_blank">evidence</a>  while also throwing out Shahid's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" target="_blank">appeal</a>  before ordering a largescale probe into the liesIt lead to Zahid today being jailed for another six years after he admitted attempting to defeat the ends of justiceKriss' emotional mum Angela was also in court to see again one of her son's killers and screamed âyesâ as the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sentence_%28law%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sentence_%28law%29" target="_blank">sentence</a> was passedAngela  who also heard claims he was now âsorryâ for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a>  then shouted âHope you die in jailâZahid refused to look at the mum and her other friends and family as he was lead to the cellsThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sentence_%28law%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sentence_%28law%29" target="_blank">sentence</a> will only begin once Zahid serves the minimum 17 years imposed for the killingIt means it could be as late as 2027 before he is freed Angela later made no comment as she left in a taxi after the hearingKriss was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murdered</a> in March 2004 after being abducted by the racist mob in the city's PollokshieldsImran Shahid was seeking revenge after earlier being assaulted  despite the 15 yearold being totally blamelessThe 15yearold  snatched because he was white  was stabbed doused in petrol and then burned near to Celtic's then training ground in Glasgow's east endImran Shahid was jailed for a minimum 25 years after he was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conviction" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conviction" target="_blank">convicted</a> in 2006His brother Zeeshan and Mohammed Mushtaq were also jailed for life Daanish Zahid had been found guilty at a separate trialImran Shahid was later granted an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" target="_blank">appeal</a> in 2011 after apparently fresh evidence from Zahid had emergedIn a bid to clear the thug Zahid was prepared to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Testimony" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Testimony" target="_blank">testify</a> that he had been at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a> as an âunwilling accompliceâ but that it had been committed by another Asian gangHe claimed the other mob had threatened him into pinning the blame on ShahidProsecutor Iain McSporran today explained âHe gave <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence" target="_blank">evidence</a> on oath confirming his position as to who had really <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> Kriss Donald âImran Shahid was not involved and that he had been so frightened in the aftermath of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a> that he made notes on a phoneidentifying the killersâHe claimed that in 2008 he realised it was wrong for an innocent man to have been jailed for a crime he had not committedâSo he arranged for the phone he had concealed to be handed to solicitors for that manâIn one of the texts Zahid states another man âkidnapped and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murdered</a>â KrissZahid said he drove the car âagainst his willâ and that if he was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> himself then this gang were responsibleHe then states one the gang threatened to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a> him â20 minutes agoâ adding âI believe them because I saw them kill Kriss 2 and a half hours agoâMr McSporran described this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence" target="_blank">evidence</a> as a âculmination of a pretenceâ over a period of years and that it involved an âinherent lack of credibilityâJudges rejected the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Appeal" target="_blank">appeal</a> later branding the lies âan elaborate and sophisticated attempt to deceive the courtâThe comments sparked a lengthy <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" target="_blank">investigation</a> which lead to Zahid being charged last JuneHis lawyer today said Zahid had always wanted to plead guilty to the lies to spare the family of Kriss going through another <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trial" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trial" target="_blank">trial</a> Susan Duff defending then went on âAt the age of 31 he can see the pain and distress he caused the Donald familyâThey have to live with that every day He did not want to add to their distressâHe has asked me to convey his deep sorrow and regretâAt that comment Angela Donald  sitting in the public benches  was heard to say âNo chanceâLord Kinclaven said this latest jail term would have been nine years but for the guilty pleaThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" target="_blank">judge</a> said âYou have accepted responsibility for an extremely serious offence against our system of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" target="_blank">justice</a> over a period of yearsâ Try our quick news quiz below

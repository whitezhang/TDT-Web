 THE fatal accident inquiry into the Glasgow bin <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truck" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truck" target="_blank">lorry</a> crash will look at driver's medical background and his fitness to hold a licence it has been revealedA sheriff will also consider the technical aspects of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> itself and whether it was appropriate for it to take the route it did through Glasgow city centre just before ChristmasAnd a video of the route of the of the refuse lorry  shot from the same height as the cab in the aftermath of the carnage  will be shown to the inquiryA preliminary hearing for the fatal accident inquiry took place today at Glasgow Sheriff Court where the probe is due to start on July 22 exactly seven months after the tragedyHowever lawyers acting for some of the victims indicated the inquiry may well be delayed in order to give them more time to examine expert reportsThe outofcontrol <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truck" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truck" target="_blank">lorry</a> driven by 58yearold Harry Clarke ploughed into <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedestrian" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pedestrian" target="_blank">pedestrians</a> on December 22 on Glasgow's Queen Street killing six including three members of the same familyIt later emerged Clarke who spoke of his anguish to the Daily Record was unconscious at the wheel Erin McQuade 18 her grandparents Jack Sweeney 68 and his 69yearold wife Lorraine all from Dumbarton died in the incident Stephenie Tait 29 and Jacqueline Morton 51 both from Glasgow and Gillian Ewing 52 from Edinburgh were also killed when the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truck" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truck" target="_blank">truck</a> mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium HotelSheriff Principal Craig Scott who will hear the FAI said it will set out to &quotestablish the circumstances relating to the tragic deaths&quot of the six victimsScotland's second most senior law officer Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC who will lead the inquiry said it will cover three main areasShe said &quotThe issues fall into three categories which are firstly around the driver of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> his medical background his fitness to hold the licence his employment record and training&quotSecondly the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> itself and the technical aspects if there could have been any measures or interventions to have brought that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> to a controlled stop&quotAnd thirdly the safety of the refuse collection route taken by the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motor_vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Motor_vehicle" target="_blank">motor vehicle</a> In relation to that I would intend to explore not just the route but the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" target="_blank">time</a> of week and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" target="_blank">time</a> of year and assess the appropriateness of that route at that time of year&quotShe added &quotThe Crown's position is that I anticipate being ready to conduct the inquiry on the dates being given and that it can be concluded within the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" target="_blank">time</a> allocated&quotThe Solicitor General said arrangements will be made for people involved in the FAI to view the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> before the inquiry starts while during the FAI it will be brought to a suitable place close to the courtShe has also requested that a film of the route from the level of the driver be madeLawyers for the families Glasgow City Council DVLA and the driver were also at the hearing as were some relatives of those who diedSome of the lawyers said they could not indicate whether they will be ready by July 22 after the court heard some material and expert reports are not yet available from the CrownThat could lead to a delay in the inquiry and Sheriff Principal Scott said &quotI have to stress it would be very unfortunate for the inquiry not to proceed on the appointed date&quotThe Crown have been expeditious in instigating the inquiry into the events of 22 December and the court has been equally expeditious in making considerable arrangements to accommodate the inquiry&quotWere the inquiry to be put off it's difficult at this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time" target="_blank">stage</a> to envisage when it might be accommodated so really where possible the inquiry should proceed on 22 July&quotA further preliminary hearing has been set for May 18

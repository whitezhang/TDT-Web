 MASTER ice cream maker <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" target="_blank">Owen</a> Hazel has become a bit of a celebrity on the streets of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shanghai" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shanghai" target="_blank">Shanghai</a>â¦and it's all thanks to our Golden Cone <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" target="_blank">Awards</a>  Since his cafe â Jannettas at St Andrews â was named best ice cream parlour in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> last year <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/China" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/China" target="_blank">Chinese</a> tourists have been queuing up to be pictured with our gleaming trophy So much so <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" target="_blank">Owen</a> is now a wellkent face on Asian social mediaHe said âThey always want me in the picture too It's not usually my cup of tea to be the centre of attention and it's a bit strange to feel that I might be a minor celebrity in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shanghai" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shanghai" target="_blank">Shanghai</a> but I do love itâJannettas has been a St Andrews institution for more than 100 years but winning the coveted Golden Cone <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" target="_blank">Award</a> last year was like a sprinkle of magic on the South Street cafe and the Hazel family who own itHundreds of their customers nominated the parlour in our contest â which is sponsored by Waverley Bakery â spelling out just why they love JannettasAnd a visit from a judging panel was enough to make sure they had the competition lickedNow the Golden Cone is up for grabs again as we launch this year's search for the best cafe in the landBut for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" target="_blank">Owen</a> the memory of learning they had won is still as fresh as this morning's batch of vanillaHe said âI was sitting in my van in the car park of the Rufflets Hotel when the call came in It was a really emotional momentâWe'd been too scared to think that we might actually <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winnipeg" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winnipeg" target="_blank">win</a>âOwen's wife Nicola whose great grandad set up the business in 1908 said she can't even do her shopping without people congratulating herShe said âI'd be walking round Morrisons and people would come up to tell me well doneâ Jannetta's has just reopened after a threemonth refurbishment and the parlour is now much bigger with 54 different <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ice_cream" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ice_cream" target="_blank">ice cream</a> flavours to choose fromOwen said âWe've become even more creative and we've been trying out savoury versionsâSo we've got wasabi <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ice_cream" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ice_cream" target="_blank">ice cream</a> strawberry and balsamic vinegar and raspberry with red pepperâSince winning the Golden Cone Jannettas has attracted some celebrity fans including footballerturnedpundit Jamie Rednapp who stopped by for a cone on his way to the Alfred Dunhill golf championshipBut it's the reaction of ordinary customers that has meant the most to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buck_Owens" target="_blank">Owen</a> and his teamHe said âWe'd just won the trophy when a customer came in to congratulate us He was telling his wee boy that this was the best ice cream parlour in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> âBut the wee boy said âNo it isn't Aunty Betty's in Stonehaven is much better' I had to laugh âI'm sure there's a wee boy standing outside Aunt Betty's saying Jannettas is the best At least I hope there isâNadia Millar the managing director of Golden Cone sponsor Waverley Bakery can't wait for this year's competitionShe grew up in the business helping her dad Alessandro run ice cream vans in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a>'s east end but she now heads <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland's</a> only maker of traditional cones and wafersNadia said âThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" target="_blank">award</a> really can benefit those involved as can be clearly seen from the phenomenal success enjoyed by both our previous winners â Visocchi's of Broughty Ferry in 2013 and Jannettas of St Andrews last yearâThis year's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Award"

WHEN <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adolescence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adolescence" target="_blank">teenager</a> Alex Tait â¨carried her books to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> she couldn't understand how her bag seemed so much heavier than her classmates' bagsShe also found sitting on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> chairs more uncomfortable than any of her friendsAnd she also struggled to understand how she was much less agile at PEBut it was during a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> gym <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dallas_%28TV_series%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dallas_%28TV_series%29" target="_blank">lesson</a> that a friend noticed what she suspected was a curve in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Alex</a>'s <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" target="_blank">spine</a> Tests revealed the active student had scoliosis and doctors broke the news she would need major <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> to stop her back from twisting â¨any further out of shapeNow just eight months on from the operation <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Alex</a> is not only walking tall she is set to take part in the Great <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" target="_blank">Women</a>'s 10km to raise money for the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> that helped her before heading to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/United_States" target="_blank">America</a> for a summer â¨of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Education" target="_blank">teaching</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sport" target="_blank">sport</a> to childrenAlex 18 of Murrayfield <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> said âWhen I look back now I can't believe I didn't realise earlier that something was wrong I had suffered back ache for quite a while and carrying my schoolbag always made my back sore as did sitting on chairs with no backBut I just got used to the pain I didn't want to moan all the time so didn't mention itâThen in gym one day my friend Ali said she thought one side of my back was higher than the other Her older sister had suffered from scoliosis so she knew what she was talking aboutâI went home and showed my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mother" target="_blank">mum</a> who â¨is a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nurse" target="_blank">nurse</a> When she looked she said my friend was rightâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Alex</a> attended the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edinburgh" target="_blank">Edinburgh</a> where <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Combat_medic" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Combat_medic" target="_blank">medics</a> found three curves in her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" target="_blank">spine</a> with the worst of the twists bordering on severeShe was told she needed spinal fusion <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> where <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgeon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgeon" target="_blank">surgeons</a> would join together bones in her â¨back to straighten her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" target="_blank">spine</a> She was warned there was a danger the operation could leave her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paralysis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paralysis" target="_blank">paralysed</a> But she said the benefits of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> outweighed the riskShe said âWhen I first attended the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hospital" target="_blank">hospital</a> I was told the most serious of the curves was twisting at an angle of 47 degrees â when normal is around 10 degrees At first the doctors said they would monitor what was happening and the first few <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Times" target="_blank">times</a> I went for appointments my back didn't <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menopause" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menopause" target="_blank">change</a> muchâBut then in just a few months my back started to â¨get much sorer and an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/X-ray" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/X-ray" target="_blank">Xray</a> showed the curve had changed to 54 degreesâAs her condition worsened <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Alex</a> started to feel selfconscious about her appearanceShe said âI'm not someone who normally worries too much about what other people think but I had bought a beautiful dress with a low back for a party at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/School" target="_blank">school</a> and when the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" target="_blank">day</a> of the dance came I didn't wear itâEveryone knew I needed an operation to straighten my back and I just <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felt" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felt" target="_blank">felt</a> everyone would be looking so I wore something elseâ<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alex_Harvey_%28musician%29" target="_blank">Alex</a> remembers little about the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" target="_blank">day</a> she had the fivehour <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> but she does remember being worried that she couldn't feel any <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pain" target="_blank">pain</a> when she woke up She said âI tried not to think about what could go wrong When I woke up I was a bit worried that my back <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felt" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felt" target="_blank">felt</a> just really numb â until I knew that was normalâI was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anxiety" target="_blank">anxious</a> about getting up and walking in case I couldn't But the physios get you up as quickly as possible and by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Days_of_our_Lives" target="_blank">day</a> five they had me going up and down stairsâThe exercises she was given to help her recover from the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> introduced Alex to a whole new world of fitness She started to set herself fitness targets including signing up to the run the Great <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" target="_blank">Women</a>'s 10kmAnd now just eight months after the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> she has never <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felt" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Felt" target="_blank">felt</a> fitterAlex who deferred starting <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" target="_blank">university</a> for a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/University" target="_blank">year</a> because of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> said âI'm feeling great â â¨and loving doing everything from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swimming_%28sport%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swimming_%28sport%29" target="_blank">swimming</a> to running to going to the gym I don't think I realised how much having a sore back affected me until it was fixedâI remember doing things like my Duke of Edinburgh hike and how difficult it wasâAs the operation got nearer I even had to have a special <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professor" target="_blank">chair</a> as sitting in an ordinary <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professor" target="_blank">chair</a> was too uncomfortable But now I'm looking forward to doing the Great <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" target="_blank">Women</a>'s 10k and then I'm heading to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/California"

friend who spotted the curve on my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_column" target="_blank">spine</a> and to all the staff at the

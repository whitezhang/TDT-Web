Controversial newspaper columnist Katie Hopkins has been blasted by the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights after she likened <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" target="_blank">migrants</a> to cockroachesJordanian Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said the reality television star had used language in her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" target="_blank">Sun</a> column similar to that used by newspapers and radio stations in Rwanda before the 1994 genocide that led to hundreds of thousands of people being slaughteredHe urged authorities in the UK to use the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law" target="_blank">law</a> to clamp down on &quotvicious verbal assault on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" target="_blank">migrants</a> and asylum seekers in the UK <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tabloid" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tabloid" target="_blank">tabloid</a> press&quot adding &quotThe Nazi media described people their masters wanted to eliminate as rats and cockroaches This type of language is clearly inflammatory and unacceptable especially in a national newspaper&quotThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" target="_blank">Sun</a>'s editors took an editorial decision to publish this <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_%28grammar%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Article_%28grammar%29" target="_blank">article</a> and  if it is found in breach of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law" target="_blank">law</a>  should be held responsible along with the author&quotHopkins wrote in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" target="_blank">Sun</a> last week that the UK should use gunships to send migrant boats home adding &quotMake no mistake these <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" target="_blank">migrants</a> are like cockroaches They might look a bit 'Bob Geldof's Ethiopia circa 1984' but they are built to survive a nuclear bomb&quotThe former Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother star used her column in the newspaper today to address her previous remarks saying it had been a &quotcautionary tale&quotShe wrote &quotI am reminded of the power of the pen One should be brave enough to speak out  but aware of the dangers which lurk in the depths of our vocabulary&quotNo one wants to see images of children drowned at sea no matter what their journey or their destination The next time you are thinking of clicking on a petition don't be angry about words&quotAccept our opinions differ Channel your outrage at the regimes causing people to flee And be part of the solution&quotA <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" target="_blank">Sun</a> spokesman said she and the paper would not be commenting furtherAn online petition urging the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sun" target="_blank">Sun</a> to remove Hopkins as a columnist has received almost 284000 signaturesMr Al Hussain did not limit himself to attacking Hopkins but aimed a broadside at the popular press in general adding &quotThis vicious verbal assault on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" target="_blank">migrants</a> and asylum seekers in the UK <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tabloid" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tabloid" target="_blank">tabloid</a> press has continued unchallenged under the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Law" target="_blank">law</a> for far too long&quotI am an unswerving advocate of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freedom_of_speech" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freedom_of_speech" target="_blank">freedom of expression</a> which is guaranteed under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR but it is not absolute Article 20 of the same Covenant says 'Any advocacy of national racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law'&quotHe also urged European countries to tackle racism and xenophobia which &quotunder the guise of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freedom_of_speech" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Freedom_of_speech" target="_blank">freedom of expression</a> are being allowed to feed a vicious cycle of vilification intolerance and politicisation of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" target="_blank">migrants</a> as well as of marginalised European minorities such as the Roma&quotHe added &quotWhile migration and refugee issues are completely valid topics for public debate it is imperative that migration policy decisions that affect people's lives and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_rights" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_rights" target="_blank">fundamental human rights</a> should be made on the basis of fact  not fiction exaggeration or blatant xenophobia&quotHistory has shown us time and again the dangers of demonising foreigners and minorities and it is extraordinary and deeply shameful to see these types of tactics being used in a variety of countries simply because racism and xenophobia are so easy to arouse in order to win votes or sell newspapers&quot

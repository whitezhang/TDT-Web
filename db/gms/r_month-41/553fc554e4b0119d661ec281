and asked me to drive in my works van to the top of the driveway at Marr Hall&quotI drove up and met him I exited my van and he exited his blue Mercedes Gwagon&quotHe opened his black leather jacket to reveal a shirt absolutely drenched saturated in blood&quot&quotHis first words to me were 'the f tried to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stabbing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stabbing" target="_blank">stab</a> me' &quotMr Agnew said that he drove Fleming to Greenock where he bought him a new shirt and tie to replace the blood soaked onesIn evidence Mr Fleming described Mr Agnew as a

who would &quotput the blame on anyone&quotThe expolice officer went on &quotHe is a selfobsessed person who does not care about the consequences of his actions Other people clear up his mess&quotRoss Agnew is the most unreliable person I know To think he would not tell anyone for 10 years about the evidence is absolutely ridiculous&quotMr Toner had been due to go on trial at the High Court in <a

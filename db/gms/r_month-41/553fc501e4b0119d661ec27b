the coffin&quot he told them&quotOne represents the beginning of life and the other represents the end&quot he said &quotAnd it is doubly sad when the two are so closely linked&quotWe are deeply deeply saddened when the life of someone so young is cut short and in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karen_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Karen_people" target="_blank">Karen</a>'s

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death_%28personification%29" target="_blank">death</a> and childhood are poles apart and twentyfour years simply does not seem the right time to die  it does not seem to add up&quotThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priest" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Priest" target="_blank">priest</a> told the congregation at the <a

Research</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" target="_blank">Fund</a> lost out on a windfall after eBay bosses said Mark's auction breached strict resale rulesHe wanted to auction off two seats for last Wednesday's WWE Live show at Glasgow's Hydro including a DVD package and once in a lifetime chance to meet one of the starsThe VIP package had attracted bids of over &pound1000WWE organisers claim the auction was rubberstamped before it went online They say eBay advisor even helped set it upBut eBay blocked the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraiser" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraiser" target="_blank">fundraiser</a> less than 24 hours before it was due to end as two fans were battling it out for the ticketsMark from Airdrie  said âThe whole thing has really annoyed me It's disgraceful âThe company who organised it all for me cleared it with eBay in advance of the auction going up  it was all done above boardâThe principal is equally as important as the cash lost to the Pancreatic Cancer Research <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" target="_blank">Fund</a>âFor a global service provider to agree in advance to the format and principle then pull the plug on Easter Weekend which left no opportunity to reschedule is quite frankly wrong  âA huge amount of effort and goodwill was put in place by lots of people to make it a wonderful event that both children and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Charity_%28practice%29" target="_blank">charity</a> would have benefited from but the end result is we are made to feel like <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ticket_%28admission%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ticket_%28admission%29" target="_blank">ticket</a> touts and in effect criminalsâDespite being originally told he only had six months left to live Mark has been receiving pioneering chemotherapy treatment that he hopes will allow him to live for longerHe hopes his F Cancer campaign will smash the &pound30000 he originally hoped it would raise So far it's reached &pound24000He said âThe chemotherapy is to last longer than the initial life expectancy I was given so it should give me a considerable life extension  fingers crossed&quotMy dad has cancer and passed away last year so I'm determined to fight itâIt's all about positivity I want to stay positive that's why I started up the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" target="_blank">fundraising</a> campaignâThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" target="_blank">fundraising</a> has been a community thing everyone is getting involved âYou can accept a terminal diagnosis or you can fight itâI'm absolutely going to fight it with every fibre of my bodyâA spokesman for WWE said âWe're hugely disappointed that at the 11th hour eBay pulled the plug on an auction to raise money for the Pancreatic Cancer Research <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fundraising" target="_blank">Fund</a> on the grounds it broke <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ticket_resale" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ticket_resale" target="_blank">ticket resale</a> rulesâThe <a

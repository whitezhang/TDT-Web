title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." target="_blank">Apple</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" target="_blank">Watch</a> in Glasgow as it was unveiled to the publicBut many of those taking the first opportunity to order the device from the city's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Store" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Store" target="_blank">Apple Store</a> â two weeks before it goes on sale â were already firm fansFor housewife Karyn Rogerson 42 it was all about reliving her childhood She said âIt's pretty cool to be able to answer your <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telephone" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Telephone" target="_blank">phone</a> on your <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Supermarket" target="_blank">Supermarket</a> manager Stuart Campbell 30 said âIt looks amazing smaller than I thought it would be with a great finishâThe â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." target="_blank">Apple</a> aficionadoâ also liked the handiness of being notified of texts and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Email" target="_blank">emails</a> with his only concern being the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch"

light the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." target="_blank">Apple</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" target="_blank">Watch</a> has just two buttons in addition to its <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Touchscreen" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Touchscreen" target="_blank">touch screen</a> the larger one reminiscent of an oldstyle winderBut it has so many apps and features that wearers who already constantly <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheque" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheque" target="_blank">check</a> their iPhone might find themselves unable to look away from it For those with more selfcontrol the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" target="_blank">watch</a> remains in standby mode until it automatically âcomes aliveâ when wearers lift their armSuch wearable technology has other potential downsides with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch"

irritating their friends by being able to âtapâ them for the sake of it send an image of their heartbeat or an instantly scribbled doodleEven <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apple_Inc." target="_blank">Apple</a> staff said âIt takes a bit of getting used toâOther features include a fitness app which checks blood pressure and distance

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Watch" target="_blank">watch</a>'s appeal could be limited by having to be used in conjunction with a relatively new iPhone and operating systemThat will make the device in some respects a kind of iPhone <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Remote_control" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Remote_control" target="_blank">remote control</a> â such as for taking calls and dictating textsBut it could also come in handy for selecting music scanning boarding passes and setting up <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camera"

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Provost" target="_blank">provost</a> had been out on the streets with party activists to drum up support for Douglas Alexander's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Election" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Election" target="_blank">election</a> bidHowever residents claim he was caught short in Glenmalloch Place and instead of asking to use a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toilet" target="_blank">toilet</a> he relieved himself at their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" target="_blank">bin</a> shelterRetired headteacher Brian Wright has been left so angry about the incident he has reported <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">Councillor</a> Caldwell to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethics" target="_blank">Ethical</a> Standards Commission reports our sister paper the Paisley Daily ExpressMore news from Paisley and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renfrewshire" target="_blank">Renfrewshire</a> Mr Wright 59 said âI've been left absolutely disgusted by this who on earth <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urination" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urination" target="_blank">urinates</a> in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" target="_blank">bin</a> area beside people's homesâI was sitting reading a book in my bedroom when I noticed a man going into the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" target="_blank">bin</a> area and at first I thought he was just binning some of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Election" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Election" target="_blank">election</a> materials he was carrying however he took his time and then left with a satisfied look on his faceâWhen I looked out I could clearly see the pool of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urine" target="_blank">urine</a> he had left I couldn't believe itâI chased after the group and spoke to Hugh Henry MSP because I wanted to know if he was in charge of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canvassing" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Canvassing" target="_blank">canvassing</a> and why he thought it was acceptable for someone to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urination" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urination" target="_blank">urinate</a> over my propertyâHowever I found him to be confrontational and aggressive so I turned my attention to who I now know to be depute <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Provost" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lord_Provost" target="_blank">provost</a> John Caldwell and asked him why he had <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urine" target="_blank">urinated</a> on my property to which he looked a bit sheepish and said âI shouldn't have done it'ââThat was all No apology from either of the men No offer to clean the mess They just turned and walked away as if they had much more important things to attend toâCan you imagine the stooshie if I was to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urination" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urination" target="_blank">urinate</a> in either of their gardens if I was caught a bit short one eveningâDadoftwo Mr Wright said he cleaned the mess up himself before any of his elderly neighbours stood in itHe added âThere's a 99yearold woman who lives beside me who uses that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" target="_blank">bin</a> shelter and I made sure the puddle was washed away and the area was bleached before she ended up getting covered in itâEvery time I think about it I'm left furious and I feel that I've given <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour</a> plenty of chances to give me a simple apology before I wrote to the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethics" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethics" target="_blank">Ethical</a> Standards Commission about the incidentâA second neighbour who asked not to be named echoed Mr Wright's viewedHe said âI spotted the man shuffling around in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osama_bin_Laden" target="_blank">bin</a> shelter although I didn't know what he was doing at the timeâIt wasn't until afterwards when the puddle of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urine" target="_blank">urine</a> was left that we knew what had happenedâI agree with Brian it's completely disgustingâWe contacted <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Councillor" target="_blank">Councillor</a> John Caldwell and Douglas Alexander's office in Paisley last nightCouncillor Caldwell refused to comment and there was no reply from the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Labour_Party_%28UK%29" target="_blank">Labour Party</a>

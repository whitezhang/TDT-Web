ANDY Murray might be dominant on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volleyball" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Volleyball" target="_blank">court</a> but it's Kim Sears who will wear the trousers in their marriage according to a handwriting expertGraphologist Jan Harrison analysed the couple's writing just days before their wedding in Dunblane on SaturdayAnd the results gave a rare insight into the dynamics of the couple's relationshipJan says the angular letters from artist Kim means she is likely to be even more competitive than <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis" target="_blank">tennis</a> ace AndyAnd she says the ex <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Championships,_Wimbledon" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/The_Championships,_Wimbledon" target="_blank">Wimbledon</a> champ's rounded writing shows him as a proud but sometimes misunderstood <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grammatical_person" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grammatical_person" target="_blank">person</a> who needs time aloneJan said âI can't help but notice that Andy's writing is very rounded and Kim's is more angularâSo I can safely say that I know who will be wearing the trousers in this householdâThe loop on her capital K is a sign of toughness She will be the most proactive even the most competitiveâThe angles mean she really needs a challenge and if something is too easy she will quickly lose interest and often try to find a more challenging way to do it âKim's signature also suggests she will have strong opinions and high principles which she sticks toâAndy's writing â taken from the match notes he made during the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Open" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Australian_Open" target="_blank">Australian Open</a> in January â shows a quiet sideJan said âHis writing is far more passive and yielding He might find himself a bit misunderstood because he can sometimes send out mixed signalsâThe leftward slant is rather more dominant and this reveals a strong mother link meaning he is more inclined to keep his thoughts and feelings to himself  âAndy's handwriting shows no big ego demands or need to demand attention although the large capitals at the beginning of his words do show that he does feels a certain pride in his  achievements âI think their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Personality_type" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Personality_type" target="_blank">personality</a> differences will work well with the less demanding Andy being content to let his wife take charge of a lot of thingsâThat analysis seemed on the money yesterday when the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tennis" target="_blank">tennis</a> ace revealed he had left all the wedding planning to Kim â apart from the foodHe said âI went along and did the food tasting and I also did the cake tasting as wellâThe music is something that we chat about together as wellâ

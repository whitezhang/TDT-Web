OVER 50 years ago a nation watched and held its breath as a tormented <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scots</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">father</a> dangled his baby son on the edge of a 50ft dropTelevision cameras broadcast live from the scene in Bloomsbury <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/London" target="_blank">London</a> as efforts were made to talk Thomas French down from the roof of a threestorey buildingBut 31yearold Thomas in the grip of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Depression_%28mood%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Depression_%28mood%29" target="_blank">depression</a> seemed resolute in his threat to hurl himself and his 22monthold son to their <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">deaths</a> ignoring the entreaties of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">policemen</a> and their fire brigade colleaguesFinally in desperation senior officers allowed a relatively inexperienced young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">policewoman</a> to try to get through to himTheir last resort Margaret Cleland stepped forward on to the roof and addressed Thomas in soothing tonesOn hearing the gentle brogue of a fellow <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scot</a> the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Torture" target="_blank">tortured</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">dad</a> began to open up and was drawn into conversation for the first time during the standoffFor more than an hour Margaret spoke gently to Thomas while she edged her way closer to him and his distressed sonDown in the street below the crowds who had gasped in horror each <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">time</a> Thomas had swung the infant over the drop were stunned into silenceAll eyes remained glued on the scene as the onlookers hoped and prayed that Thomas would give himself up to the diminutive 26yearold WPCMeanwhile Margaret kept her own gaze firmly fixed on father and son as she whispered words of comfort and brought herself within arms' reach of the pairWithout warning she suddenly lunged for Thomas and clung on to him so tightly he toppled forwards releasing his grip on the screaming childMargaret grabbed hold of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Stuart" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Stuart" target="_blank">Stuart</a> and cradled him while male colleagues who had been waiting in the wings leapt forward and restrained his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Father" target="_blank">father</a> preventing him from throwing himself into the abyss below The onlookers below sent up a rousing cheer echoed in households across <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Great_Britain" target="_blank">Britain</a> watching the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drama_film" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drama_film" target="_blank">drama</a> unfold on televisionHalf a century on the Record has tracked down the baby at the centre of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drama_film" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drama_film" target="_blank">drama</a> â and he has finally been able to publicly voice his gratitude to the brave young <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">policewoman</a> who saved his lifeSadly <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Stuart" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/House_of_Stuart" target="_blank">Stuart</a> French â who had never before seen the footage of his dramatic rescue â learned the full story of Margaret's heroism on that day in March 1964 too late to offer his thanks in personMargaret originally from Twechar Dunbartonshire <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a> in 2011 after a short battle with cancerStuart said âI never got the chance to say thankyou to Margaret and I never knew what became of herâBut I want to say how grateful I am that she was able to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rescue_Me_%28TV_series%29"

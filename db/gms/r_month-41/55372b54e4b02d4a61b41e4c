WHEN Paul McGowan emerged from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Airdrie_United_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Airdrie_United_F.C." target="_blank">Airdrie</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheriff_Court" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sheriff_Court" target="_blank">Sheriff Court</a> this week the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_person_%28video_games%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/First_person_%28video_games%29" target="_blank">first person</a> who spoke to him was his dadThe message to his son was unequivocal âIf you don't learn now you never willâNever has a nail been hit so firmly on the headIn fact with words like that from a parent it makes you wonder how the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." target="_blank">Dundee</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Player_%28game%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Player_%28game%29" target="_blank">player</a> got himself into such bother in the first place McGowan escaped a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" target="_blank">jail</a> term by the skin of his teeth after being convicted of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Police_officer" target="_blank">police</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assault" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assault" target="_blank">assault</a> for the third <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">time</a>  There is little point in arguing that he didn't deserve to do <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Time_%28magazine%29" target="_blank">time</a> After all anyone who knows McGowan will tell you that even he had accepted in his own mind that he'd be locked behind bars for at least three monthsMake no mistake he should have gone downThere is absolutely no â¨condoning what he did and the fact he failed to take heed on the previous two occasions is almost unforgivable Certainly something is skewed in our <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" target="_blank">justice</a> system when a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bigotry" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bigotry" target="_blank">bigoted</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rangers_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rangers_F.C." target="_blank">Rangers</a> fan is still banged up for singing the Billy Boys in the street back in February yet McGowan is a free man But whether you like it or not a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Judge" target="_blank">judge</a> decided to spare him and his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Career" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Career" target="_blank">career</a> on the basis that â¨somewhere deep inside that 27yearold <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body" target="_blank">body</a> of his there is a decent human beingA guy who has an â¨exemplary behavioural record at his place of work Who is a doting dad to his only son And to those â¨closest to him doesn't have a bad bone in his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body" target="_blank">body</a> I know it's hard to believe when you look at McGowan's convictions and offfield antics But it's truePlenty of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Folk_music" target="_blank">folk</a> will already â¨have written him off as an uncontrollable ned who can't handle his drink That general perception of him â getting â¨bevvied at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Casino" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Casino" target="_blank">house</a> parties before verbally and physically attacking cops â isn't a healthy oneAnd he's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Big_Time_Rush" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Big_Time_Rush" target="_blank">stuck</a> with itBut it's not the full storyMcGowan like so many other flawed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scottish</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Football" target="_blank">footballers</a> of the past is a victim of his own surroundings He's an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Airdrie_United_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Airdrie_United_F.C." target="_blank">Airdrie</a> boy through and throughHis <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawyer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lawyer" target="_blank">lawyer</a> revealed the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dens_Park" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dens_Park" target="_blank">Dens Park</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midfielder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midfielder" target="_blank">midfielder</a> who was placed on a 16week tagging order had a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gambling" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gambling" target="_blank">gambling</a> problemThat might well be the case But to anyone on the outside <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcoholism" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcoholism" target="_blank">alcohol</a> is his biggest demonHe becomes a different â¨person when he's had a drinkMcGowan is still immersed in the same âstreet culture' he was used to at 16 or 17He finds it impossible to drag himself away from the housing scheme pals he grew up withIt's incredible that what would become repeat offending only began when he was 23 years oldYou'd think if he was going to get caught up in these type of incidents they would have occurred when he was 18 or 19Is that a damning <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indictment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indictment" target="_blank">indictment</a> on McGowan's immaturityOr is it that while he's still hanging around the same â¨troublestrewn streets he's always done disorder has just continued to follow him around I would suggest the latter Charlie Miller had the same issue while at <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rangers_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rangers_F.C." target="_blank">Rangers</a> back in the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/1990s" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/1990s" target="_blank">90s</a> Like McGowan he was blessed with an ability few â¨<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_people" target="_blank">Scottish</a> players have But by his own admission he failed to make the most of it because he couldn't leave his âpals' behindMiller isn't a bad person far from it But unfortunately some of the company he kept around that time contributed to him getting into hot waterMcGowan is the very same In November when he was charged the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dens_Park" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dens_Park" target="_blank">Dens Park</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club" target="_blank">club</a> arranged for him to move into a flat in DundeeIt was a credible attempt to help their playmaker a bid to take him away from what THEY believe are the problems and temptations around himYet here we are five months on and the bed in that flat still hasn't been slept in He promised the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club" target="_blank">club</a> he'd flit to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tayside" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tayside" target="_blank">Tayside</a> but has never quite got round to it It's as if he's incapable â unless taken by the hand â of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oasis_%28band%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oasis_%28band%29" target="_blank">turning</a> his back on the pastAnd there's something sad about that We all know McGowan isn't a daft teenager He should be taking those â¨steps himselfBut if he does have demons and mentally isn't in the right place someone from his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Club" target="_blank">club</a> should be chaperoning him on the next train northMaybe just maybe it could make the difference McGowan says this is it the turning point in his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Video_game" target="_blank">life</a> He's absolutely certain he'll never step out of line again The truth is he doesn't know None of us doesBut just recently McGowan has changed Whether it was the fear of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prison" target="_blank">jail</a> not seeing his boy not playing <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Association_football" target="_blank">football</a> whatever those close to him say he's been differentEvery Thursday his regular car pool <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." target="_blank">Dundee</a> teammates have dropped him off at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professional_Footballers%27_Association" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Professional_Footballers%27_Association" target="_blank">PFA</a> offices in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> after training to attend counselling sessionsHe doesn't have to go Just like moving to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." target="_blank">Dundee</a> he could quite easily have put it off or halfheartedly tried to attendBut no he's there of his own accord And he deserves a shred of credit for that at leastIt's a long road back for him in terms of convincing people â myself included â that he's learned his lesson But for his and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dundee_F.C." target="_blank">Dundee</a>'s sake we should all hope that he's taken his old man's words to heart

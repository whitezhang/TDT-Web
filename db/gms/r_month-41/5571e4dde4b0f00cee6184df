href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" target="_blank">Prophet</a> touched her inappropriately while claiming he was curing her of a stomach ailmentThe 32yearold African mother of four said she had been persuaded by her husband's family to join an English branch of a Pentecostal church known as Agape for All Nations based in Stirling The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" target="_blank">woman</a> who cannot be named said as part of her involvement with the church she had to undergo an allnight âdeliveranceâ after her husband whom she has since left told her she had to be delivered from demonsShe said âIn Manchester in 2011 I went an eight hour deliverance service I was literally pinned to the floor and people were pushing my head It was quite a violent processâShe said the Agape church which she said now had many branches was founded by 51yearold Walter Masocha who was called âThe Archbishopâ and âThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" target="_blank">Prophet</a>â and claimed to have heard <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a> speaking to him after <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fasting" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fasting" target="_blank">fasting</a> for a week at a prayer meeting in St AndrewsShe said âHe said that in an audible voice <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a> had told him to found the church and âdeliver my people who are suffering'âShe said she paid several visits to Masocha's large home Cosyneuk House at Sauchieburn near Stirling which she said had five bathrooms ânumerousâ bedrooms and a large kitchenShe said Mashocha  who always had a bodyguard  used to touch her when he was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" target="_blank">praying</a> for herShe told jurors at Falkirk Sheriff Court  âIt was on more than one occasion I went home and spoke to my husband and my husband said he [Masocha] was anointed and he was The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" target="_blank">Prophet</a> and he was allowed to do thatâShe said she and other female church members called Masocha âMy DadâShe said one one occasion in 2012 she had gone into Masocha's office in Coseyneuk House âto see him about the work of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a>âMasocha had hugged her âvery intimatelyâ caressing her back and kissing her round the neckShe said âI felt confused I felt violatedâHe was saying âreceive my love'âAt one point I felt his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Man" target="_blank">manhood</a> against meâOn another occasion in May 2013 also in Masocha's office he told her he would <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" target="_blank">pray</a> âfor her whole <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Body" target="_blank">body</a>âShe said âHe touched the top of my head my eyes my nose my ears He was saying âI'm <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" target="_blank">praying</a> for every part of your body'âHe touched my shoulders and went down and touched my chestâI felt violatedâShe said she had once gone to his office for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" target="_blank">prayer</a> with a stomach complaintShe said âHe said he was going to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prayer" target="_blank">pray</a> it away He touched my tummy then his hand went down my body onto my private partsâWeeping she said âIt was like he was feeling me I was so shocked At that time I saw him as somebody who could never do any wrong because that was what he used to teach usâMy husband told me âthe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prophets_of_Islam" target="_blank">Prophet</a> is seeing something in your genitals that needs to be removed so he was removing that'âOutside I had to believe that but inside I didn'tâThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" target="_blank">woman</a> told the court that she later fled her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Marriage" target="_blank">matrimonial</a> home with her children and spoke about what had happened to her brother and othersShe said âSuddenly my eyes were opened This man was touching me inappropriatelyâShe added that Masocha has told her that <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a> had told him that âhe was the one with the keys to her destinyâShe said she and her husband had paid over âa lot of moneyâ to the church including &pound600 in an envelope they had saved for a mortgage âchild creditsâ and âtithesâShe said âThe doctrine we were taught was that we had to release money and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/God" target="_blank">God</a> would open doors for usââYou are putting in most of your money to the point where your children are left hungryâMasocha of Sauchieburn denies sexually assaulting the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Woman"

Don the sheep dog caused major tailbacks today after driving on to one of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland's</a> busiest motorways during rush hourThe Collie leaned on the controls of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farm" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farm" target="_blank">farm</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> as shepherd Tom Hamilton tended to his flock  sending it <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Speed_limit" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Speed_limit" target="_blank">speeding</a> across fieldsThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four-wheel_drive" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four-wheel_drive" target="_blank">4x4</a> motored down a hill before crashing through a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fence" target="_blank">fence</a> and onto the northbound carriageway of the busy M74Cars were brought to a halt as the daredevil Collie careered over three lanes of motorwayEventually Don and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Gators" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Gators" target="_blank">Gator</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four-wheel_drive" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four-wheel_drive" target="_blank">four wheel drive</a> <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> came to rest on the central reservation near Abington South LanarkshireAnd miraculously Don was none the worse for his motorway adventure Owner <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" target="_blank">Tom</a> 77 said he was relieved no one was injured during the incident and that fourandahalf year old Don was no worse for wear following his adventureThe drama began near junction 13 at 815am while <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cat" target="_blank">Tom</a> who has been a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farmer" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farmer" target="_blank">farmer</a> all his life was tending to lambs in a field on his 1000 acre Kirkton FarmTom was attempting to get hold of a lamb which looked like it was trying to escapeHe had left Don in the cab of the mini <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Gators" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florida_Gators" target="_blank">Gator</a> while checking on his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livestock" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Livestock" target="_blank">livestock</a> and the next thing he knew it was careering down the hill towards the motorwayTom said âI tried to run after the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tractor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tractor" target="_blank">tractor</a> but it was too fast and I fell overâI got the fright of my life when I saw it heading towards the motorwayâ The <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four-wheel_drive" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Four-wheel_drive" target="_blank">4x4</a> crossed the motorway  the main route into central Scotland from the south  before finally coming to rest at the reservationBy chance a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" target="_blank">local</a> happened to be passing at the time and pulled over to stop the oncoming trafficTom then removed the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle" target="_blank">vehicle</a> from the carriageway but by this time Don was no where to be seenHe added âThe whole thing was over in a matter of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/60_Minutes" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/60_Minutes" target="_blank">minutes</a> In the panic I didn't realise Don must have jumped out of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tractor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tractor" target="_blank">tractor</a> and disappearedâAfter I moved it there was no sign of Don but my son went out and found him a few <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/60_Minutes" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/60_Minutes" target="_blank">minutes</a> laterâTo be honest I think he just wants to get back to work It'll be the last time I leave him in the cab on his own thoughâLarge queues of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Traffic_congestion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Traffic_congestion" target="_blank">traffic</a> built up as police attempted to clear the busy route After 30 minutes <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Traffic_congestion" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Traffic_congestion" target="_blank">traffic</a> began moving normallyMotorists were alerted to the incident by a tweet from <a

target="_blank">tractor</a> after he possibly didn't engage it properly allowing it to build up <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Speed" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Speed" target="_blank">speed</a> as it rolled down the hillThere are skid marks visible from the top of the field the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tractor" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tractor" target="_blank">tractor</a> was in stretching for around 120m until it smashed through the wooden <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fence" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fence" target="_blank">fence</a> and careered down a steep embankmentTom who has owned Kirkton <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farm" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Farm" target="_blank">Farm</a> for 52 years also revealed he went to his <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Train" target="_blank">local</a> GP for a checkup and was told he was fine but was to âtake it easy' But within hours of the incident he was back out in his fields with trusty companion DonHe added âDon is a great dog He has worked for me since he was about two and is great with the animals and kids as well  he has a really good natureâHe didn't even bark during the incident despite being in an outofcontrol <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vehicle"

out of the field and onto the M74âA spokeswoman for Police <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> added âAt around

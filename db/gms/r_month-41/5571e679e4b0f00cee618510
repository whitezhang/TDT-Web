 ED MILIBAND last night snubbed a pledge from Nicola Sturgeon to make him PM by declaring âIt's a noâ  He rebuffed the invitation for a âprogressiveâ alliance during the latest leader's election debate  The live BBC programme also featured Green party leader Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood â who both backed Sturgeon's call to lock out <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a> UKIP leader Nigel Farage was there but <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">Cameron</a> and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democrats" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liberal_Democrats" target="_blank">Lib Dem</a> leader <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Clegg" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_Clegg" target="_blank">Nick Clegg</a> were not During a confident performance from Sturgeon she told a UKwide audience she would help put Miliband into power if he promised to be better than the Tories But Miliband told her âI've got fundamental disagreements with you Nicola âIn the last couple of weeks you've revealed you haven't ruled out a second referendum on independence in the next five yearsâWe're just very different we've got very different viewsâI respect your views that you want to break up the country but that's not my viewâI think that would be a disaster for the working people of Britain âWe have profound differences between us that's why I'm not going to have a coalition with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a>  âI'm never going to put at risk the unity of the United KingdomâIt would be a disaster for us to start competing with each other driving down wages dismantling the basic state pension which is the foundation of security in retirement â and dismantling our countryâSo it's a noâMiliband kept relatively lowkey in the debate And a snap poll by Survation showed he was judged the âwinnerâHe was backed by 35 per cent compared with 31 per cent for SturgeonAnd viewers favoured Miliband as PM over <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">Cameron</a> 45 per cent to 40 per cent in a headtoheadBut Sturgeon clearly won over the independently selected audience on topics ranging from immigration to defence and housingShe was judged the best performer with 35 per cent against 29 per cent for Miliband Sturgeon had the most âappealing personalityâ with 30 per cent supportAnd she was applauded at the end for trying to push Miliband into agreeing a postelection deal She said âI will never ever do a deal with the Tories â let me make that crystal clearâThe polls though show that Ed isn't strong enough to get rid of the Tories on his ownâSo I will work with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> with Leanne with Natalie so that together we can get rid of the ToriesâI want Ed to replace the Tories with something different something better something more progressive because progressive change is what the country is crying out for That's my offer to Ed MilibandâIf he's prepared to be better than the Tories then I'm prepared to work with him to allow him to replace the Tories which is what I think many people want to seeâSturgeon took a softer approach to <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> than in previous clashes but still had sharp criticism on <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> spending plansShe said he was âscared to be boldâSturgeon added âI think it's time not for a pretend alternative to austerity â it is time for a real alternative to austerity âIf <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> won't be bold enough on its own I think people should vote for parties who will hold <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> to account and make them bolderâI don't say there's no difference between Ed Miliband and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a> â I say there is not a big enough difference between Ed Miliband and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a>âMiliband said he would continue fighting for a majority government which polls suggest is not likely <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> face a desperate battle against the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> â and could lose most of their seats in ScotlandAsked about potential coalitions Miliband said âI have an oldfashioned view â let the people decideâI want a majority <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_Labour_Party" target="_blank">Labour</a> goverment because I think it's the best thing for the countryâAlthough dominated by the tussle between Miliband and Sturgeon Farage was vocal on key UKIP issuesAstonishingly he even picked a fight with the audience at the debate chaired by David Dimbleby He complained the crowd was too leftwing âeven by BBC standardsâFarage played to type by suggesting foreigners are to blame for economic problemsHe said the âbloatedâ overseas aid budget should be cut and new social housing should be for UK citizens onlyHe also tried to whip up division by saying he'd stop sending <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> so much cash âover Hadrian's Wallâ What did we learn from last night's debate The most revealing thing was that the representatives from the Greens UKIP the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> and Plaid Cymru talked about protesting against <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a> That's fine But Ed Miliband was the only person in the debate who can replace <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a>  That's a fundamental difference Ed offered a vision of a better and fairer country for workingclass families What we also saw was the difference between what Nicola Sturgeon says in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> and EnglandIn England she talks tough about ending austerity Yet when she's in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> she gets exposed on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a>'s plan to cut <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> off from UKwide taxes and spending â and the devastating consequences that would have for the most vulnerable ScotsThe debate made the choice facing Scots clearer than ever A Labour government on the side of workingclass people or a Tory government imposing more failed austerity LAST night we saw another hugely impressive performance by Nicola Sturgeon â making the clear case for a strong team of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> MPs at Westminster to make <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scotland" target="_blank">Scotland's</a> voice heard and deliver progressive politics for everyone across the UKNo one party will win an outright majority at this election â so this means we must build bridges between progressive parties to deliver changeHolding the balance of power at Westminster the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> can make a Labour government bolder and more progressive and bring an end to austerity enabling us to invest in public services and tackle inequalityAs Nicola Sturgeon made clear tonight if Ed Miliband is prepared to be better than the Tories then the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> are prepared to work with himThe real question for Ed Miliband is would he rather see <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a> back in Downing Street than work with the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scottish_National_Party" target="_blank">SNP</a> Try our quick news quiz below

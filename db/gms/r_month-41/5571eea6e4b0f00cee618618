corpse was discovered in a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glasgow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a> flatJonathan Kelly the machete maniac who became Scotland's most dangerous prisoner then apparently vanished off the face of the earthRezgar Zengana a sexual predator who <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rape" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rape" target="_blank">raped</a> a young woman after posing as a taxi driver then ran away rather than face justiceAnd superspiv Dariusz Eugeniusz Kazmierczak who faces no fewer than 350 charges of online fraudThey're the fugitive five â and the first men to have their mugshots plastered all over an FBIstyle Most Wanted list launched today by Police ScotlandFerguson has been on the run for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seven_Years%27_War" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seven_Years%27_War" target="_blank">seven years</a> Zengana for more than six Ali for more than four and Kazmierczak for almost a yearAnd police admitted in December that they hadn't had a single sighting of Kelly since he cut off his electronic tag and did a runner after being freed early from jailBut Detective Inspector David Wilson head of Police Scotland's Fugitive Unit has the same message for them allYou can run but you won't hide forever However long it takes we will get youWilson and his team have caught 215 fugitives in a twoyear period and he hopes the Most Wanted list will get him the help he needs from the public to snare many more He said of the website âIt's been a successful tactic right across the world and we'll be adding and removing individuals as we go onâAny assistance we can get from the public would be greatly appreciatedâEvery case is important to Wilson but getting Deco Ferguson would be a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Major_League_Baseball" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Major_League_Baseball" target="_blank">major</a> prize He's been a wanted man since 2007 when barman Tam Cameron 49 was gunned down outside the Auchinairn Tavern in Bishopbriggs near GlasgowFerguson's fellow suspect <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heroin" target="_blank">heroin</a> dealer Billy Bates was found dead in the Clyde weeks after the murderPolice believe Bates was <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">killed</a> because he wanted to give himself up They are keen to speak to Ferguson about what happened to himThe Record understands Ferguson is now in Spain under the protection of criminals from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ireland" target="_blank">Ireland</a> It's also believed he's had surgery to repair his ear after losing a chunk of it years ago in a brawlWilson said Ferguson was extremely dangerous He added âHe is wanted for murder using a firearm and anybody using firearms has to be considered a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Major_League_Baseball" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Major_League_Baseball" target="_blank">major</a> riskâThere were just under 100 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murder" target="_blank">murders</a> in 2007 and only three involved firearmsâFrom that point of view the risk around Ferguson is probably higher than mostâThe fact he has managed to evade capture for <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seven_Years%27_War" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seven_Years%27_War" target="_blank">seven years</a> shows he has a certain amount of support around himâSpain is a favourite bolthole for Scots crooks on the run but police fear Israr Ali could be thousands of miles

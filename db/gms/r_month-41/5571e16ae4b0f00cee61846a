A RELIEVED mum found out by text that her son had survived an avalanche on Everest triggered by the devastating <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> in NepalMatthew Thorne 36 was at basecamp on the world's highest mountain when it was rocked by 78 magnitude tremor And as the death toll across the country soared to more than 2000 Matthew's parents and brother Mark endured an agonising wait for news But at 1245pm yesterday his mum Marcelline received the best text of her life It read âHi this is Khristian Matthew is fine and in Namche Bazaar We are heading south to lukla airport tomorrow in hopes of flying out of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu" target="_blank">Kathmandu</a> as soon as possible He sends his loveâ Fighting back tears of joy Marcelline 62 told The Record âI am overwhelmed and overjoyed âIt's a big relief âIt will take more than an <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> to stop my boyâ Several Scots have been caught up in terrifying aftermath of the country's deadliest <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> for more than 80 years On Saturday it struck an area of central <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepal" target="_blank">Nepal</a> between the capital <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu" target="_blank">Kathmandu</a> and the city of Pokhara There have been a number of aftershocks since including a 67 magnitude tremor on Sunday And more avalanches were reported near Mount Everest leaving many climbers and guides cut off from the devastated base camp Matthew's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> had not heard from the property consultant since April 12 And ominously his last blog post from <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kathmandu" target="_blank">Kathmandu</a> on April 8 ended âI am ready to go got me medication for altitude and all my mountain gear I hope to reach 5650m with views of Everest in about 7 days âWhat nextâ One of Matthew's ambitions was to climb Everest and he was keen to fulfil it before he returned home to Scotland after more than a decade living abroad He flew to Lukla on April 12 and expected to take a fortnight to reach basecamp but when the news broke on Saturday his family feared his dream could turn into a nightmare Retired civil servant Marcelline said âIt has been a total rollercoaster âYou go up from thinking 'He is fine he is ok' âBut then as a husband and a wife as a mother and a father you fear the reality could be that he is not fine âYou are very realistic about the fact that you could get bad newsâ The mumoftwo was buoyed by the âwonderful supportâ of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Family" target="_blank">family</a> and Matthew's friends in England France and New Zealand The New Zealand commissioner in <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepal" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nepal" target="_blank">Nepal</a> was also trying to obtain updates as Mark holds joint Kiwi and UK citizenship But the magic moment finally came at lunchtime yesterday Marcelline of Stirling said âMy husband and I were standing at our door about to lock upâI had a cheescake in one hand and he had wine and flowers in the other hand âWe were going out to visit friends and I thought 'This looks a bit odd' as it was an unrecognised number âI thought it could be about MatthewâI looked into it and it was a message from I think one of his guides âI couldn't believe it&quotAll I saw and zoomed in mentally to was 'Matthew is safe' âI could not believe it âIt is the best news ever âI hope this gives a bit of heart to others who are waiting on newsâSCOTLAND'S aid agency has launched an emergency appeal to help survivors of the Nepalese <a

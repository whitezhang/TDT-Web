A YOUNG boy was among at least three <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> killed yesterday as a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boat" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boat" target="_blank">boat</a> packed with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immigration" target="_blank">migrants</a> ran aground in the MediterraneanThe lad and two others <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drowning" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drowning" target="_blank">drowned</a> yards off the coast of the Greek island of Rhodes as 100 shivering survivors were helped to safety Last night Italy and Malta were scrambling to help two more stricken <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boat" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boat" target="_blank">boats</a> in the Med with hundreds of African families trapped on board Another official said six different rescue operations were under way Teams are still searching for bodies and survivors after an estimated 900 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> were feared <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drowning" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drowning" target="_blank">drowned</a> on Sunday off the Italian coast in one of the worst <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea" target="_blank">sea</a>  <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disaster" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disaster" target="_blank">disasters</a> in decades David Cameron said âIt has been a dark day for EuropeâThe PM and other EU chiefs are now under mounting pressure to reverse a controversial decision to withdraw support for search and rescue operations in the MedAt least 1600 <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> have already <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drowning" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drowning" target="_blank">drowned</a> this year as they flee <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" target="_blank">povertystricken</a> and wartorn parts of Africa and the Middle East for a new life in EuropeDuring the same period last year the death toll was just 17 Only a handful of survivors were found by Italian coastguards and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fisherman" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fisherman" target="_blank">fishermen</a> who rushed to the scene of Sunday's <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tragedy_%28event%29" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tragedy_%28event%29" target="_blank">tragedy</a> off the island of LampedusaVito Margiotta captain of one of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fishing_vessel" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fishing_vessel" target="_blank">fishing boats</a> said âIt was a scene from hell We spotted <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> in the water but none of them were aliveâIt brought tears to our eyes to think of all those who ended up at the bottom of the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sea" target="_blank">sea</a>âAn Italian border official told how he found the body of one young boy floating in the waterFrancesco Gallo said âI was praying that he would be alive but a few moments later all hope <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Death" target="_blank">died</a>âI gathered him up in my arms as though he was my own sonâI saw children's shoes clothing backpacks floating in the water But we didn't find a single survivor â not oneâRecord numbers of <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> are trying to flee to Europe and more than 30000 have made the crossing successfully in 2015Many come from wartorn Syria and Libya Others hope to escape <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Poverty" target="_blank">poverty</a> and violence in Somalia Senegal and Eritrea Heartless smugglers charge huge fees to traffic <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/People" target="_blank">people</a> across the Med in dangerously overcrowded and unsuitable vesselsMany of the gangs are able to operate with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impunity" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impunity" target="_blank">impunity</a> in Libya since the Britishbacked toppling of Colonel <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muammar_Gaddafi" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muammar_Gaddafi"

Pauline <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wood" target="_blank">Wood</a> worked fulltime until around four yearsâ¨ ago when she was forced to quit her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employment" target="_blank">job</a> after developing severe arthritis in her legsBut the grandmotherofthreeâ¨ became suicidal when a benefits <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" target="_blank">investigation</a> cut her <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Payment" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Payment" target="_blank">payments</a>â¨to 52p per yearPauline was forced to survive on pennies for six months before she was cleared of any wrongdoingThe <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" target="_blank">investigation</a> centred on the sale of her house But her turmoilâ¨ was compounded when a Toryled review into her illness found her fit to workThe 57yearold blames theâ¨ <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Welfare" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Welfare" target="_blank">welfare</a> reforms introduced by <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/David_Cameron" target="_blank">David Cameron</a>'s <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government"

<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unemployment_benefits" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Unemployment_benefits" target="_blank">unemployment benefit</a> That was to keep my council tax and

target="_blank">Government</a> paid meâThe pitiful sum was paid toâ¨ Aberdeen City Council who continued to meet Pauline's rent and councilâ¨ tax paymentsShe lived off handouts from a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Food_bank" target="_blank">food bank</a> and the generosity of her friends and family Pauline blames her problems on the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Government" target="_blank">Government</a>'s decision toâ¨ overhaul the <a

title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Disability" target="_blank">disabled</a> claimants to take part in humiliating reviews to see if theyâ¨ were fit for workShe said âWhen I saw the letter seeing how little I was to receive I broke down in tears I just couldn't believe the way I was treatedâI got a letter from the benefits <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Office" target="_blank">office</a> because they wanted to seeâ¨ me I was paying all my bills and everythingâThey produced bank statements from previous years and

back for the last four years and produce each and every receiptâThey told me there and then my <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Employee_benefit"

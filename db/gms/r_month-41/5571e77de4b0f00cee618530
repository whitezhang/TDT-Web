 SCOTLAND'S medical meltdown has been laid bare by a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> where just two doctors are left to help 10000 patients  Five of the seven GPs at Kersiebank Medical Practice in Grangemouth have left since January The exodus is <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence-based_medicine" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evidence-based_medicine" target="_blank">evidence</a> of the GP shortage crisis facing the NHS in Scotland Patients have had to queue outside the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> at 8am just to get an appointment that dayA telephone triage system has been branded a disgrace after patients were left hanging on the phone for up to 90 minutesMany of those who tried to get appointments were told there were no slots left â and to go through the same farcical phone process the following daySome patients tried for a week for an appointmentTriage is supposed to make the system fairer with <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> staff arranging for a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" target="_blank">doctor</a> or nurse to ring the patient back hours laterBut the system means working people have to sacrifice at least a day's work as they hang around waiting to be seenJanet Cave 56 had tried several times for an appointment before succeeding on TuesdayShe said âI phoned the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> on Monday morning to get an appointment and was No59 in the queueâI spent a fortune on my mobile phone bill Eventually I got a receptionist who said that I was too late and there were no appointments leftâShe said I would have to try again the next dayâI phoned again and eventually got my name on the list and the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" target="_blank">doctor</a> phoned me back with an appointmentâThe practice this week urged patients not to turn up in person but each morning has seen people queue at the surgeryKersiebank is being taken over by the NHS Forth Valley on May 1 with new staff brought in as they try to recruit GPs to fill the gapsBut Grangemouth MP Michael Connarty slammed the health board's slow reactionHe said âThis has gone from a staffing problem to a fullblown crisis and the health board have not responded with enough urgency We have known that the practice was to be two doctors down and two others to follow for a couple of months âThe health board should have taken over by the start of AprilâThey have seen this coming and not given heed to the demeaning and stressful situation faced by people needing the help of a GPâWhat is happening in Grangemouth is possibly symptomatic of what seems to be emerging all over ScotlandâI have it from a good source that GPs can do better by leaving practice work and getting locum contractsâI also believe there is a pattern of stressedout GPs negotiating parttime contracts and of course many GPs are retiringâ The Grangemouth fiasco came to light just a day after the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Medical_Association" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Medical_Association" target="_blank">British Medical Association</a> warned that a third of Scottish GPs hope to retire in the next five years â sparking a staffing crisis  A fifth of Scottish practices are already shortstaffed <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Medical_Association" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/British_Medical_Association" target="_blank">BMA</a> spokesman Dr Andrew Buist said â<a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/General_practitioner" target="_blank">General practice</a> is already woefully shortstaffed and unless urgent action is taken to improve recruitment and retention of GPs <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" target="_blank">patient care</a> will be compromised and the Government's flagship integration reforms will likely failâSupermarket worker Jacqueline Forbes 47 was forced to turn up at the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> before her shift because like many patients she can't take phone calls at workShe said âI went down at 8am on Monday and there were loads of people there by the time the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> opened at halfpast I filled in a form and was told a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" target="_blank">doctor</a> would phone me laterâI discovered at work that I had a missed call which I presume was from the practice I had to go back the next day and sort it out all over againâPaul Murray 48 turned up at the practice last Wednesday and was given a ticket He said âI was No22 and there were 10 people seen before me I got an appointment for 1120am which meant hanging about for three hoursâRetired council worker William Dodds 68 also slammed the ticketing system He was 28th in the queue when he went to the surgeryHe said âIt seemed a ridiculous way to do things I don't see why you couldn't just phone up and get an appointmentâOne patient told how they found themselves 62nd in the phone queue despite calling right on opening time She said âAt 120pm I got a phone call back from a <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Physician" target="_blank">doctor</a> saying to come into the <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> at 250pm the same dayâIt's a disgrace that I have to set aside a whole day on the offchance of me actually getting an appointmentâI can't take calls at work but how am I meant to say to my employer that I'm taking a day off in case I get an appointment with my GPâNHS Forth Valley said Kersiebank's catchment area had been reduced to tackle the crisis The board said they will take over the practice on May 1 after waiving a standard sixmonth notice period in the interests of patients and <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surgery" target="_blank">surgery</a> staffA spokesman said âAlthough the medical practice has advertised for replacement doctors like a number of GP practices across the UK it has been unable to recruit GPs âWork is under way to recruit a  team of salaried GPs employed by the health board who would be able to provide support to Kersiebank and other local practices which are  experiencing similar capacity challengesâ The practice website warns patients âYou may be aware of the current national GP shortage and as such we have not been able to find any GP replacements and are struggling to find locum GPs to helpâThis leaves the practice in a very difficult situation Therefore from March only âon the day' appointments will be availableâ A Scottish Government spokeswoman said âUnder this government spending on GP services has increased by &pound697million or 10 per cent and  the number of GPs has increased by 69 per cent âWe are aware of the difficulties in recruitment that are affecting Kersiebank NHS Forth Valley have agreed to take over temporary responsibility for the practice to maintain highquality local <a href="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" title="http://dbpedia.org/resource/Health_care" target="_blank">medical service</a>â

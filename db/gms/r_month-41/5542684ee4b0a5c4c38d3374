George Bowie and his anthems have pretty much become part of most clubbers Saturday night routine since the Clyde One DJ started offering shout outs around 20 years agoPlaying the songs loved by ravers young and old while giving them a 'menchy' onair has created the perfect formula for the show to be one of the most popular in Scotland&quotGBX is very much part of Scottish culture We are focusing on what people like in Glasgow and the West of Scotland If GBX was UKwide it wouldn't work In Scotland we almost have our own scene nobody had tapped into that before&quot explained GeorgeHe added &quotI think a lot of people were a bit too snobby about it I am not trying to be cool I just want to give people a good time&quotAnd that is what George does playing the rave anthems that filled dancefloors across the country for the last two decadesAnd it is that very music that George will be showcasing when he plays the outdoor stage at this year's Coloursfest at Braehead Arena and Waterfront on Saturday June 6He said &quotI more or less start every GBX set with Concreate Angel or Bits n Pieces If I could pick a song I wish I had written it would be Concreate Angel&quotHis love for the Gareth Emery remixed track which features the vocal talents of Christina Novelli perhaps has more to do with the new direction George is heading in with his music  as a producerHe said &quotI am getting my head into producing I have done collaborations with other people but I've got my own studio now and I am doing lots of stuff myself I am also working with Scottish music producer John McLaughlin and his guys&quotI would love to do a track with Christina Novelli so I will definitely be seeking her out She would be perfect for my kind of thing&quotIt's this relentless work ethic of djing hosting radio shows and producing that caused George to feel unwell last yearHe gave his fans a fright when he unexpectedly came off air to go to hospital to deal with a mystery illnessHe said &quotI'm not a 100 per cent but I am much better than I was last year It was such a big fright and it was all down to sleep deprivation&quotI was just doing too much There was all these rumours about what happened to me like I had been stage diving I had a heart attack or I had a stroke&quotBut sleep deprivation caused my brain to shrink giving me crazy headaches I have spent 20 years on four or five hours sleep a night doing gigs and breakfast shows&quotHe added &quotWhen I went to hospital I was told to calm down a bit I had to cut back on the gigs although I still do them&quotMy Clyde bosses were brilliant They helped me out so much with the show I feel so much better now&quotWith him feeling a lot better the DJ can't wait to return to Coloursfest which is an event he has supported for over 10 yearsHe said &quotI have been doing Coloursfest from the start It is a great festival because when I interview DJs they always tell me the Scottish crowd is the best They have to be right as everyone is up for a party&quotThat party atmosphere at Coloursfest helped make tracks like Sol Fiesta's Spanglish become a GBX favouriteGeorge explained &quotMy favourite Coloursfest memory was actually three years ago when Sparkos who is on with me just done the Spanglish track with his band Sol Fiesta&quotHe said there is a lot of interest in this track Spanglish and I was like I don't know&quotI let him perform it at Coloursfest but told him I would put him on at the end&quotSo we played Spanglish and now it has become one of my most requested songs on the GBX&quotThe whole place just erupted and that song became a massive Scottish anthem and I think it was all down to that performance at Coloursfest&quotThe DJ admits he can't see himself completely giving up GBX saying &quotI would never give it up I will only give it up if people want me to I just love this too much at the moment&quotI probably won't do radio forever but I would love to do GBX for as long as possible&quotAnd it doesn't look like his fans will be letting him give up the show either&quotI can't leave the house without someone shouting &quotGive me a shout out Georgie boy&quot I love that they are just having a laugh&quotI also get so many people asking for selfies and I just love it&quotCatch George Bowie peforming his GBX Anthems at Coloursfest on Saturday June 6Tickets start at &pound4450 plus booking feeFor more information visit here

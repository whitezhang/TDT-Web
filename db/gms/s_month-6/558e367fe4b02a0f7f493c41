Protest to keep the Arches openPROTESTORS called for the Arches venue to be placed in public ownership during a lively protest outside Glasgow's seat of power.Artists and theatre bosses joined Arches staff and public supporters at John Street at 9am yesterday urging council bosses to re-instate the venue’s licence.A petition was handed to officials as a meeting of the council’s Licensing Committee got underway at 9.30am.Around 150 protestors chanted “Save Our Arches” and waved banners that read: “Don’t let cops close our club” and “Save Jobs, Save Arts, Save Clubs, Save Culture.”Mark Brown, a theatre critic for the Evening Times’ sister paper, the Sunday Herald, called for the venue to be placed into public ownership.He said: “The council say ‘people make Glasgow’. It’s all very well to use a slogan like that but actions speak louder than deed.”“The Arches belongs to the people of Glasgow.“We can’t allow the cops to be closing down one of the city’s most important cultural institutions.“Whatever the business model of the Arches is, the licence must be reinstated.“We don’t want the Arches to become a G1 venue. We don’t want to it to become a Wetherspoons.“This is a quarter of a century of culture. That should be celebrated by Glasgow City Council.“The idea that closing a club is going to stop anyone taking drugs is ridiculous.“We are in danger of losing one of the most important cultural institutions in the world.“It’s all very well for John Swinney to say he would do anything he could. We want to see substance to this.”He said that without venues such as the Arches, theatre by the likes of Kieran Wild and Cora Bisset - both supporters of the campaign, “would not exist.”Kieran Hurley,writer and theatre maker, joked that he was impressed to see so many ‘arches clientle’ present at the 9am demo.He shouted a series of questions at campaigners including: “Do we want to live in a city that protects its cultural institutions”, all answered with loud “Yes”.Glasgow based artists Joshua Brown called on the law makers to move towards an approach to drugs that focusses on “hard reduction”.He said that “pretending that drugs don’t exist” was not a way to keep people safe.He said: “It’s better to be aware of what is happening and look after each other.“We should be able to go to someone and get help and not be demonised.”“If we lose the venue, we lose an important part of what puts us on a world stage in terms of culture.“We will continue to fight until we get this venue re-opened.”He drew cheers from campaigners with the closing words: “Stefan King is not going to get this space.”The venue went into administration following a decision by the council to force the nightclub part of the operation to close at midnight.The ruling followed a series of police complaints about drug misuse and disorder.Police raised licensing issues last year after the drug-related death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl at the club and a number of other incidents.Campaigners pledged to stage further and bigger demonstrations in the next few weeks and urged supporters of the club to make their voices heard.Jodie Wilkinson, 32, a creative learning programmer, who is among the 129 people who lost their jobs, said: “People need culture. People need space.“The demise of the Arches is an outcome I never saw happening.“We just have to hold on to hope.”

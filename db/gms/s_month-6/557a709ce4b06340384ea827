By CAROLINE WILSONFORMER patients joined doctors and charity leaders to celebrate Glasgow's world-famous Yorkhill hospital.A celebratory event was held last night at the University of Strathclyde to mark the end of more than 100 years of medical history as the hospital closed its doors.Patients are in the process of being moved to new state-of-the-art facilities at the South Glasgow University Hospital.The event was organised by Yorkhill Children's Charity which has raised more than &pound;25million towards research services, equipment and support for families whose children are unwell.The charity contributed &pound;5million to enhance services at the new hospital.Professor Peter Watson, Chairman of YCC said Yorkhill's legacy of &quot;unrivalled care&quot; in Scotland would live on.He said: &quot;The Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow has touched the lives of millions of sick children since it opened its doors over 100 years ago.&quot;Known and loved by most simply as 'Yorkhill' - it has become a bastion of care, love and support for hundreds of thousands of sick children and their families from throughout Scotland and beyond.&quot;As an organisation we sit firmly at the heart of the hospital, working in partnership with the NHS to make the best even better.&quot;The true legacy of Yorkhill is first class care, unquestionable and unrivalled in Scotland.&quot;This legacy will live on at the new children's hospital through the vision of YCC, and with your support we can ensure that Scotland's sick children get the best care possible, care which is so desperately needed, but so rightly deserved.&quot;So much has been achieved and accomplished at Yorkhill and these achievements should be celebrated on nights like tonight, but for YCC our journey is only just beginning.&quot;A film was showing highlighting the achievements of the past and looking to the future of the charity's new home.The keynote speech was given by former Chief Medical Officer, Sir Harry Burns, who is now professor of global public health at the University of Strathclyde.He said: &quot;I couldn't turn down the opportunity to join the celebration of what has been a remarkable story over the past 100 years.&quot;We celebrate the sick children's hospital but I would like to see us to take the next step forward and celebrate a city of well children.&quot;Our destination is to have the best children's hospital in the world.&quot;The event also included a performance by the East Glasgow Music School Senior Vocal Ensemble.The hospital was originally completed at Garnethill in 1882 and opened on 20 December as the Hospital for Sick Children in 1882.The hospital was suffering from a chronic lack of space by the 1900s and as a result a new site at Yorkhill was chosen for the replacement hospital building.

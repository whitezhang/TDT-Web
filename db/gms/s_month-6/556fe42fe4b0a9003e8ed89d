PLANS for a hotline to deter young people from joining Islamic State have taken a step forward.Staff at Roshni will present proposals to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the Home Secretary Theresa May over the coming weeks in a bid to secure their support for a peer counselling hotline.The project aims to act as an emergency response for young Muslims affected by radicalisation and child sexual exploitation across the UK.It would ensure that callers in need of help are able to get information without having to reveal their location and personal details.As the Evening Times reported last Friday, the charity held a groundbreaking event in Glasgow last month to tackle the issues of child sexual exploitation (CSE) and radicalisation.It comes after Aqsa Mahmood, from Glasgow's Pollokshields, left Scotland for Syria in 2013 to become a so-called 'Jihadi bride' at the age of 19.It is estimated that around 700 Britons have travelled to Syria, with many thought to have joined IS.Ali Khan, executive chairman of Roshni, said the event called Exploiting, Exploited helped to give minority ethnic young people a voice and talk about the issues surrounding radicalisation and CSE.He said: &quot;It is clear following the event that these issues cannot be resolved from the bedroom, boardroom or the confines of Holyrood and Westminster.&quot;By taking this discussion on the road, and providing support to those that need it most, we will make meaningful progress in finding practical solutions to these problems.&quot;The Home Office welcomed the move.A spokeswoman said: &quot;We have a fundamental duty as a society to protect vulnerable individuals who may be at risk of exploitation and radicalisation in all forms.&quot;This Government is committed to supporting communities which are responding to the challenge of protecting those individuals.&quot;The Scottish Government declined to comment.

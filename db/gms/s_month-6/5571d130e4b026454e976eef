THREE whales have died and 10 others are stranded off the Isle of Skye.
The whales became stuck on rocks on Staffin Island off the northern coast earlier today.
A team from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) is tending to the stranded mammals.
A spokesman said: &quot;They are not in an easy position as they have stranded awkwardly on rocks, meaning it is difficult to relieve the pressure on their bodies.&quot;

The BDMLR was alerted to a pod of 21 pilot whales that had become stranded at Brogaig Bay on Skye at about 4am. More wildlife news
Rescuers said 18 were refloated before 10 became stranded again on Staffin Island.
Two whales died and a pregnant female who was not expected to survive was euthanised, the BDMLR said.
The pod was first spotted off Staffin at 4.30pm yesterday.

A GUITAR teacher says music has helped him recover from family losses and wants to encourage others to get the same benefit.
Christopher Fleming said the death of family members, particularly his father, John, have hurt and music kept him going.
The 27-year-old said: “He nurtured my gift when I was younger and when I was 19 he pushed me to be a guitar teacher. He said he was proud of me and to make music my main thing in life.”
Christopher, who said he has taught more than 1400 students and worked with 300 bands across Scotland, is keen for others to try music.
He said: “Pick up a guitar and write a song and put your thoughts and feelings on paper. I think music can take you away from pain and from reality. It gives you a sense of achievement and hope.
“I encourage students to write something that means something to them. 
“There’s too much negativity that we can’t do music as a career. But it helped my life after I lost so many of my family.”

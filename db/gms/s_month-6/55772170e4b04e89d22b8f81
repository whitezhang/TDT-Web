First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will host a reception in the United States later to thank supporters of the fire-damaged Glasgow School of Art (GSA).
The event in New York's Lincoln Centre Plaza will be attended by 200 guests, including GSA alumni and expatriates.
They will be told of plans to restore the Grade A-listed art nouveau Mackintosh building that was badly damaged in the blaze on 23 May 2014.
Ms Sturgeon is on a four-day visit to the US - her first as first minister.
Earlier, the first minister appeared on one of American television's top chat shows.
She took part in The Daily Show, hosted by Jon Stewart, and questioned her billing on the show's website as a &quot;comedian&quot;.
The GSA reception she will host aims to boost the profile of the Mackintosh appeal which hopes to raise &pound;20m towards the eventual cost of restoration of the building and its contents.
The New York event will also provide a platform for sharing details of the planned restoration project with existing and potential new supports. 
Patrons of the appeal include the American actor Brad Pitt as well as Scots actor and former GSA student Peter Capaldi.

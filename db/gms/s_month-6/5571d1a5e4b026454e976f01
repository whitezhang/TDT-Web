YOUNG Hoops superfan Jay Beatty led his own team yesterday in a charity match organised by Celtic Wag Lisa Hague.
Lisa, who’s engaged to Kris Commons, headed the opposition.
Players for Team Hague included X-Factor singer Nicholas McDonald. Former Scotland international Kevin Gallagher and ex-Celt Joe Miller were on the park for Team Beatty.
Jay’s boys won and the 11-year-old, who has Down’s Syndrome, was thrilled to lift the cup at Hamilton Accies’ New Douglas Park.
 

The event aided Downs and Proud, the Hamilton Community Trust and Simba, the charity for miscarriages and still births, which Lisa has supported since losing first daughter Lola.
Jay became a Celtic star when he was picked out of the crowd by Georgios Samaras to celebrate winning the league title.

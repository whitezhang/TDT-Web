Poverty level is still unacceptableTHE number of children in poverty in Scotland is unacceptable the Scottish Government admit as it laid the blame on the UK Government’s austerity agendaThe latest figures show 210,000 children in poverty, which is a decrease of 10,000 on the previous year but still far higher than two years ago when it was 190,000.Anti poverty campaigners welcomed the drop but warned that incomes were not rising in line with housing costs and too many were still in difficulty and said the Scottish Government needed to act as wellThe Poverty and Income Inequality report showed last year in total there were 940,000 living in relative poverty, defined as 60% below the median UK income.It is a fall on the previous year but again an increase since 2010/11 of 40,000 people and means 22% of children in Scotland are living in poverty.Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil said it was down to Westminster and the austerity agenda and welfare cuts.He said: “These unacceptable levels of child poverty in Scotland show the shocking reality of the UK Government’s austerity agenda.“Westminster’s approach of slashing budgets is having a damaging impact in Scotland with 210,000 children now living in relative poverty.“While these figures are inexcusable, I dread to think how many more people will be pushed into distress and despair as a direct result of the UK Government’s proposed &pound;12 billion cuts to the welfare budget.”The Poverty Alliance, which campaigns for a Living Wage to take people out of in-work poverty, said different figures excluding and including housing costs show that housing costs are rising faster than income and are taking up a growing share of household budgets.Peter Kelly, director of the Poverty Alliance said: “The number of people living in Scotland would fill Hampden Stadium over 18 times.“More must be done to tackle this to ensure that families have enough money to live a decent standard of living.“There are too many children in Scotland still growing up unsuitable housing, without enough to eat, and missing out on the things which many of us take for granted.”Mr Kelly said it was for both Holyrood and Westminster to focus on.He added: “Both governments need to take action to ensure that everyone in Scotland is afforded the best start in life.”The Poverty Truth Commission worked with the Scottish government on producing a response to the report.Elaine Downie, co-ordinator, said: “Too often people living in poverty are viewed as a problem or a series of problems, labelled as scroungers, benefits cheats and undeserving, people to be pitied or people to be blamed.“The opposite is true. People living in poverty are first and foremost people. People who may have been sanctioned, people on the minimum wage who may have to rely on food banks at the end of the month, people who may have to struggle every single day and people who understand their situation better than anyone else on the outside looking in.”

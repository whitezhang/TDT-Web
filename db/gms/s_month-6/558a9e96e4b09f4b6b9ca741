The secret army keeping Glasgow cleanCLEAN Glasgow keeps the city looking sensational.The organisation has been a cornerstone of our Streets Ahead campaign since we launched in 2011.This year, its blitz on communities all over Glasgow has had tremendous results, helping communities work together and inspiring individuals to get involved.In Townhead, Clean Glasgow supported residents carrying out a raft of tasks, from litter picking and cutting back shrub beds to sweeping up fallen leaves.Half a tonne of waste was swept from the streets, with two brand new bins supplied to help keep the area clean and free from litter.Around 40 pupils from St Mungo’s primary did their bit to clear pavements and public spaces and 120 metres of graffiti was removed from buildings, lampposts and litter bins in the area.The Clean Glasgow team visited businesses in Townhead to offer advice on how to best manage their waste.Elsewhere, Southside Central Area Partnership teamed up with Clean Glasgow’s Local Operational Working Group to deliver a number of south side clean-up events, after a neighbourhood survey revealed street cleanliness was the key area of concern for residents.More than 300 residents took part in the Southside Central Neighbourhood Management Survey, giving their thoughts on cleansing, road and pavement maintenance, private landlords and youth services.The Area Partnership has joined forces with Clean Glasgow, Keep Scotland Beautiful, Urban Roots, South Seeds, Asda, local schools and McDonald’s to deliver community led clean-ups in the areas that need it most.And in Govanhill, McDonald’s staff teamed up with pupils from Cuthbertson Primary, Annette Street Primary and Holy Cross Primary to collect rubbish from Govanhill Park.For more information on Clean Glasgow and how to get involved call 0300 343 7027 or visit www.cleanglasgow.org.uk.

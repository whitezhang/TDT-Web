EXCLUSIVEBy REBECCA GRAYCrime ReporterCRUNCHY gravel could be the key to thwarting thieves, according to city cops.Police are offering home security tips - including laying gravel under window ledges and on doorsteps - in a bid to reduce home raids.Instead of suggesting technology, such as CCTV or improved lighting, officers believe noisy gravel is the way to keep people safe.In a statement, police said: &quot;Gravel placed outside under window ledges and at doorsteps can be a good way to deter potential housebreakers.&quot;It comes amid a police crackdown on housebreakings across Glasgow.Extra officers in unmarked cars have been deployed over fears that thieves are targeting homes in several neighbourhoods.One police source said: &quot;Gravel can deter housebreakers as there is a risk that that they would be heard near the property, especially during the night.&quot;Detectives, meanwhile, believe the nationwide roll-out of Operation RAC, which stands for Recovery and Capture, has helped incidents of housebreaking reduce faster than almost any other offence in the city.Chief Superintendent Andy Bates, said housebreakings are a &quot;high priority&quot; for his officers.The local policing commander for Greater Glasgow said: &quot;Housebreaking is a despicable crime, and impacts on families and people from all walks of life.&quot;It is a high priority for Police Scotland.&quot;We'd like to remind householders that police are on hand to provide them with information on keeping their homes safe from intruders.&quot;The Evening Times previously revealed how householders were urged to plant thorny bushes to put off would-be intruders.Police said planting spiky and spiny shrubs makes homes more secure and less attractive to thieves.Defensive plants, including Hawthorn, Pyracantha and the fearsome sounding Firethorn, could help discourage thieves.The advice states: &quot;Ensure that your boundary fence is in good repair and constructed in a way that is difficult to climb.&quot;A good idea is to plant shrubs which are prickly, such as Berberis, Hawthorn and Pyracantha.&quot;This will help deter an intruder trying to enter your property.&quot;

Delays to motorway footbridge after sub-standard concrete discoveredA NEW footbridge over the M8 at Hillington has been delayed after it was discovered sub-standard concrete had been used.Further work is required on the concrete foundations of the structure which will need to completed before the new steel arch deck can be lifted into position.The contractor building the new bridge, GRAHAM Construction, carried out testing on the concrete finding that some of the concrete cast in the piers and bases was below industry standard.A spokesman from GRAHAM Construction, said: “Unfortunately some concrete supplied during the construction of the bridge abutments was not to the correct specification.“Thankfully, this was tested before the bridge installation and we are now in the process of replacing the concrete.“It is very disappointing that this will cause a delay to the completion of the project, but it’s vital for the local community that we ensure their bridge performs to the highest standards for decades to come.”Work on the new footbridge will restart in early July with the new bridge expected to be open to the public in September.Gordon Wilson, contract director said: “Everything possible is being done to ensure that the Hillington footbridge replacement project is completed as soon as possible and I apologise in advance to the local community and motorists for any disruption caused by the delay to the project.”Scotland Transerv, on behalf of Transport Scotland is currently overseeing the works.

FROZEN star Idina Menzel melted the heart of little Amy Carmichael by duetting with her backstage at a gig.
Amy, 10, sang the film’s anthem Let It Go with Idina, who was the voice of Elsa in the Disney movie and has also starred as Shelby Corcoran in TV’s Glee.
Amy,  who was diagnosed with acute   lymphoblastic leukaemia in 2012 but has been in remission for eight months, said: “I am so happy.
“It was exciting and Idina was  so nice. My friends won’t believe me. I’m going to tell them all.”
Idina, who was worried about passing on her cold, was performing at Glasgow’s Royal Concert Hall.
 

She suggested a duet after hearing how Amy, of Stonehouse, Lanarkshire , loves to sing.
The singer told her: “You have a higher voice than me and you should definitely pursue singing.”
 

Mum Heather said: “It was a dream come true. Idina seemed very touched when she heard that one of Amy’s friends had passed on last August and that she was going to sing Let It Go in his memory at a ball this November.”
She thanked Les Hoey and his Dreammaker Foundation who set up the meeting. www.leshoeymbedreammakerfoundation.org/

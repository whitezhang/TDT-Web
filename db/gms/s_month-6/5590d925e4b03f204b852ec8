You couldn't ask for better neighbours.&quot;I can't imagine what their son must be thinking right now.Prayers were said in tribute to the couple as the congregation of their local church gathered on Sunday morning.Reverend Joyce Keyes of Abronhill Parish Church, where the Anchor Boys and Boys' Brigade met, said: &quot;They were extremely important to the church community here.&quot;Jim was an elder with the church and the captain of the Boys' Brigade and his loss must impact on the wider community.&quot;I knew them very well. They were friends of mine as well as members of the church.&quot;They took part in services here. Jim would play guitar and Ann was a beautiful singer.&quot;They're going to be very dreadfully missed not just by their family but also by their church family.&quot;Jim had been working extremely hard with the Boys' Brigade for years and would rush over after work on a Friday to help out.&quot;The family of a couple from Perth who haven't been heard from since the tragedy are facing anxious wait for news.Billy and Lisa Graham, were holidaying in the busy resort of Sousse when the lone gunman used an automatic weapon to open fire on sunbathing tourists.Daughter Holly Graham is keeping a vigil by the phone and has criticised a lack of information from the Foreign Office and tour operator Thomson.Three generations of one family from the West Midlands are among those caught up in the killing spree.Joel Richards, 19, and his uncle, Adrian Evans, who is in his 40s, died together.Mr Richards' grandfather, Patrick Evans, 78, is also feared dead, while his 16-year-old brother Owen survived.Adrian Evans worked as a manager in the gas services department of Sandwell Council in the West Midlands.Council leader Darren Cooper said he was &quot;a very popular and long-serving employee&quot;.Joel Richards, who played for Birmingham County FA, was described by the football club as &quot;a young, talented referee&quot;.

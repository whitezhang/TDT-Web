RANGERS are running the rule over ex-Manchester City defender Reece Wabara.
Ibrox boss Mark Warburton is continuing his rebuilding of the squad by assessing the England Under-20 star.
Wabara arrived in Glasgow over the weekend and will train with the top-team squad squad this week at Murray Park with a view to landing a deal.
 
Glasgow! Long drive ahead!

The 23-year-old right back quit Doncaster Rovers in the summer and has been pinpointed by Warburton.
Wabara was a former Development Squad skipper at City and had spells at Ipswich, Blackpool and Oldham before joining Rovers on a permanent contract last term.
Rangers have also secured a deal to sign 17-year-old striker Jordan Gibson from FC Alvechurch.

FIRST Minister Nicola Sturgeon lived up to her billing as a “comedian” in an American chat show.
In a series of brisk exchanges with comic Jon Stewart on the Daily Show, Sturgeon fended off the threat of America invading Scotland for its oil.
And she sailed through the interview even after she was compared to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
Sturgeon joked that she had “ordered an inquiry” into why the SNP won only 56 of Scotland’s 59 parliamentary seats.
 

Stewart replied: “You think you’re Saddam Hussein? You get 99%?”
“I think you should always aim for more,” she fired back.
The late night interview on Comedy Central came during Sturgeon’s four-day trip to New York and Washington.

Stewart’s staff accidentally described Ms Sturgeon as “a comedian” in the show’s billing, which she took in her stride.
She said: “You raised all these expectations that I’d be funny but I’m a politician. And as you know politicians are rarely very funny.”
Stewart replied: “You need not worry: they thought I was going to be funny for 17 years.”
The conversation turned to more serious matters as Stewart asked the First Minister about haggis
After Sturgeon said that Scotland could achieve economic independence based partly on its oil supplies, Stewart paused for a moment and asked: “May we invade you?”
She put the question to bed by replying: “You don’t usually ask permission.”
A spokesman for the Scottish government said: “The First Minister is in the United States where she is undertaking a series of business and government meetings that will promote Scotland as an attractive place to live, visit, study and invest and The Daily Show is an ideal opportunity to do exactly that and reach out to even more Americans across the country.”

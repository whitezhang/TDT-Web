GLASGOW is creating its own version of the recently closed love lock bridge in France.The Tradeston Bridge, better known as the squiggly bridge, now has almost 150 padlocks attached to it as couples symbolically show their love.One romantic Sharon Louden, 39, from Ibrox had last week placed her padlock and returned to touch it up.She said: &quot;I saw it on television and came and put mine on last week, the bad weather meant that the message ran off in the rain, so I've come back with a permanent marker.&quot;It's for my partner Mark. I had seen the other padlocks and thought I'd get a big, bright one so it stood out.&quot;Passersby have noticed the trend from walking over the bridge and while most agree that it has made the area more interesting they have mixed views about participating themselves.Chris Breen, 29, from Springburn said: &quot;I walk over this bridge every day, I have seen them build up, it's a great idea and a good expression of love.&quot;When asked if he would consider adding one himself he replied with &quot;I'm romantic but not that romantic.&quot;However, Aaminah Toufique, 19, from East Kilbride said: &quot;It's a great idea, I'd consider it, and I'm going to bring my boyfriend.&quot;We don't have anything like that in Glasgow, I think it symbolises love and community.&quot;Iraida Ramires, 49, from Mexico, in Glasgow for a conference, said it was also something she would consider doing.She said: &quot;It's nice, a good idea which could encourage people like me to come as tourists.&quot;The famous Pont des Artes bridge has this week had the millions of padlocks removed after concerns that the weight was making the bridge unsafe.The Tradeston Bridge had padlocks on it before the removal of the ones in Paris but since the announcement has seen a resurgence in those keen to place their locks.Robert Kearney, 26, and Laura Rooney, 25, both from Dublin took the opportunity to place their lock in Paris to symbolise their engagementMr Kearney said: &quot;They do it in Dublin too. People put them on a landmark bridge so they get taken down pretty quickly but there is a good chance it could catch on here in Glasgow.&quot;Not everyone was convinced that Glasgow was the best place for it, saying the city was not typically romantic, but many admired it as a good way to express love and were glad people were getting involved.Henk Vos, 34, from Shawlands said: &quot;It's an artistic thing to do and seeing it does make you think of the bridge in Paris. I understand why they were taken away there but the padlocks should still be kept, they're art.&quot;Words 456

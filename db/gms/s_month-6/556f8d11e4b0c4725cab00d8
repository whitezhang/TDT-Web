 Stewart Regan has spoken of his &quot;embarrassment&quot; at the scenes at the final whistle of Motherwell's Premiership play-off win over Rangers. 
 The Scottish Football Association's chief executive was in the Fir Park stand and witnessed the brawl between Bilel Mohsni and Lee Erwin and the pitch invasion by the home support. 
 &quot;I was at the match with my wife and all I can say is it was an utter embarrassment,&quot; he told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;It's not what you want to see.&quot; 
 Rangers defender Mohsni lashed out at Erwin when the Motherwell striker pushed him in the back for refusing to shake hands after the match. 
 The Tunisia international, who has since left Rangers, was on Tuesday banned for four games, while Motherwell duo Lionel Ainsworth and Craig Moore have been banned for two games each for violent conduct towards Mohsni. 
 Erwin was booked by referee Craig Thomson after the game for his part in the melee. 
 Police on horseback were used to quell the situation when Motherwell fans ran on to the pitch to celebrate the victory and a large group gathered to taunt the visiting supporters still in the stand. 
 &quot;It was embarrassing for the players involved, it was embarrassing for the managers and also for the clubs and fans,&quot; Regan told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound. 
 &quot;I can't remember the last time I saw mounted policemen on a football pitch. 
 &quot;It must be going back to the '70s or '80s, and that's not something I want to see in Scottish football. 
 &quot;It was an embarrassment. It will be dealt with - the compliance officer has issued a complaint and there will be appropriate action taken. 
 &quot;The responsibility for the match itself falls to the SPFL. I am aware they are discussing the matter, and they may well choose to carry out their own review of what went on. 
 &quot;We will deal with the on the field activity as far as players are concerned.&quot;

Teenage sports champion says he lost out on employment opportunities because of his ethnicityA TEENAGE sports champion said he was held back in finding employment because of his ethnicity.Joseph Amouzou, Scotland's under-20s triple jump event champion, said he and his white, Scottish friend would hand out CVs together but despite have the same qualifications, only his friend was called back for an interview.The 19-year-old athlete, who was born in Togo before moving to Glasgow aged 4 and now lives in Springburn, was left struggling to find work for a year - which Joseph says is not uncommon.He said: &quot;Most of my friends from ethnic minority backgrounds have not managed to achieve their goals. In fact, only one has a job.&quot;I was at college, but getting a job was definitely my goal.&quot;A white, Scottish friend and I would go out together looking for work.&quot;We would hand in our CVs, But even though we had the same qualifications, he got the calls.&quot;I thought putting my picture on my CV would show I’m smart and presentable.&quot;But then I started to wonder if having my picture - and name - on my CV made the difference.&quot;The teenager, who studied at Bellahouston Academy's Glasgow School of Sport and is fluent in English and French, has now obtained a Commonwealth Apprenticeship with North Glasgow Housing Association after competing around the world.He said: &quot;I don’t feel like I encountered any barriers during my school years.&quot;There were lots of people at Bellahouston Academy from a range of different ethnic backgrounds and I never felt we were treated differently.&quot;The problems started when I left school.&quot;My mum suggested getting in touch with African Challenge Scotland and it made a huge, positive difference.&quot;For the first time I was able to meet people from African countries and learn more about African cultures.&quot;African Challenge Scotland told me about the Commonwealth Apprenticeship and encouraged me to apply.&quot;It was very competitive, but they supported me all the way.&quot;There were only six places - I was thrilled to be chosen.&quot;The news comes as Holyrood's Equal Opportunities Committee launches an enquiry into race, ethnicity and employment after a report showed &quot;persistent inequalities&quot; by ethnicity of those in employment, self-employment or unemployment and a Scottish Census in 2011 showed similar results.Margaret McCulloch MSP, Convener of the Equal Opportunities Committee said: “If you come from an ethnic minority background, and want to access the same job opportunities many people take for granted, the Committee understand you can face significant barriers.&quot;Crucially we want to hear about what measures are being taken – and what still needs to happen - to create a level playing field.”The official date for submitting evidence to the Committee is June 30, however, the Committee are trying to be flexible to allow more people to do so.

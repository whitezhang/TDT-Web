Aberdeen hotels reported double-digit drops in both room yield and occupancy in April, a new survey from accountants BDO suggests.
BDO said low oil prices had served to push occupancy in Aberdeen hotels down 11.5 per cent compared with last year to 68.9 per cent on average, with room yield – the industry measure of revenue – down 12.1 per cent to average &pound;62.99.
Aberdeen hotels had also reported a 3.2 per cent fall in occupancy in March and a 5.2 per cent dip in room yields, which was described as a “further decline” for hotels in the Granite City.
In contrast, Edinburgh hotels reported a 7.9 per cent increase in occupancy year-on-year to average 80.4 per cent, with room yields also rising 10.2 per cent to average &pound;57.93.
In Glasgow, hotels reported occupancy rose 0.9 per cent year-on-year in April to average 80.6 per cent and average room yields rose 14.2 per cent to &pound;51.46.
Hotels in Inverness also recorded a 7.5 per cent year-on-year rise in average occupancy in April, to 78.3 per cent with average room yields up 20.7 per cent to &pound;49.83.
BDO said the downturn in Aberdeen had “impacted on the total Scottish figures”, which rose “just 1.1 per cent in occupancy to 75.4 per cent and had a 5.3 per cent rise in revenue to &pound;51.53”.
Those figures compare with regional UK, where average occupancy rose 1.4 per cent to 74.6 per cent, with hotels in England reporting an average increase of 1.2 per cent to 74.3 per cent and hotels in Wales reporting a 3.4 per cent increase to 77 per cent. #
Average room yields in regional UK in April was up 8.8 per cent to &pound;46.05, up 8.9 per cent in England to &pound;45.00 and up 13.6 per cent in Wales to &pound;41.12.
Alastair Rae, a partner in BDO's property, leisure and hospitality division, said: “The continued uncertainty in the oil and gas sector is still having a serious impact on the hotel sector in Aberdeen.
“Double digit drops in both occupancy and revenue, at a time when the rest of the sector in Scotland experienced a double digit increase in revenue indicates that the fall is specific to the oil industry.”
“It should be noted that occupancy and revenue levels in Aberdeen are falling from the very high levels achieved last year but it is clear that this is becoming part of a trend in the granite city which needs to react immediately by monitoring costs, cutting expenses where possible, and keeping prices competitive.”
Rae added: “The first four months have seen one of the most positive starts to 2015 for many years as there are now clear signs that the hospitality sector is recovering to pre-recession levels.
“With the exception of Aberdeen I believe that this year will see Scottish hotels experience very high levels of occupancy and revenue and a return to good levels of profitability.”
BDO's hotel trends survey has been published since the early 1970s and features a broad range of hotels in the three to four-star categories.

A GROUP of residents have been verbally abused and had their property damaged by dangerous drivers who plague their street whilst dropping off their kids at two nearby schools.Neighbours on Glen Orchy Drive say they are &quot;fed up&quot; with the drivers repeatedly blocking or parking within their driveways and destroying property, such as gates and plant pots, while they drop off their children at Darnley and St Angela's Primary.The &quot;extremely aggressive&quot; drivers also block the entrance to the one way street leaving residents fearing emergency vehicles would not be able to access the area if required.Betty Russell, 74, who has lived on the street for 15 years, said: &quot;We had an emergency here and fortunately it was a Saturday but if it was not, they would not have been able to get along the street.&quot;It is terrifying, when you say something to them they are really aggressive.&quot;I am here on my own and I have to put large plant pots across my driveway to stop them from parking in it and when my daughters are coming to visit I have to go out and move them.&quot;But my daughters will not come near my house during school hours.&quot;However, when confronted by tenants the drivers are &quot;rude&quot; and do not respond to the tenants pleas to move their cars, with some said to be driving illegally to ensure a parking space.Helena Smart, 48, said: &quot;My son was going to school along a foot path and a black car came up on to the foot path and he had to jump out of the way.&quot;It was just by luck that he managed to hear and catch some of their licence plate.&quot;But when I spoke to the driver they became aggressive like it was his fault.&quot;It will take some drastic to happen for this to be stopped.&quot;Councillor Rashid Hussain has backed the residents move for change.He said: &quot;Due to ongoing parking issues at the St Angela's primary school the residents living around the school are getting more frustrated.&quot;The residents find it hard to drive into their street, even finding that their driveways have been blocked by inconsiderate parents.&quot;The roads team at the council have conducted a survey of the area but in order to make these changes a road traffic order needs to be raised and this consultation can take 6-18 months.&quot;In order to speed up the process I am helping to mobilise the residents and parents from the schools to form the Darnley Community Council.&quot;This forum will ensure that the consultation is carried out at the correct level and that all the relevant departments involved to ensure that we can implement the road safety changes needed to protect our children and relieve the frustration of the residents.&quot;As previously reported in The Evening Times, parent council members from both primary schools have told of their fears that a child &quot;will be killed&quot; because of other parents dangerous driving.

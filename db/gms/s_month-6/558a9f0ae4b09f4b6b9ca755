Young musicians have a blast in high school orchestraMOVING up to high school can be a daunting prospect for even the bravest 11-year-old.But one forward-thinking South Lanarkshire secondary has come up with an innovative way of helping them cope.ANN FOTHERINGHAM reports.MORE than 100 young musicians took to the stage at Duncanrig Secondary’s summer concert – and unusually for a high school, some of them were as young as nine.The East Kilbride school has not uncovered a raft of child prodigies, however – instead, it’s all part of an innovative orchestra project designed to encourage more young people into music AND help them adjust to the brave new world of high school.The Primary Partner Orchestra is the brilliant invention of Duncanrig staff, including head of music Jane Ramsay and brass tutor Douglas Campbell.“Douglas, who is one of South Lanarkshire Council’s instrumental music service tutors, came up with the idea of bringing primary school pupils into our school to rehearse and perform together,” explains Mrs Ramsay.“I thought it was a brilliant idea, took it to our head teacher George Wynne and he was instantly supportive, and we got it off the ground.”The children come up to the high school once a week to rehearse with Duncanrig pupils and it culminates with a performance at the summer concert in front of parents and friends.Eight years on, the numbers have stayed steady (54 children from almost all nine of Duncanrig’s feeder primaries took part this year) and the repertoire gets bigger and more ambitious every time.Duncanrig Secondary has a successful music department, as Mrs Ramsay explains.“When I first came to Duncanrig in 2003, we were finding pupils were enthusiastic about learning an instrument at primary school but as soon as they came up to secondary, it was no longer cool to be in to music,” she says.“The idea of starting up the concert band, and encouraging the pupils to be part of different groups and ensembles was to show them it is cool to be musical. After all, they can do something other people can’t and that is something to be proud of.”Now Duncanrig’s senior concert band is an awardwinner, picking up the prestigious gold prize at this year’s National Concert Band Festival. The school’s popular senior ceilidh and folk band has won several accolades, including first place in the folk category of the Glasgow Music Festival for the last three years.The school also boasts a chamber collective, percussion ensemble, junior ceilidh band and guitar group, the latter taught by sixth year pupil and new school captain Emma Clark.“Many of the pupils in these awardwinning groups came through the primary partner orchestra,” says Mrs Ramsay, who is hoping to continue to expand the orchestra and add a primary partner choir.But while the primary partner orchestra has also played its part in Duncanrig’s musical success, it can also take credit for helping its young recruits adjust to the often daunting experience of high school.“The pupils who come to the orchestra get used to the building, start to know faces of both older pupils and teachers, and that makes a huge difference when they come here as first years,” says Mrs Ramsay.“We find they lose some of their fears about starting high school, and are more confident and relaxed when they start with us after the summer holidays.“It’s also great for the senior pupils who act as mentors, obtaining valuable leadership experience.”Sixth year pupils Callum Neil, 17, Orla Jenkins, 16 and Iona Jackson, 16, are all accomplished musicians who took their first steps as part of the primary partner orchestra.“It makes a big difference knowing the building and some of the teachers when you come up to high school,” says Orla, who plays the flute.“It’s good to have that when you are coming from a small primary school into a big school like Duncanrig. It can be quite scary.”Callum, who plays the trumpet, agrees. “The orchestra really helps you overcome the challenge of fitting in,” he says. “You want to be like the bigger pupils, so you aspire to play as well as they can.”For Auldhouse Primary pupils Callum Smith, nine, Hannah Smith, 10 and 11-year-old Archie Wallace, being part of the primary partner orchestra at Duncanrig has been a valuable experience.“Duncanrig feels like a really big place when you come in and I was nervous the first time,” says Callum, who plays the trombone.“It’s hard going from playing in front of your own school to performing on stage in front of a massive crowd. But you feel much better after a few weeks and it’s been great.”Archie, who plays the French horn, has attended the orchestra for two years and will start at Duncanrig in August.“The best thing about it is the friendships you make with people from other schools you wouldn’t normally meet,” he says. “It’s also good to learn your way about, so you don’t get lost.”Auldhouse Primary’s head teacher Janie Niven said: “The orchestra is worth its weight in gold. As well as giving young people the chance to perform as part of an orchestra, which gives them a tremendous sense of achievement, it is a fantastic way to help them prepare for secondary education.“Jane Ramsay has really tailored the programme cleverly so that even younger musicians, and those who have just started learning their instruments, can join in.“It’s a brilliant programme, giving young musicians the chance to feel they are part of something and that really helps them have a positive start to their high school experience.”Duncanrig head teacher George Wynne said he believes the initiative could be the first of its kind in Scotland.“We’re thrilled by the success of our orchestra, which is a one-off as far as we know in South Lanarkshire and perhaps in the whole country,” he explains. “It is fantastic for us from a musical point of view, as the young musicians no longer give up their instruments on reaching high school, and they are much more competent players.“But it is also a huge benefit to pupils, helping to take the stress and fear out of the transition to high school.”

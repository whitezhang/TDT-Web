POLICE are searching for a 13-year-old girl who has been missing for three days after telling her father that she was going for a walk.
Brogan Mearns was last seen at about 6pm on Saturday at her father’s home in Tormusk Road in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow.
Police said the teenager has gone missing before but they are “very concerned about her well-being”.
She told her father that she was going for a walk but never returned, officers said.
Brogan is about 5ft 4ins and of medium build, with blue eyes and black shoulder length hair. She was last seen wearing blue skinny jeans and a purple hooded top.
Constable Stuart Adams said: “Brogan has gone missing before but we are all very concerned about her well-being particularly due to her age.
“I would appeal to anyone that recognises Brogan or knows where she is to contact police immediately.
“I would also encourage Brogan to let someone know that she is safe - she is not in any trouble, we just want to know that she is safe.
“Anyone with information can contact police via the non-emergency number 101.”

A man and a woman have been jailed for stabbing a friend and then dumping his body in the River Clyde in Glasgow and leaving him to drown.
Kevin Caughey, 33, and Margaret McKellar, 31, admitted killing 41-year-old Scott McGuire at the suspension bridge at Carlton Place on 8 July 2014.
The attack happened after Mr McGuire hit McKellar with a bottle. 
Caughey was jailed for eight years and one month and McKellar for six years and four months.
Jailing the pair at the High Court in Glasgow, judge John Beckett QC told them: &quot;This senseless killing of a man of 41 has left his family bereaved. He is survived by his father and four grown-up children. 
&quot;While I accept he may have triggered the attack by initially using violence, you reacted with wanton violence. 
&quot;Mr McGuire was repeatedly struck on the head and body with a knife and pushed into the river where he hit his head on a rock. You left the scene doing nothing to help him yourself or seek help for him.&quot; 
The court heard that the incident was sparked by a row which led to Mr McGuire hitting McKellar with a bottle. 
The pair then attacked Mr McGuire, inflicting superficial stab wounds.
The victim hit his head on a rock as he was pushed in to the River Clyde and drowned. His body was found later that day.
Caughey and McKeller were originally charged with murder, but their plea of guilty to the reduced charge of culpable homicide was accepted by the Crown. 
It emerged in court that Caughey has 74 previous convictions, including seven for possessing a weapon, and McKellar has 60 previous convictions, including assault.

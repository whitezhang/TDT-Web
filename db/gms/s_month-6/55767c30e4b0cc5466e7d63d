KIND hearted people who want to help others will find it easier to volunteer for city council run projects.During the Commonwealth Games more than 1200 people gave up their time to be Host City Volunteers while 15,000 worked as Clydesiders.Their part in making the Games the best ever has prompted more people in the city to volunteer.But figures show there is a gap in Glasgow between the number of people who want to volunteer and the number of quality opportunities available.Today, new plans were launched which set out to create more chances to volunteer with the city council and its arms length organisations like Culture and Sport Glasgow, the Marketing Bureau, the Royal Concert Hall and Cordia which provides catering and home care.Under the new policy, volunteers will have clear rights and responsibilities, will not be left out of pocket and will receive appropriate support.The council also hopes to encourage young people under the age of 16 and asylum seekers to become volunteers.Special efforts will be made to recruit volunteers from all backgrounds including more professional people.One scheme involves mainly retired professionals mentoring young people living in the most disadvantaged areas of the city who are interested in going on to higher education but may not have access to the necessary knowledge and advice to realise their dream.Volunteer mentors aim to support, challenge and inspire young people and meet them informally after school for one to one support.This can be helping them find a career, selecting university courses, gaining work experience, helping plan for study and exams and dealing with pressure at home or in school.Hilary and Robert Murdoch have been involved with the project in Springburn Academy since it was set up four years ago.Retired doctor Hilary said: &quot;I listen to what their aspirations are, what their difficulties are and I help them work through that to achieve their ambitions.&quot;Her husband Robert, a statistician, said: &quot;We try to help the young people develop the skills of problem solving, giving them our knowledge and experience to map out a plan of action to tackle things.&quot;City council deputy leader Archie Graham said the new policy was not about replacing staff with volunteers.He added: &quot;These new opportunities will be things that wouldn't ordinarily have been undertaken if it were not for volunteers.&quot;It is about recognising there is a demand from people who want to volunteer for a whole host of reasons and about helping to fill that gap to benefit the individuals, our local communities and society as a whole.&quot;We want to foster a mutually beneficial relationship with volunteers where they can bring new skills and perspective to us while fulfilling their volunteering ambitions.&quot;The added bonus is that or organisation will also benefit from the wealth and breadth of views, skills and experience the volunteers will bring with them.&quot;For more information on mentoring visit www.intergenerationalmentoring.com

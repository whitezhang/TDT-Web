The Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill has begun the process of moving to its new home in Glasgow.
The accident and emergency department closed at 08:00 and has transferred to the new Royal Hospital for Sick Children at the &pound;842m southern campus. 
As part of a phased move, inpatients, outpatient services and day surgery will transfer over the next four days.
The southern campus also contains the city's other new hospital - the South Glasgow University Hospital for adults.
Robert Calderwood, chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: &quot;The new adult acute hospital and new Royal Hospital for Sick Children have been a long time in the planning and construction, and I am delighted that they are now complete. 
&quot;The new Royal Hospital for Sick Children has been designed to the make any child's visit to the hospital as pleasant as possible with a cinema, science centre, interactive activity walls, indoor and outdoor play areas and a roof garden.
&quot;We hope that the children who move to the new hospital this week are as pleased with it as we are.&quot;

GREGOR TOWNSEND has told Glasgow Warriors fans the club have already started preparing for their Pro12 title defence by bringing the players back early.
The head coach was speaking as more than 1500 supporters gathered at George Square to celebrate the stunning 31-13 win over Munster in the final two weeks ago.
 Townsend reckons the shortened break ahead of the new campaign can give his team the edge on  their rivals. 
He said: “We do things differently and next season started yesterday so that was a 10-day break but we’ll have time off again in July.
“We did it last year and it worked really well. We want to build on that because the guys were fitter and stronger.
“We have to make sure there isn’t a comedown. As coaches and players we need to work harder than we did before.

“What we’ve achieved is down to effort and we looked stronger and fitter in the second half of games and that was down to the work we did in pre-season and during the campaign.”
Townsend has been in charge of Glasgow since 2012 and says becoming the first Scottish team to win the Pro12 was always the aim. But he laughed off suggestions a European title is the next step despite being named top seeds for next week’s Champions Cup draw.
The 42-year-old said: “We had it as a goal to become the first Scottish team to win the title. In the first year we lost in the semi-final to Leinster then in the second year we made the final.
“A lot of why it didn’t work last year can be put down to me. We focused on the occasion too much and I learned a big lesson from that.
“This year we knew we had to focus on the game and there was a calmness and confidence about us.
“It’s not a case of looking to Europe now, it’s just to be better. We were seeded first last year and still got Bath, Montpellier and Toulouse so we’ll have three great sides in our group.”

A PENSIONER is suing the NHS after claiming doctors unnecessarily amputated his legs.
Walter Watson, 69, says he went into hospital for an operation for ulcers and came round to find both legs gone.
He said: “You can imagine the shock when I awoke to find half of me was missing.
“I had no idea I was going to lose my legs.”
Walter believes he could have avoided the amputations if he had been given prompt and proper treatment for leg ulers.
 

He claims he attended several outpatient appointments about the ulcers but nothing was done.
He then became seriously ill with an infection.
Thompsons Solicitors said they have reports from independent experts which say other treatments should have been tried before Walter’s amputations.
The pensioner said: “I was looking forward to my retirement. It’s gone. I’m very restricted where I can go.”

When Walter, of Aberdeen, went in for surgery in 2013, he thought he was going to have an angioplasty – an operation to widen blocked arteries.
He claims he has no memory of signing a pre-surgery consent form allowing leg amputation.
Walter is suing NHS Grampian, who say amputations are only carried out as a last resort.
But solicitor Nicola Kelly said: “It is the experts’ view that, had he received the appropriate prompt treatment, he wouldn’t have needed the double amputation.
“Mr Watson had been going back and forwards to the hospital and was repeatedly discharged with no appropriate treatment or follow-up.”
NHS Grampian said they could not comment on Walter’s case.
A spokeswoman added: “Speaking generally, we do our utmost to prevent our vascular patients reaching the point where amputation is necessary.
“If amputation is the only option, we are absolutely committed to returning the patient to an independent life.
“We are confident that we offer a high standard of care to our patients.”

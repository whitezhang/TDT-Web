 RADIO station Heart Scotland has been slammed after a foulmouthed conversation was broadcast to listeners. 
 Presenters Robin Galloway and Adele Cunningham found themselves in hot water in February after their morning show finished at 10am and whilst they were recording new content for another show. 
During a news bulletin they were heard chatting about circumcision and as it finished co-presenter Adele was heard saying“… Oh it’s a shame that flat’s away. S***. Motherf***er”.”
After one person officially complained, owners Global said it had not intended to broadcast the offensive language and broadcast an apology soon after.

Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom yesterday ruled that listeners would not have expected to hear offensive language broadcast at this time of day. They said it broke Rule 2.3 of the broadcasting code.
After the mistaken broadcast the station had told listeners: “Just want to apologise, due to some technical problems that left the studio live on air earlier, some listeners in the east of Scotland may have heard some content that shouldn’t have been broadcast and we sincerely apologise for any offence caused”.
The station acknowledged that the conversation contained “inappropriate language that clearly was not suitable for broadcast in this context”. It added that it was “taking the incident very seriously” and had “reminded the presenters via formal letter of its station policy that all discussions in a studio should be suitable for broadcast”.

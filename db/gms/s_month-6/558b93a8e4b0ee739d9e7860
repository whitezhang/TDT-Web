Ageing Labour needs young blood warns DugdaleLABOUR is an ageing party and will die unless it attracts new younger members Kezia Dugdale said.The leadership contender gave her stark warning during a hustings even in Glasgow.Ms Dugdale is standing against Ken Macintosh to replace Jim Murphy.She said: “Our party and vote in Scotland is ageing. If we don’t accept that and do something about it our party will die with that generation, It’s that serious.”Mr Dugale said that Labour had to win back Glasgow if it was to recover and win back power following the General Election defeat.”She said: “&quot;The Scottish Labour Party was founded in Glasgow.&quot;We won't be able to get back on our feet without this great city's support.&quot;To put it bluntly, Labour won't win again without winning in Glasgow.&quot;The General Election wipeout we suffered here was years in the making.&quot;Despite the hard work of our candidates, councillors and activists, the majority of people in Glasgow had decided who they wanted to represent their hopes and aspirations - and it wasn't Labour.&quot;The writing was on the wall back in 2011, but we didn't do enough to allow people in Glasgow to put their trust in us again.Mr Macintosh took a swipe at Holyrood cliques and party hierarchies and warned the party had to change direction.He also said Labour had to change the way it campaigned and make more use of new techniques.He said he was not a career politician.The East Renfrewshire MSP said: “Mt constituents don’t gain anything from me having a glass of wine in the Holyrood bars.“I’m not a career politician.“You’re more likely to find me of an evening folding washing or matching socks.”Ms Dugdale and Alex Rowley for deputy won support from Unison Labour members.UNISON Scotland Labour Link Chair Gordon McKay said: “Scottish Labour needs to change direction, start listening to its friends and pursue policies that will win the support of working people.“The old politics simply won’t do. We believe they will make a good team. Kezia will provide energetic leadership and Alex offers experience and commitment. They have both shown they are prepared to take Scottish Labour out of its comfort zone.”

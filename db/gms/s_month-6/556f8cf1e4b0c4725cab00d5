 Kilmarnock have signed midfielder Scott Robinson after the 23-year-old was released by promoted Hearts. 
 He has agreed a three-year contract to join up with Gary Locke, who was his manager at Tynecastle. 
 Locke said: &quot;I am over the moon to have signed Scott. He is a tenacious player, great on the ball and makes good runs from the midfield.&quot; 
 Robinson made 115 appearances for Hearts, but only eight of those came this season. 
 The former Scotland Under-19 international said: &quot;I am looking forward to working with the manager again. 
 &quot;This is a new challenge for me and I am ready for it.&quot;

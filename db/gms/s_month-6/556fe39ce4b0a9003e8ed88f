A 117-year-old church on Glasgow's South Side is being celebrated in story and song.St Margaret's Episcopal Church in Newlands secured Historic Scotland funding restore the building's historic organ, from 1924, and to develop an oral history project.Hundreds of objects were donated to the scheme and more than 50 interviews were recorded, detailing congregants' memories of the building.Mary Johnson-Symington, the project's heritage officer, said: &quot;It has been incredible to see the positive impact the project has had on everyone who has participated.&quot;Not only has it led to capturing some very rare history, especially from one lady whose grandparents were founder members of St Margaret's back in 1898, it has also brought people back to the church who long since moved away.&quot;The project really caught people's imagination and we were inundated with fabulous offers of donations and personal testimonies about the church.&quot;Without the help of our dedicated team of volunteers who conducted interviews and cataloguing, we couldn't have completed the project and we are extremely grateful to them.&quot;Story and Song: the Heritage of St Margaret's saw around 400 items of personal significance donated to the archive and more than 1300 minutes of oral histories were recorded.Among the objects on display are a ceremonial brass jug, the mallet used to lay the church's foundation stone in 1911 and a beautifully sculpted marble maquette which is an exact scale model of the original font of St Margaret's built in 1912.The highlights of the collection of images, objects and interviews are now being brought together in an exhibition being staged in the church from June 8 to 13.It will then be at Kelvingrove Museum &amp; Art Gallery from August 3 to 30.Reverend Canon Dr Scott Robertson, Rector of St Margaret's, added: &quot;It has been inspirational to see the project take shape in recent months and to witness the kind of connections and re-connections which have taken place.&quot;The exhibition is only a fraction of the materials collected during the project but they offer a very tangible sense of what makes St Margaret's what it is today.&quot;It is a privilege just knowing that the overall collection of materials and oral history recordings, which are such precious resources, will be stored at the Mitchell Library Archives for future generations to research and enjoy.&quot;

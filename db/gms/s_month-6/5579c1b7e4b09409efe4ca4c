TARTAN can officially damage the value of your car!
Motor industry experts Glass’s have revealed that the huge trend of car personalisation could make it difficult to sell your wheels.
The trade bible, which produces a car value guide, has found that cars like the Vauxhall Adam and Citroen DS3 are examples where the wrong trim and colour choice can have a dramatic effect on its market price.
Rupert Pontin, Head of Valuations at Glass’s, explained: “Factors such as colour have always had a large impact on residual values but the trend towards increasing visual personalisation is magnifying the effect.
“The mauve supermini with a tartan roof and yellow wing mirrors running on 13 inch white alloys might look horrendous to a middle aged man like me but great to a 17-year-old who has just passed their test.
“The problem is that the trade finds it very difficult to know how to value some of these vehicles so will tend to price them down in order to minimise the financial risk.
 

“You could have two Vauxhall Adams that are ostensibly the same on paper but, in the metal, are clearly hundreds or thousands of pounds apart in value because of choices that the original buyer made.
“There are some very cosmetically compromised cars around with colour, trim and wheel combinations that looked good to the first owner on the original order form but are not so attractive in the auction hall.”
Pontin added that car dealers should guide new buyers towards more sensible choices by factoring in the re-sale pitfalls.
He added: “Part of the fun of these vehicles is being able to specify all kinds of options but sometimes dealer sales people must know when they hit the order button that they are creating a dud.
“They arguably have a duty to point out to the customer that some of the decisions they are making are very likely to have a direct impact on the resale value of their vehicle.”

The youngest MP to sit in the House of Commons for almost 350 years has been awarded a first class honours degree in politics from Glasgow University.
Mhairi Black won the Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat for the SNP in last month's general election. 
The 20-year-old sat her final exam on Scottish politics shortly after being elected. 
She will graduate along with the rest of her class in a ceremony at the university on Friday. 
Ms Black said: &quot;I'm really delighted, and looking forward to celebrating the day with my parents and the other students.&quot;
She won her seat by 5,500 votes after overturning former Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander's 16,000 vote majority.
The MP admitted recently that it was &quot;quite bizarre&quot; returning to university after being elected an MP.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, she said: &quot;It was a brass neck walking into a room with people I've been studying with for years and they're all pulling their hair out applying for a million and one jobs and I'm like, 'Hi guys, how's it going?'.&quot;
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: &quot;We would like to congratulate Mhairi Black, as we would all of our students who are graduating this summer.
&quot;They have all worked extremely hard to earn their degrees and we wish them the very best for their future careers.&quot;

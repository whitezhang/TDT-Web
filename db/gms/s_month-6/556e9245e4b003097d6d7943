THIEVES are targetting South Side communities.Police officers have reported a surge in break-ins to vehicles and garden huts in Crookston, Priesthill and South Nitshill.The spree has seen thieves hone in on insecure cars where the owners have left valuable items on view such as mobile phones, laptops and handbags.These areas have also seen a rise in thefts from garden huts that have been left unlocked or have been secured by poor locks and hardware.Area Commander for Glasgow South, Chief Inspector Graham McInarlin, said: &quot;Officers have made several arrests in connection with these incidents which I hope provides some reassurance to the local community that we are focused on cracking down on this issue.&quot;However I would still appeal to members of the public to be extra vigilant and take simple precautions such as checking your vehicle is secure and removing tempting items from view.&quot;It is also important that any sheds, which often contain high value items such as electric tools, bicycles and garden equipment, are kept secure with good quality locks and hardware.&quot;As recently told in the Evening Times, nearby Govanhill has also seen a spike in the number of cars being broke into in the areas.Thieves are &quot;popping&quot; locks on vehicles and hit four cars in just one night.Mr McInarlin added: &quot;Most of the crimes we are seeing could have been prevented if these simple precautions were taken and lots of information about home security can be accessed via the Police Scotland website.&quot;We have stepped up both high visibility and plain clothes patrols in the area and will continue this approach to help keep local people safe and deter criminals.&quot;Anyone who wishes to report suspicious activity can contact police on 101.

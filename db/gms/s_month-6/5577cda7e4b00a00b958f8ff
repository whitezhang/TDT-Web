A BUSINESS boosting firm hope to help entrepreneurs in India with a massive extension to their successful Glasgow scheme.Entrepreneurial Spark will be opening a series of their renowned hatcheries in four Indian cities to help entrepreneurs improve the country's economy.The centres, which offer free office space and support for start-ups, will be opening in Delhi, Noida, GIFT City and Ahmedabad.Three more initiatives in Bangalore, Mumbai and Hyderabad are set to follow.Entrepreneurial Spark's founder Jim Duffy hopes the new scheme will provide much needed help for Indian businesses which in turn will help the jobs market and economy.He said: &quot;We build people who build businesses, and that has a huge positive knock-on effect in terms of innovation, job creation and economic growth.&quot;We have chosen India as our first overseas expansion because of the huge potential there for entrepreneurship to make a difference.&quot;There is a growing entrepreneurial spirit in India, with a young, large and skilled population making the country uniquely placed to foster new business creation.&quot;Mr Duffy also added that, despite a drive for entrepreneurship in the country, there is a lack of available funding and support for smaller businesses.He said: &quot;We intend to break the current paradigm of entrepreneurship acceleration and initiate a revolution in catalysing large scale, high impact entrepreneurship in the country.&quot;The venture, in partnership with investment firm Viridian, will offer budding entrepreneurs a six month stay in the hatchery followed by 18 months of intensive coaching and help.Vijay Raghavan, CEO, Viridian said: &quot;The demographics of our country demand more than a million jobs to be created every month in the next decade.&quot;Our country needs more new entrepreneurs and start-up businesses [but] currently there are large gaps in the support systems for entrepreneurs.&quot;The Viridian Group is keen to address these gaps and support in building the entrepreneurship eco system of India.&quot;We are bringing one of the world's best accelerator programs to India.&quot;We sincerely believe that this tried, tested and highly respected platform can make a significant difference to Indian entrepreneurs.&quot;

COMEDIAN Janey Godley has offered Nicola Sturgeon a stand-up gig at the Edinburgh Festival after her sparkling performance on the Daily Show.
Janey said: “She’d be a brilliant stand-up and after watching that, she could do an opening 10 for me at my show at the festival. I’m officially inviting her as of now.
“She loves the Fringe and since it’s the Free Fringe at the Counting House and it’s all about socialism in this climate of austerity, it would be perfect.”
 
Glasgow-born Janey added: “She was funny, nothing flustered her, her body language was brilliant and she didn’t uncross her legs, didn’t get nervous and batted it back. There’d be nobody heckling Nicola.
“She didn’t let Jon Stewart speak over her, kept her cool and her timing was perfect.”

Janey was impressed that Nicola promoted Scottish comedy. She said: “It was brilliant. Her first words were Edinburgh Festival and comedians. When did you ever see Gordon Brown or Tony Blair mention comedians in the festival or any world leader for that matter? It takes a woman out of Edinburgh to go over to the US to do it.
 

“Billing her as a comedian at the start raised the bar for her and she stepped up to it.
“It’s funny because it shows people are more frightened of being a comedian than being a politician – but she nailed it.”

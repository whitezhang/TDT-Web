AN orchestral reworking of The Who's landmark album Quadrophenia has been denied a place at the top of the classical charts - despite selling enough copies to take the number one spot.Pete Townshend's Classic Quadrophenia, his new symphonised version of the album, has not been accepted into the classical chart due to the fact that the original material is rock music.On discovering his exclusion from the Classical Chart last week, Townshend said: &quot;So musical snobbery in the 'classical' elite is still alive &amp; kicking then? F**k 'em.&quot;I know I'm a rock dinosaur and I'm happy to be one, but the team on Classic Quadrophenia are all young, creative and brilliant.&quot;In a statement, the Official Charts Company said: &quot;Classic Quadrophenia will be treated like any other album of contemporary music recorded in a classical style.&quot;The industry-agreed Official Chart rules stipulate clearly that to qualify for the Official Classical Chart, each album will be judged on the works performed on the album - and that these works must be composed by recognised classical composers and/or in a publicly recognised classical idiom or form.&quot;The album does qualify for the Official Albums Chart, however we wish it all the best. &quot;

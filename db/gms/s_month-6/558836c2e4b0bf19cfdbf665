A BRAVE painter balances on the outside edge of a window... 50 feet up in the middle of a busy city centre.
The daredevil shows no regard for his own safety and even precariously bends down to top up his brush at one point, balancing over the side.
The footage was taken by witness Paul Dorrian who was parking his car at the Cambridge Street car park in Glasgow city centre around 10.30am this morning.
He couldn’t believe the risk the man was taking and pulled out his mobile phone to record him painting the window of a tenement-style flat on Cambridge Street.
 

Paul said: “Coming from a construction background I am very uneasy at this and I am certain that this is not a member of public due to the overalls and type of ladders he is now using inside the house.
“I have walked around the block as if this a business I wish to report this unsafe act to ensure the guy doesn’t end up hurting himself.”
He added: “The guy quickly went back inside to paint the inside of window frame.”

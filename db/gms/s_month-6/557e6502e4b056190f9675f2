A GROUP of young people completed a journey of a life time and gained new qualifications.The 40 young people from across Scotland took part in a personal development programme that has helped them turn their lives around.'The Journey', set up by Venture Scotland, and supported by funding from the ScottishPower Foundation, is an innovative programme that uses outdoor pursuits to help young people gain a range of practical and emotional skills to help them lead happier, healthier and more fulfilling lives.The group started 'The Journey' back in August 2014 and before then many of its members did not have much experience of outdoor activities.Over the past nine months they have taken part in a variety of outdoor based activities such as team games, hill-walking, canoeing, community living and spending a weekend fending for themselves at Venture Scotland's bothy in Glen Etive.As a result, each member has gained valuable skills and a new perspective on life.The young people graduated from the course at a ceremony at Glasgow's Albany Centre and gained qualifications including the National Navigation Award Scheme, SCA Canoe 1 Star, Mountain Bike Leader, Archery Instructor and John Muir Discovery Award for conservation.Tam Hendry, Chief Executive, Venture Scotland, said: &quot;It is incredible to see the transformation each year in the young people who complete 'The Journey'.&quot;Back in August many of the participants lacked self-esteem and faced numerous challenges in their home lives.&quot;Thanks to the support of the ScottishPower Foundation, young people facing the odds have been given an opportunity to engage with the natural world and establish a sense of community and self-worth, to help them move on to the next chapter in their lives.&quot;

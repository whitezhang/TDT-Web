PIPERS have blown thousands of pounds on Betty McKay’s woolly creations.
The great-granny has knitted hundreds of pipers and drummers – and even whole pipe bands that sell for &pound;400 a set.
And all the cash goes to the Highland Hospice in Inverness.
The 81-year-old’s knitting needles have been working overtime ahead of the European Pipe Band Championships in Forres two weeks today.
Betty’s cute creations go down a storm when hundreds of musicians and spectators hit her home town, where she works in the hospice’s charity shop.
She even takes orders a year in advance from pipers desperate for a knitted portrait.
Betty said yesterday: “Everyone seems to like them.
“They’ve gone all over the world. To America, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, South America, Ireland, you name it.
 

“Some pipers who arrived after they were sold out ordered some to be made specially then pick them up at the next European Championship.
“It’s really nice. I enjoy making them.”
Betty takes about a week to complete one piper and the tartan kilts come from the wool she has to hand. The dolls – complete with a sporran – then go on sale in the hospice charity shop. She said: “The knitting’s the easy bit.
“The time is taken up with stuffing them with pillow filling and making the pipes from straws.” And the going rate for one of Betty’s pipe bands?
A drum major or a pipe major will cost &pound;25 each, a piper or a drummer &pound;15 and a spectator &pound;10 – so the pipe band pictured below left costs about &pound;400. Not a lot considering the effort – and love – put into their creation.
● For the knitters out there, Betty bases her pipers on the famous Jean Greenhowe knitting patterns.

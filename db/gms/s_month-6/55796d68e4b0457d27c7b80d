THE SNP will next week demand full tax-and-spend powers for the Scottish Parliament.
SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson last night confirmed his group will table amendments to the Scotland Bill for Full Fiscal Autonomy.
The move would give Holyrood powers to raise and spend all its own money – but there is virtually no chance it will happen.
The extra powers – dubbed devo-max – would be voted down by the Tory Government, prompting claims from David Cameron that the SNP bid is a ploy to create further division.
At Prime Minister’s Questions, he accused the SNP of bluffing.
He said: “The SNP’s new approach is to demand something they don’t want and then to complain when they don’t get it.”
Experts have warned devo-max would lead to the loss of &pound;7.6billion a year of Barnett funding.
The SNP’s amendment can be seen as a response to those who say the Scottish Government is shying away from asking for FFA because of the negative economic impact.
The Prime Minister goaded Robertson on the issue yesterday after he boasted the Scottish government had become a living wage employer.
Cameron said it was unlikely the Scottish Government could afford to pay the &pound;7.85 an hour rate if they had FFA.
He added: “I do notice that consensus in the SNP has rather broken down over full fiscal autonomy.
“Because of course, if they got full fiscal autonomy, they probably wouldn’t be able to afford to be a living wage employer.”
The SNP want to see “full fiscal responsibility”, their version of FFA, introduced over a number of years with no sudden cut-off of Barnett funding.

 THEY reckon to fully appreciate Glasgow ’s beauty you should always look upwards - but here’s proof that doesn’t have to be the case. 
This bird’s eye footage shows the city in all it’s glory - from Dear Green Place to archetectural grandeur.
The 2m30s clip begins over the River Clyde at the Science Centre before heading west past Kelvingrove Art Gallery and back into the city via the new Transport Museum and Waverley Paddle Steamer.
 

Other landmarks which feature in the fly-by include the Hydro, the Squinty Bridge, the City Chambers, George Square and the University of Glasgow before a gorgeous sunset over the Clyde ends the sequence.
The film was uploaded to YouTube by Air visual on Monday. Have a look at it in our player above.

ONE of Scot&shy;land’s most se&shy;nior po&shy;lice of&shy;fi&shy;cers has been accused of cheating on an elite command course.
The Herald reports that an investigation has been launched into As&shy;sis&shy;tant Chief Con&shy;sta&shy;ble Wayne Maw&shy;son amid claims he passed off a junior officer’s work off as his own as he tried to se&shy;cure the quali&shy;fi&shy;ca&shy;tion nec&shy;es&shy;sary to keep his job.
Mawson has been viewed as heir apparent to the top cop job currently held by Police Scotland’s Chief Constable Sir Stephen House.
An in&shy;ter&shy;nal in&shy;quiry by Po&shy;lice Scot&shy;land’s Counter-Cor&shy;rup&shy;tion Unit was instigated after an anony&shy;mous tip-off.
The al&shy;le&shy;ga&shy;tions were then for&shy;mally re&shy;ferred to the na&shy;tional force’s main watch&shy;dog, the Scot&shy;tish Po&shy;lice Author&shy;ity (SPA) by Deputy Chief Con&shy;sta&shy;ble Neil Richard&shy;son.
The unprecedented claims are be&shy;ing as&shy;sessed to es&shy;tab&shy;lish if they war&shy;rant a full-scale for&shy;mal and indepen&shy;dent in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;ga&shy;tion.
Maw&shy;son has been one of the most po&shy;lit&shy;i&shy;cally high&shy; pro&shy;file chief of&shy;fi&shy;cers in Scot&shy;land and was the public face of controversial stop-and-search tac&shy;tics.
Ac&shy;cu&shy;sa&shy;tions of cheat&shy;ing re&shy;late to Maw&shy;son’s at&shy;ten&shy;dance at the UK Col&shy;lege of Polic&shy;ing’s pres&shy;ti&shy;gious Strate&shy;gic Com&shy;mand Course (SCC) in Sun&shy;ning&shy;dale, Berk&shy;shire, ear&shy;lier this year.
Nor&shy;mally an as&shy;sis&shy;tant chief con&shy;sta&shy;ble would be ex&shy;pected to have al&shy;ready passed the two-month Sun&shy;ning&shy;dale course or an equiv&shy;a&shy;lent be&shy;fore tak&shy;ing up their post.
But Maw&shy;son was ap&shy;pointed ACC, with re&shy;spon&shy;si&shy;bil&shy;ity for com&shy;mu&shy;nity polic&shy;ing in west&shy;ern Scot&shy;land, with&shy;out hav&shy;ing com&shy;pleted the com&shy;mand course. He grad&shy;u&shy;ated in March, at his first at&shy;tempt, two years af&shy;ter be&shy;ing ap&shy;pointed.
It is un&shy;der&shy;stood that all com&shy;mand course can&shy;di&shy;dates had signed a doc&shy;u&shy;ment say&shy;ing all work would be their own.
Po&shy;lice Scot&shy;land can&shy;not judge the mer&shy;its of com&shy;plaints against its own chief of&shy;fi&shy;cers. Th&shy;ese must be re&shy;ferred to SPA and, if they re&shy;late to al&shy;leged mis&shy;con&shy;duct, Pirc.
The SPA, Police Scotland and Mawson all declined to comment when approached by The Herald.
Labour MSP Graeme Pear&shy;son is a for&shy;mer deputy chief con&shy;sta&shy;ble who has him&shy;self com&shy;pleted what he called the “high-oc&shy;tane” strate&shy;gic com&shy;mand course.
He said: “In the con&shy;text of the course, such al&shy;le&shy;ga&shy;tions will rightly be thor&shy;oughly in&shy;ves&shy;ti&shy;gated.”

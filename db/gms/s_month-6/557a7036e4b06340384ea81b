A CAFE trying to tackle Glasgow's food poverty problem has been praised by the Green Party,Patrick Harvie is visiting the Woodlands Community Garden today to talk to volunteers about how their work is helping to provide locals with an alternative to foodbanks.The Scottish Greens leader is also supporting the organisation's crowdfunding campaign to keep the facility running, as their Big Lottery funding runs out at the end of this month.Run by Woodlands Community Development Trust, the pop-up cafe on West Princes Street gives locals the chance to share meals with one another instead of relying on food parcels.Mr Harvie said: &quot;The pop-up cafe is a fantastic project helping tackle food poverty.&quot;By offering shared meals made by volunteers using fresh, local ingredients there are multiple benefits for the community.&quot;While I will continue to campaign for better wages, jobs and social security to prevent food poverty, I believe it's important that we support projects such as the Woodlands food hub.The project's Big Lottery funding is due to run out shortly and I'm pleased to see there's a crowdfund on the go.&quot;I'd urge anyone interested to chip in to help keep this great initiative going.&quot;

A GLASGOW support service has called on Arches campaigners to remember the devastating effects of drug and alcohol abuse in the wake of the venue closure.Marlene Taylor, service manager of Family Addiction Support Service (FASS), urged people to be more sensitive following the club board's decision to enter into administration on Wednesday.Ms Taylor, who works on the frontline in the fight against drugs in Glasgow, said it was &quot;important to remember&quot; that 17-year-old Regane MacColl died after a night out with friends at the Arches nightclub in February last year.The teenager from Duntocher fell ill and collapsed after being given a suspected Mortal Kombat ecstasy pill.Ms Taylor called for more to be done to tackle Scotland's drug and alcohol problems.She said: &quot;Although the Arches had great aspects to it and is a big part of Glasgow, it's important to remember that there were several drug-related incidents at the club and a 17-year-old girl died after collapsing at the club last year.&quot;Through the work we do at FASS we see the devastating effects that drugs can have on people as well as their families and friends.&quot;Many of the clients we support are mothers who have lost a child to drugs and it impacts the whole family.&quot;Although supporters of the Arches must be devastated at the decision by the directors of the board to close the venue, we would call on people to be sensitive to the situation and remember that people's lives have been changed forever by the drug culture.&quot;However, the closure of clubs such as the Arches will not stop people becoming involved with drugs and we would call for more to be done to help tackle the root causes of drug culture and addictions in Scotland.&quot;As the Evening Times reported yesterday, 133 people have lost their jobs through the multi-arts venue closure.It emerged yesterday that plans are being put in place to try and save the arts programmes.Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: &quot;Creative Scotland are continuing to work with The Arches and Glasgow City Council/Glasgow Life to see how those artistic activities, which clearly inspired so many of our artists, can continue.&quot;The Scottish Government stands ready to support those staff affected through its initiative for responding to redundancy situations, Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE).&quot;A protest has been organised by Arches supporters to take place at 9am on June 18 at the City Chambers before the next council licensing board committee takes place.More than 300 people have said they are going to the protest on Facebook.The page says: &quot;We call on Glasgow Council to act immediately to Save The Arches, reopening it with its licensing fully restored.&quot;The closure of The Arches raises the very real danger that it fall into the hands of a mainstream commercial concern which would close down the venue's arts provision.&quot;

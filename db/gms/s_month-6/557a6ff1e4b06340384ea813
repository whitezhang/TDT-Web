FIRE chiefs have warned those who vandalise hydrants that they could be putting lives at risk.The message came after six incidents on Wednesday in the Greater Glasgow area.And it is expected that the vandalisms will become more frequent during summer holidays and warmer weather.Jim Hassan, Scottish Water's water operations manager in the Glasgow area, said: &quot;Some children and teenagers, and even some adults, think setting off a fire hydrant is fun and just a prank.&quot;But hydrant vandalism is very serious and can have potentially fatal consequences.&quot;Scottish Water, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Police Scotland issued the joint warning, and pointed out that vandalising or setting off a hydrant can lead to a fine of up to &pound;5000.They say the reduced water pressure can make it harder for firefighters to do their job and unusually high pressure can put passers-by at risk.Loss of water supply, low water pressure and discoloured water are other possible outcomes for potentially &shy;thousands of houses.Assistant chief officer Lewis Ramsay, of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: &quot;Damaging a hydrant could cause serious problems for firefighters battling to stop flames from destroying someone's home or even claiming lives.&quot;Areas where incidents were reported on Wednesday included Easterhouse, Springburn, Baillieston, Garrowhill, Bargeddie and East Kilbride.Superintendent Ross Aitken, of Police Scotland, said: &quot;We would ask any member of the public to report such acts.&quot;

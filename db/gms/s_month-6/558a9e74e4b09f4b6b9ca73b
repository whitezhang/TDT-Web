GHA helping communitiesFROM using technology to help people turn their lives around, to organising events for sporty senior citizens, Glasgow Housing Association continues to support Streets Ahead with gusto.The organisation has packed a lot in to the last 12 months, kicking off with the successful Click and Connect initiative at centres across Glasgow.The project, run by GHA in conjunction with Glasgow Kelvin College, provides free internet access and learning support at dedicated centres all over the city.We revealed how Townhead residents were already reaping the benefits at the local Village Hall.Caretaker David Douglas, who lost his business when it went bankrupt, used the Click and Connect services to get back on his feet.“I had a tough time, as I lost my home too and I had to start from scratch to build it all back up,” he said.“Click and Connect gave me a lot of support.”GHA’s Summer of Sport event, part of the legacy from last year’s Commonwealth Games, brought around 170 men and women together for a fun competition at Tollcross International Swimming Centre in October.Fit finalists battled it out in a range of sports, including indoor curling, bowling, judo, giant Jenga and javelin.The participants, from sheltered housing complexes across the city, also took part in swimming and walking challenges as well as Commonwealth Games-inspired art and photography competitions.Christmas time can be hard on vulnerable families and those living on a tight budget, but thanks to Streets Ahead and GHA, many enjoyed a little extra festive cheer last year.Around 120 Cardonald pensioners enjoyed a festive lunch, bingo, raffle and live band as part of a Christmas lunch celebration organised by GHA’s South Area Committee.Pupils from Smithycroft Secondary teamed up with GHA staff in the north east of the city to deliver festive hampers to vulnerable families in Carntyne, Dennistoun, Cranhill, Ruchazie, Craigend and Garthamlock.And in Knightswood, events organised by GHA and community charity Linkes included a pensioner’s lunch, trip to the panto and women’s group pizza and panto party.Schoolchildren from four primary schools in Drumchapel had their artwork on display in thousands of homes after winning a GHA calendar competition.Pupils from Antonine, Langfaulds, Camstradden and St Clare’s all took part and the winning designs were distributed to homes across the area.

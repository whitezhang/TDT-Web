 A FORMAL complaint has been lodged with the BBC over claims that Scots Olympic gold medal winner Allan Wells took drugs . 
The allegations were aired in a Panorama programme where a secretly recorded tape of a former GB team doctor making the claims was broadcast.
The lawyer acting for the 1980 Moscow Olympic 100 metres winner Wells, Peter Watson, says he was refused access to the tape prior to broadcast, it is reported.
Watson says the corporation breached its own guidelines by refusing access to the tape of now deceased Jimmy Ledingham where he makes a series of claims against Wells.
It was secretly recorded by Wells’ fellow sprinter, Drew McMaster.
 Both Wells and Watson have vehemently denied the claims, which Wells has described as a “shocking slur” . 
Watson says the BBC had also refused to give a sworn statement from one of the alleged witnesses and has refused to rule out a defamation action.
He said the programme had managed only to “establish that someone had made an allegation. They can’t prove the allegation.”
The BBC has confirmed that the complaint has been received.
A spokesman said:”This has been dealt with in the normal way.”

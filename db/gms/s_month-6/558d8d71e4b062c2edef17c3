Costa set for Dumbarton High StreetCOFFEE chain Costa is set to open an outlet in Dumbarton High Street after councillors planning permission.The coffee shop will take over a vacant unit on the corner of High Street and Quay Street, which was previously occupied by Game Station.The building will be refurbished before Costa - which will be open from 7am to 8pm seven days a week - moves in.Proposals were approved at a meeting of West Dunbartonshire’s planning committee this week.Councillor Lawrence O’Neill, convener of the planning committee, said: “I’m delighted that such a recognised retailer has chosen to move to Dumbarton High Street.&quot;The council is committed to constantly improving the town centre and I’m sure residents will welcome the arrival of such a well known coffee outlet.&quot;This is another boost for the town centre, with the Council offices set to move into the old Dumbarton Academy building as well.&quot;

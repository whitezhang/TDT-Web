SOUP entrepreneur Ena Baxter’s house is up for sale for &pound;850,000.
The six-bedroom property includes the kitchen where the famous housewife cooked up ideas for gourmet recipes which helped turn the family into millionaires.
The kitchen became the set for many of Ena’s television adverts.
At the end of filming, she would often relax with family in a nearby room named the Last Cast bar.
Speybank House has been put on the market following Ena’s death, at the age of 90, in January.
Her husband Gordon, 95, died in February 2013.
 

The house, in Fochabers, Moray, was originally built by the Duke of Richmond and Gordon for his factor.
Later, it became a hotel before Gordon Baxter bought it in 1964 and converted it into a family home.
Ena married Gordon in 1952. She was an art teacher at a local school but was persuaded to change career and work in the family’s food factory after her husband tasted her soup.
Speybank includes a two-bedroom detached coach house and private grounds.
Rod Christie, handling the sale on behalf of CKD Galbraith, said: “Speybank is undoubtedly one of the finest houses in the area.
“With so many fine period features and a range of spacious rooms, the house could be used not only as a wonderful family home as it has most recently but possibly as a boutique Hotel or Guest House.
“Many of the ground floor rooms have tall ceilings with ornate cornicing and plasterwork, open fireplaces with attractive surrounds and mantelpieces, working servant’s bells and timber shutters.
“The interior decor would benefit from a degree of modernisation however it would allow the new owners to put their own stamp on the property and breathe new life into a truly remarkable building.”

A BLAZE which led to three adults and a baby being taken to hospital is being treated as suspicious by police.
Emergency services were called to the scene at Grampian Court in Aberdeen at about 10.50pm yesterday.
Fire crews quickly extinguished the blaze, which began in a communal bin room.
Paramedics checked 21 people at the scene but most did not need hospital treatment.
Two men and a woman were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary while a baby boy was taken to the Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital.
They were suffering from smoke inhalation, though it was thought to be minor.
Emergency services also dealt with a fire outside Tesco on Wellington Road in Aberdeen at about 10.15pm last night.
The fire was quickly extinguished and there were no injuries.
Police are treating both incidents as wilful fireraising and appealed for information.
They are particularly keen to trace a group of six people who were seen in the area of Wellington Road prior to the first fire.
Inspector David Paterson, of the Torry community policing team, said: &quot;Fire creates a significant danger to both the emergency services and the people in the area.
&quot;With the latter of these two incidents, we've seen four people taken to hospital and we can be thankful that things did not take a turn for the worse.
&quot;We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry and can reassure the local people we will carry out a robust investigation.&quot;
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) are also involved in the investigation.
SFRS group manager Fraser Burr said: &quot;The service would like to remind people that those responsible for setting deliberate fires not only place our attending fire crews at risk but also potentially impact on our ability to respond to more important emergencies elsewhere in the city.
&quot;Deliberate fire setting is a crime and we encourage anyone who has any information to contact Police Scotland.&quot;

HUNTERSTON nuclear power station has been forced to take a reactor offline because of seaweed.
One of the station's two reactors was shut down and the second operating at a reduced capacity due to the high levels of seaweed in the waters feeding into the plant for cooling.
Hunterston B's operators, EDF Energy, said the reactor was taken offline on Monday at around 7pm.
A spokeswoman told BBC Scotland the move was a precaution and there were no safety issues.
Hunterston began operating in 1976 and its working life has already been extended to 2023 - well beyond its planned closure date.

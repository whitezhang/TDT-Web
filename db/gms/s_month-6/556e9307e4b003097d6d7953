A HISTORIC bill to change Scotland's transplant laws has been formally launched in parliament.Transplant patients joined doctors' leaders and major charities including the British Heart Foundation yesterday as Labour MSP Anne McTaggart presented her Transplantation (Authorisation of Organs) Scotland Bill.A striking display of 459 crosses - one for every patient who has died this year on the UK transplant list - underlined the reason why the bill is being launched.Campaigners believe an opt-out system - where the default position is that everyone is considered a donor but the right to say no is respected - is the most efficient way to make more organs available for life-saving transplants.The bill was launched on the back of the Evening Times' award-winning Opt for Life campaign, which was backed by close to 30,000 people in Glasgow.It will now be referred to the Health and Sport Committee, potentially later this month and the Labour MSP will be called to give evidence, along with doctors, charities and church leaders.It is anticipated that the bill could go to a vote in September or October.If it passes this first, critical stage, campaigners believe the bill will become law.The proposed changes will apply to anyone over the age of 16 in Scotland.Like Wales, which will move to an opt-out system on December 1, under the proposed legislation family will still be consulted about the final decision.If a person does not opt-out of the register, the family will be asked if there have appointed a proxy to make a decision on their behalf. If no such person has been appointed, the nearest relative will be asked if there was any circumstance which prevented the individual opting out or whether they know of any objection the relative may have had to organ donation.The key change under the opt-out system is that the views of the deceased are paramount.At yesterday's launch, a recorded message from TV presenter Lorraine Kelly was played, where she praised the Evening Times' Opt for Life campaign and urged the Scottish Government to follow Wales and switch to an opt-out system.She said: &quot;We really do need to support this as needless lives are being lost.&quot;I hope today's launch is a success and the bill receives the support it deserves.&quot;Labour MSP Anne McTaggart appealed to everyone in favour of the change to lobby their MSP.Previous research by the Evening Times has indicated that more than half of MSPs are supportive but the bill is likely to face some opposition from church leaders, although no religion is against the principle of organ donation.Ms McTaggart said: &quot;This is not Anne McTaggart's bill. We need to make this happen but to make this happend we need your support.&quot;Brian Keeley, 52, was among the transplant patients present at yesterday's launch in support of the bill.The Glasgow-born artist underwent a heart transplant at the Golden Jubillee hospital in Clydebank after suffering a major heart attack in July 2013 while on holiday in Islay with his wife Bibo, 40.He spent a month in a coma and woke up to the news that his heart had been irreversibly damaged.At one point the couple were told there was nothing more that could be done and the couple decided to marry in hospital.However his health improved and he became stable enough to be placed on the transplant list. Two weeks later he was given a new heart.While he was recovering he painted every one of the 24 NHS staff who cared for him as well as Bibo, &quot;because she helped me survive&quot;.He said: &quot;I read someone that 10% of organs are not usable, for various reasons, such as the health of the donor.&quot;It's a like a combination lock. Everything has to match up.&quot;The more organs that are available, the more chance that organs will be suitable for an individual.&quot;&quot;The opt-out system will make the whole process run smoother and faster. &quot;Speed is of the essence.&quot;

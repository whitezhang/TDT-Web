A MUM stabbed moments after dropping off her children at school was rushed back to hospital yesterday.
Charlene Malone, 29, was attacked outside her home at 9am on Monday.
The mum of three was released from hospital later in the day after being treated for knife wounds sustained in Drylaw, Edinburgh.
A relative said: “Charlene had to go back into hospital after collapsing on Monday night.
“Her skin was grey and she kept passing out so we’re worried she has an infection. It was a terrible thing that happened to her.”
A friend said Charlene was slashed on the arm and stabbed in the back by a man and a woman who jumped out of a car.
A police spokesman said: “We are following a positive line of inquiry.”

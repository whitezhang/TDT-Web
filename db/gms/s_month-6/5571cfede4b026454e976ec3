A DRIVER had to be cut free from the wreckage of his car early today following a head-on road crash on the A737 west of Glasgow.
The man suffered head and chest injuries and is being taken to hospital.
Another man, the driver of the other vehicle involved, a Mitsubishi Shogun, suffered minor head injuries in the collision which happened near the B787, Howwood and Kilbarchan road.
The crash happened at the spot where the dual-carriageway merges into a two-way road, a notorious accident blackspot.
It is believed that one of the drivers involved may have suffered a blackout moments before the crash.
The crash happened shortly after 6am.
Police closed the road in both directions.
Two fire appliances from Johnstone were in attendance.
The driver of the smaller vehicle involved had to be cut free from his car by firefighters using specialist cutting equipment.
Traffic Scotland said: ”The A737 is closed in both directions at Kilbarchan due to a road traffic incident.
“Drivers are advised to use an alternate route and expect longer than normal journey times.”
A Police Scotland spokesman said: &quot;We are still awaiting a full medical update. Both drivers are out their vehicles.
“We are in the process of clearing the roadway and trying to get it re-opened.
“It happened where the dual carriageway and the single carriageway meet at Johnstone.”
Early today traffic was being diverted through Johnstone, causing long delays.
The A737, which joins the M8 at St James interchange near Glasgow Airport, is the main route from the city into north Ayrshire.

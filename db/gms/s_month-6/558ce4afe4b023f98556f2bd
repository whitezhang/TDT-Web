Tot's YouTube video will help raise cash for fellow Diabetes sufferersAN Airdrie tot is helping to raise funds for Diabetes Scotland by sharing her story of living with the condition.Three-year-old Beth Harris stars in her own YouTube video, which was launched to mark Diabetes Week.Narrated by Beth’s five-year-old brother Jacob, the video explains what it is like to live with Type 1 diabetes as a child, including using an insulin pump, testing blood sugars ten times a day and weighing food to calculate the correct amount of insulin required.“Sometimes my blood sugars get low, this makes me feel shaky and my legs go like jelly. I tell everyone my head feels crazy,” Beth explains in the video. “I have Type 1 diabetes, but it does not have me. I can run, jump, skip, and have super fun.”Debi Harris, Beth and Jacob’s mum, has also organised a team of 20 runners to take part in the 5k Color Me Rad Run on Glasgow Green on June 28. Known as the Sugarbabes, the team includes Beth and Jacob and is aiming to raise &pound;1000 for Diabetes Scotland.Debi said: &quot;I have supported Diabetes Scotland and the work and research they do for people with diabetes for many years. Team Sugarbabes has grown from five people to over 20, who are all affected by Type 1 diabetes in some way. We are focused on raising as much money as we can for the charity as well as raising awareness about Type 1 diabetes as a condition.”Susie Williamson, Diabetes UK’s Regional Fundraiser for Glasgow, said: “It’s been such a privilege to work with Debi in the formation of this team, who are working really hard to raise money for Diabetes Scotland to help people affected by diabetes. Debi and her family understand Type 1 diabetes inside out, and it’s so inspiring that they are doing this to help us work towards finding a cure for the condition. I can’t thank them all enough.”You can watch the video by searching for “Diabetes Week Beth’s Story” online at www.youtube.comFor further information or to support the Sugarbabes, visit www.justgiving.com/DiabetesScotlandSugarbabes/

 Motherwell have signed Scotland Under-21 defender Joe Chalmers on a two-year contract. 
 Chalmers, 21, was a free agent after being released by Celtic. 
 He made his Celtic debut at 18 against Inverness in 2012 under previous manager Neil Lennon, before a loan spell at Falkirk in 2013-14. 
 &quot;He's a young player with fantastic potential who we've tracked for some time,&quot; manager Ian Baraclough told the Motherwell website&nbsp; 
 &quot;He's versatile, mobile with a good range of passing and will add competition in numerous positions in defence. 
 &quot;He's got a good pedigree having came through the academy and played for Celtic's first team and had significant youth international experience.&quot; 
 Chalmers is Motherwell's first new signing since they secured their Scottish Premiership status with a 6-1 aggregate win over Rangers in the play-offs. 
 The club have offered new contracts to Lionel Ainsworth, John Sutton and Lee Erwin. 
 &quot;I've been in a few times and trained with the lads and it's a really good group,&quot; said Chalmers. 
 &quot;The manager has also been excellent with me and was a huge reason why I wanted to come and play here.&quot;

Probe continues into tenement fireFIRE investigators were today trying to identify the cause of a blaze which ripped through a Glasgow tenement.As reported in late editions of yesterday's Evening Times, terrified residents were forced to jump from a first-floor window to escape the fire.Five other people - including two young children - were rescued from the upper floors after the major blaze broke out below their homes.Emergency services raced to the scene in Mannering Road, Shawlands on Wednesday night and found a fire had broken out in the ground floor flat.The three adults leapt to safety as the inferno took hold at around 9.30pm.Station Manager Scott Murray, said: “Our crews arrived to find an already well-developed fire in a ground floor property and thick smoke affecting the floors above.&quot;Eight firefighters in breathing apparatus were committed to the building to tackle the fire and conduct a systematic search.&quot;Three adults and two children were rescued by firefighters using ladders.&quot;The five appeared to be suffering from slight smoke inhalation and they received treatment from paramedics.&quot;At its height, four fire engines were called out and around 20 firefighters were on the scene.The three people who fled from the first floor were taken to hospital and were receiving treatment for &quot;jump-related injuries&quot;.The horrific blaze gutted the ground floor and charred debris could be seen lying in the street.Station Manager Murray explained: “None of us can ever afford to think fire is something that can only happen to other people.&quot;It really can strike anywhere and this incident shows how quickly neighbouring properties can become affected.&quot;Thick smoke from this fire rapidly spread through the building’s close and the heavy smoke logging on all floors blocked people’s exit.&quot;It would obviously be a very frightening experience.&quot;That should bring home to all of us the importance of having early warning so a 999 call can be made and firefighters can get there quickly.&quot;

A MAN has died after a blaze swept through his Glasgow home.
Fire crews were sent to Fifth Avenue in Anniesland following a 999 call at 3.30am on Monday.
It is believed a dropped cigarette set bedding alight but investigators are still probing the incident.
Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found the man still alive in a bedroom at the two-storey property.
He was given emergency treatment for severe burns and smoke inhalation at the scene before being taken by ambulance to South Glasgow University Hospital where he later died.
Assistant chief officer Lewis Ramsay, the SFRS director of prevention and protection, expressed his condolences and urged anyone concerned about fire safety issues to contact them.
He said: “In the wake of this tragedy everyone’s thoughts will of course be with the man’s family and friends.
“The loss of life through fire in the home will certainly be felt across the community and it will profoundly touch many people.
“We must all be asking ourselves if we know someone who could be at risk and thinking about those who are older, who have health conditions or who live alone and might be a bit isolated.
“Our crews can provide them with support to reduce the risk they will experience a fire or be hurt as a result, so anyone who is concerned about a friend, a relative or a neighbour should contact us now.”

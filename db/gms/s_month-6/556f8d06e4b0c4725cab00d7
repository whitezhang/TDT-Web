 Lanarkshire businessman Tom Wotherspoon has purchased a controlling stake in Airdrieonians and become chairman of the Scottish League One club. 
 Jim Ballantyne steps down as chairman with his family selling their shares. 
 Wotherspoon is a director of M&amp;H Logistics, who will become the club's new sponsor. 
 &quot;I'm thrilled to have this chance to develop and improve one of Scotland's great football clubs both on and off the park,&quot; he told Airdrie's website.&nbsp; 
 &quot;The Ballantyne family has shown great passion, dedication and knowledge in guiding Airdrieonians and we will lean on that heavily for the way ahead. 
 &quot;I'm a football fan with a solid business background and my heart is always in projects that I feel support the game in the right way. 
 &quot;I believe football can have such a positive influence on so many aspects of life, the club should be the beating heart of the community and that's my aim for Airdrieonians.&quot; 
 And the club added: &quot;Last season M&amp;H backed Premiership side Hamilton Accies, League Two club East Fife and BSC Glasgow in the Lowland League. 
 &quot;Now the company will back Gary Bollan's side as they bid for promotion to the Championship in 2015-16.&quot; 
 This season Bollan led Airdrie to a fifth-place finish in League One, one point below the promotion play-off places.

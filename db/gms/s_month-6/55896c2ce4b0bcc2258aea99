 AN AWARD-winning trilogy of plays dubbed “Scotland’s Game of Thrones” is set to tour the UK. 
 The James Plays, written by Rona Munro, will be performed from Inverness to Plymouth next year. 
 The National Theatre of Scotland trilogy, directed by Laurie Sansom, was one of the highlights of last year’s Edinburgh International Festival, starring Blythe Duff, Jamie Sives and The Killing’s Sophie Grabol. 
Rona Munro said: “I have probably never had a better professional experience than I did last year with Laurie and the company of The James Plays.
&quot;The only experience that could top that is to continue the adventure and to bring the plays home to Scotland again. I can’t wait to be back in that rehearsal room and back in front of that audience.”
Director Laurie Sansom added: “The excitement we all felt at embarking on this journey to bring to life a little known part of Scottish history and stage Rona’s remarkable trilogy, was only matched by the excitement of sharing it with audiences at the EIF and at the National Theatre in London.
&quot;We now have the chance to share it with audiences across the UK which will be a real privilege.
 &quot;We are indebted to all the partners who have made this possible, including the Scottish Government. ” 
The plays will tour Edinburgh, Birmingham, Leicester, Inverness, Glasgow, Northampton, Salford, Newcastle, Sheffield, Norwich, Canterbury, Plymouth and Nottingham from 3 February to 3 July 2016.

HAYBURN Park is the first project in Scotland to reach its fundraising target using crowdfunding site MyParkScotland.The Hayburn Park Play Association secured enough funding to build its mini-orchard project just three weeks after their appeal on the funding website went live.Gwen Galbreith of Hayburn Park Play Association said: &quot;We've never tried crowdfunding before and so didn't really know what to expect.&quot;We've been overwhelmed by the generosity of people.&quot;Now we're all really looking forward to planting our mini-orchard and hope to welcome some of our supporters later in the year for a planting ceremony - and we would love them to come back in future years to experience the joy of picking and biting into an apple that they've helped to grow.&quot;MyParkScotland, launched on May 23, is a crowdfunding platform which allows parks in Glasgow and Edinburgh to appeal for donations to improve their facilities.The site, launched last month and run by greenspace Scotland, is proving very popular according to its project manager.Ian Goodman, MyParkScotland, said: &quot;The Hayburn mini-orchard project is a really good example of how to run a successful crowdfund.&quot;The group had a clear need for their project, were realistic about how much money they could raise and built support in advance of the crowdfund going live so that they quickly - in the first weekend - reached the tipping point of securing 50% of the funding.&quot;Initially only parks in Glasgow and Edinburgh are covered by the site but organisers hope to roll the project out across the country.

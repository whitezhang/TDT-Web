Glasgow School of Art restoration is 'globally significant'THE work to restore fire-damaged Glasgow School of Art is of global significance, says a leading architect.David Page, director of Page/Park, is managing a team of 12 architects on the three year project which could cost up to &pound;35 million.He said the Mackintosh building is one of the most important in the world and compared it to the Taj Mahal.Mr Page told the Evening Times: &quot;This is a global project of world wide significance.&quot;The Mackintosh building is one of the most important in the world, along with buildings like the Taj Mahal.&quot;But this is also Glasgow building and that must never be lost.&quot;He added: &quot;We have a large team working on the restoration and it is a huge privilege but we must get it right.&quot;The project is in the research stage and architects are currently studying pictures of the building and rooms throughout the years along with the fabric of the building and unique details exposed by the fire.He said: &quot;We can see the air ducts, how the bricks were laid and generally how this amazing building was put together.&quot;This is very unique.&quot;One of challenges in restoring the building is finding the right materials.&quot;Some of those used by Mackintosh are not available so we must find ones that perform in the way that they did.&quot;We must also look at the way things were stained and coloured.&quot;The studios were originally a grey/green colour but they were later painted white.&quot;So should they be restored to original colour or painted white? It is a judgement call for the whole team involved.&quot;

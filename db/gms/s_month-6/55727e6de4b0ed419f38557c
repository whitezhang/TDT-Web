SPAMALOT is a crazy eclectic mix of nonsense which will genuinely have you laughing out loud.
Put simply, it is the funniest show I have ever seen.
There was a continuous supply of belly-laugh moments, befitting the genius brain of Monty Python's Eric Idle.
Joe Pasquale as King Arthur was far better than you might imagine.
His squeaky - voiced persona was toned down sufficiently to accommodate the role. And his conic toning was precision perfect.
It truly was an unexpected joy.Basically the plot centres around Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail - a scenario unashamedly ripped off from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
It introduces the knights of his Round Table and there are more than a few surprises in store when you get to know then better.
Pasquale's entire supporting cast were amazingly good, encapsulating the deranged style of the Pythons.
But, without doubt, Pasquale's own son, Joe Tracini, stole the show as Patsy.
Tracini may not have had a lot of lines but he was a constant source of amusement.
His facial expressions and quizzical looks were the work if someone burn into comedy.
His rendition of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life was delightful and his acting during I'm All Alone was hernia inducingly funny.
Director Christopher Luscombe is a master of comedy and once again he has a smash on his hands.So long as you're not dead yet don't miss it.

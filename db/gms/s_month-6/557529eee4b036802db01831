A COUPLE whose first baby was stillborn 14 years ago today have spoken of their shock after they received a letter in error saying their son was born alive.Michelle and James McGhee asked for medical records from the day their first child was delivered and were shocked when they opened the letter.The records stated that Michelle had given birth to a &quot;live male.&quot;The couple, from Cardonald, also received the health records of another woman - who is named - in the double blunder.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it was &quot;deeply sorry&quot; for the errors.But Michelle said the records have planted a seed of doubt in her head about the first few moments after she delivered their son.Immediately after he was delivered, their son, James, was taken away for 35 minutes before they were allowed to see him.The couple were advised to ask for their medical records last year, as they are involved in the baby ashes inquiry, led by Dame Elish Angiolini.Michelle, 31, said: &quot;After we got the letter we phoned the hospital and asked for a meeting with the consultant, who was initially not going to see us.&quot;We then had a meeting a few weeks ago and he was really rude and cheeky to the point that I screamed at him.&quot;He wasn't interested in looking at my medical records or talking about them.&quot;He just said, 'Well obviously it's a mistake.&quot;&quot;The wee nurse who was with us was in tears.&quot;She said to us, 'I'm really sorry, this type of thing doesn't normally happen 14 years down the line' But it should never have happened.&quot;It makes the whole thing absolutely worse.&quot;It has turned our lives upside down.&quot;Now we have questions about that first 35 minutes. Was our son alive? How long was he alive?&quot;In all honestly it probably is a mistake but the minute we saw it, it tore me apart.&quot;When we went in I said to him. 'please show me something, any record that tells me James was dead.'&quot;There is nothing.&quot;The couple received a letter from Dr Stewart Pringle, a consultant obstetrician, in February this year, apologising for the errors.It said: &quot;I can confirm that your son was stillborn in 2001 and not alive as the letter of June 18 (2014) suggested.&quot;I am sorry this has caused you and your family so much upset to add to your original grief.&quot;The incorrectly filed CTG record for another patient has been removed and filed appropriately.&quot;The couple were both, just 17 when they discovered they were expecting a baby.Michelle said: &quot;We had been together for about a year when we found out we were pregnant.&quot;Everything was fine, no problems. A great pregnancy.&quot;Then when I was 27 weeks, I was staring to not feel movement. My mum came with me to see the midwife and she said that she couldn't find a heartbeat but not to worry.&quot;She sent us up to the Southern where we had a scan and were told that he had passed away.&quot;I was destroyed.&quot;I was given drugs to bring on the labour. What can you say about it? I knew I was giving birth to a baby would never breathe.&quot;James said: &quot;It was difficult. Trying to be strong for Michelle. We got a bit of time with him.&quot;It was a good couple of hours.&quot;The couple endured more heartache after Michelle suffered a number of miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies but now have two children, Kieran, nine, and six-year-old Emily.They are involved in the investigation into the baby ashes scandal, which was sparked by events at Mortonhall Crematorium in Edinburgh but has now been extended to other crematoria in Scotland.Their son was cremated at Craigton Crematorium but they were given no ashes and have no grave to visit, only a small plaque of remembrance.Michelle was told to retrieve her records for evidence for the inquiry, which is being led by Dame Elish Angiolini.She said: &quot;We never got James' ashes and we always questioned why.&quot;A spokeswoman for NHSGGC said: &quot;We fully recognise that the two information errors that have occurred in our communication with this patient will have undoubtedly undermined her confidence in our services.&quot;We are deeply sorry for the distress and additional grief that this has caused.&quot;Two senior clinicians have met with the patient to offer her full reassurance and clarity that there is no doubt as to the circumstances of this tragic case.&quot;On June 14, James, 31, along with five other relations, will row 25 miles of Loch Lomond over two days in a canoe to raise funds for the charity -Forget-Me-Not Care and Counselling - which helps families affected by stillbirth.&quot;To sponsor the team go to www.justgiving.com/michelle-mcghee/For advice and support about stillbirth: www.forgetmenotcounselling.org/.

 
A STEAMIN GUY JUST TRIED TO THROW A DEAD SEAGULL AT ME AND AARON HAHAHAHAHA pic.twitter.com/0lcYGWcfgN

THE hilarious image of an apparently drunk man's attempt to throw a dead seagull has gone viral across Scotland.
Only two seconds long, the Twitter video shows a &quot;steaming&quot; man at Garrowhill train station in Glasgow, pick up the dead animal and attempt to throw it before losing his balance and falling over on his backside.
Picking up the dead bird from beside the train station sign, he starts swinging it around before completely losing his footing and falling back onto the road.
 
Raucous laughter comes from behind the camera as the man's two legs end straight up in the air above him.
 
 
 

Sean Bryans uploaded the video to Twitter last week, simply saying: &quot;A steamin guy just tried to throw a dead seagull at me and Aaron.&quot;
Great things come in small packages, because despite only being two seconds long, the clip has already received 2500 retweets and Twitter celeb comedian Limmy has described it as one of &quot;the best things in the world&quot;, adding if we're only to leave one thing for the aliens to find, this video should be it.
 
 
 
That steaming guy trying to throw a dead seagull but falling over with his legs in the air is one of the best things in the world.
Please let that steaming guy dead seagull video be the only thing we leave behind for the aliens.

He tweeted: &quot;Please let that steaming guy dead seagull video be the only thing we leave behind for the aliens.&quot;
 
Not that it's a competition or anything but user Dave Cochrane tweeted: &quot;One of our local primary schools had a &quot;throw the dead possum&quot; contest a few years back.&quot;
It looks like Scots humour translates well.

VAN Morrison has been knighted in the Queen's Birthday honours.The Belfast-born music veteran, whose unique meshing of blues, country, soul and folk has won him worldwide fame and millions of fans, was honoured for his services to music and tourism in Northern Ireland, the inspiration for many of his hits.His best-known song Brown-Eyed Girl propelled him to stardom in the 1960s and, at 69, he continues to write and perform.He is among 1,163 people recognised by the Queen for their achievements and, for the second time in the honours history, female recipients narrowly outnumber men.Once again the names of some high-profile winners were leaked, with newspapers reporting comedian Lenny Henry's knighthood and Sherlock Holmes actor Benedict Cumberbatch's CBE days ahead of the official announcement.The leaks were met with disappointment in the Cabinet Office, particularly for the recipients involved.Henry, a long-time supporter of the BBC's Comic Relief, said learning the news gave him ''a lovely feeling'' and was ''like being filled with lemonade''.Singer Patti Boulaye has revealed she found out she was being awarded an OBE for charitable services in the UK and Sub-Saharan Africa on her birthday.She said: &quot;I can't believe it. I just can't believe it's happened.&quot;It's incredible and makes me so grateful. I'm a believer in whatever gift we receive, we are supposed to share and use it to help others.&quot;I'm hoping and praying it's just the next stage to some of the work I do.&quot;Ebola nurse Will Pooley, 30, who was urgently evacuated to London after contracting the deadly virus in Sierra Leone last year, only to return to his life-saving work just months after recovering, was named an MBE for his services in tackling the outbreak in Africa.The Suffolk nurse, who is now back in England, was the first British person to contract the disease and sparked an outpouring of support when he flew back to the country to help the thousands of sufferers.Also honoured for his major role in the Ebola crisis is Dr Oliver Johnson, whose swift actions in response to the initial outbreak saved many lives, the Foreign Office said as it named him an OBE for his overseas service in Sierra Leone.Dr Johnson, director of King's Sierra Leone Partnership, said: &quot;Everything we achieved is due to the efforts of extraordinary local health workers and international volunteers, who have bravely led the fight against Ebola and did not hesitate to put their lives at risk to save others.&quot;Another recipient whose compassion captured the hearts of the nation is mother-of-one Katie Cutler, who launched a fundraising campaign for disabled victim Alan Barnes after he was mugged outside his home.Miss Cutler, who has been awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM), hoped to raise &pound;500 for Mr Barnes after learning of the attack but was staggered to see donations rise to more than &pound;300,000 when her appeal went viral, affording the 67-year-old a new home.Prominent sports figures who have made it on to the list include former Welsh rugby star Gareth Edwards, who has been awarded a knighthood for his long service to the game.Making up 5% of the recipients, other sporting stars to receive awards include former England footballer Frank Lampard, who was named an OBE, record-breaking cricketer James Anderson, also named an OBE, and the England women's football captain Casey Stoney, currently competing in the World Cup in Canada, who was named an MBE.Rugby star Jonny Wilkinson, who was left embarrassed after his name was wrongly reported to be in the last set of honours, was awarded a CBE for his dedication to rugby union.Actor and singer Michael Ball has revealed his 80-year-old father Tony burst into tears on hearing the news that his son was being awarded an OBE for services to musical theatre.Ball said he is &quot;chuffed to bits&quot;.&quot;It came out of the blue. I wasn't expecting it and I don't know what to say,&quot; he said.&quot;I love these things. For people in our business, it's all we want is for people to say 'you are lovely'.&quot;Loyd Grossman has said being given his CBE for services to heritage was like &quot;unwrapping a wonderful present&quot;.He said:&quot;I was thrilled because it was this great recognition for doing something I love to do.&quot;I haven't told a single person so it will be a great thrill for my family and friends when they find out.&quot;

A TWISTED rapist who fled Glasgow may be on the run in Turkey, the Evening Times can reveal.Rezgar Zengana brutally raped a 25-year-old woman on a night out in the city centre by posing as a taxi driver.Today - exactly seven years since he went on the run - we can reveal he may be hiding out in a Turkish bolthole.Rather than face sentence after being convicted of rape in June, 2008, Zengana fled the country.The sexual predator - who has as many as four aliases - was ordered to return to court for sentencing the following month, but he then vanished.Senior detectives fear the 32-year-old may have fled to Turkey, which has become a popular haven for criminals looking to keep out of the reach of the law.Police said in 2011 that they feared he had gone to the Netherlands, but now, the net has been widened to Turkey.Zengana is around 6ft tall, of slim build, with black hair and brown eyes. He is described as being of &quot;Middle Eastern appearance&quot; and was born in Iraq in 1983.He has been known to use various aliases, including Abdul Qadar, Rusheer Ahmed, Syed Waq and Ali Kermin.Zengana picked up his victim in Argyle Street in December, 2006, while posing as a private hire driver.She was going home from a Christmas party.But, instead, Zengana took her to a property in Cessnock, where he carried out the attack.He was convicted but was bailed while awaiting sentence, and disappeared. Zengana recently featured on Police Scotland's Most Wanted list and officers have appealed for information.A statement read: &quot;Police Scotland is appealing to the public for any information they have which could help trace him.&quot;If you have seen him, or know someone who may have information of his whereabouts, please contact Police Scotland on 101.

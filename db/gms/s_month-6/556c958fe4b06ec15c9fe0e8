The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has appealed for help in contacting vulnerable people after the 28th fire-related death in Scotland this year.
It wants family and friends of people who are elderly, live alone or have mental health or addiction issues to &quot;put them in touch&quot; with firefighters.
They can then make a home fire safety visit to those &quot;at greatest risk&quot;.
There were 33 deaths from fires in Scotland in 2013-14 - the lowest for more than 20 years.
This was down 28% on the previous year's figure of 46.
With 28 recorded deaths, so far, this year, the fire service wants to get in touch with vulnerable people who are most at risk from house fires.
Assistant chief officer Lewis Ramsay said: &quot;The sad reality is many fatal fires could be prevented. We know very simple steps are often the difference between life and death. 
&quot;Every one of us can make that difference just by talking to people we know who might be vulnerable and putting them in touch with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.&quot; 
Mr Ramsay said that even a small house fire could threaten life.
He added: &quot;We would much rather take the time to do a free home fire safety visit and help someone prevent a fire than respond to a blaze where they may have already suffered life-changing, or even life-ending, injuries. 
&quot;Protecting the most vulnerable members of our communities isn't something we can do alone. Reaching people who need some help to stay safe is always a challenge and we need the public's help to meet it.&quot;

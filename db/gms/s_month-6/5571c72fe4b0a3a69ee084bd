An 88-year-old woman has died and a 63-year-old man has been injured in a fire at a house in North Lanarkshire.
The blaze at the single-storey house in Cumbernauld's Craigelvan Gardens was reported in a 999 call at 11:20.
Fire crews arrived and were met with &quot;a well-developed fire&quot; and the house suffered &quot;a partial collapse&quot;.
Police said the 63-year-old man was treated at the scene by paramedics. An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: &quot;Police can confirm that an 88-year-old woman has died in a fire at Craigelvan Gardens in Cumbernauld and a 63-year-old man was also treated at the scene by paramedics.
&quot;An investigation is under way to establish the exact cause of the fire.&quot;
A spokesman for the fire service said: &quot;Teams in breathing apparatus entered the property to search for anyone inside and sadly they located a woman who had died. 
&quot;Firefighting operations were conducted both inside and outside the house and the fire was brought under control, however due to a partial structural collapse it is likely to be some time before crews can confirm it has been fully extinguished.&quot;

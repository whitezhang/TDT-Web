FIRST Minister Nicola Sturgeon will host a special reception for Glasgow School of Art tonight as part of her first visit to the United States.The event in the New York Public Library for Performing Arts in Lincoln Centre Plaza will bring together around 200 key representatives of the business community, art school graduates based in New York and Scots living in the country.Art school director Professor Tom Inns said: &quot;It is also an opportunity to share our plans for the response to the fire and the restoration programme for the Mackintosh Building.&quot;Ms Sturgeon, said: &quot;The 'Mack' is an extraordinary building. It is an architectural gem and the artistic heart of Glasgow. It was truly heartbreaking to see it in flames.&quot;It can and will be restored and everything which can be done must be done to deliver this. That is why I am hosting this reception in New York, partly to thank some of those in the US for their response and generosity to The Mackintosh Appeal, but also to help raise the profile of the appeal and in part celebrate the life of the Mackintosh building that heralded the birth of modernism.&quot;The recovery and restoration of the 'Mack' will be a long-term process and the Scottish Government is fully committed to supporting this, through the expertise of our specialist staff at Historic Scotland as well as through continued funding support.&quot;However, it will be through the support of all of those who have a deep affinity for The Glasgow School of Art and its great contributions to the art world that will ensure the legacy continues.&quot;The Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on May 23, 2014 but 90% of the building and 70% of its contents were saved.

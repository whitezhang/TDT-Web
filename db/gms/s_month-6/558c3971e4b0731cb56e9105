A 23-year-old man from Glasgow has been killed in a road crash in Turkey.
Ewan Manson was on holiday with friends when he died in the crash in the coastal city of Fethiye on Monday.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed that another British national was injured in the same incident.
The Scottish Youth Theatre, where Mr Manson had previously worked in a freelance capacity, said he was &quot;very talented&quot; and he would be a &quot;great loss to the world of music and theatre&quot;.
In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: &quot;We can confirm the death of a British national in Fethiye, Turkey, on 22 June and the hospitalisation of a second British national involved in the same incident.
&quot;We are providing consular assistance.&quot;
Mary McCluskey, artistic director at the Scottish Youth Theatre, told BBC Scotland that Mr Manson had worked there previously and his death had come as a great shock.
&quot;It's tragic this has happened and our feelings go out to Ewan's parents and the rest of his family, who all have connection with Scottish Youth Theatre,&quot; she said,
&quot;Ewan was an incredibly talented young man and his death will be a great loss to the world of music and theatre.&quot;

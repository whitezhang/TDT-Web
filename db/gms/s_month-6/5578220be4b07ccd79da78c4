THEY might have travelled thousands of miles round the globe but now a pair of inspirational horses have returned home for an annual festival.The Kelpies maquettes, from which the 100ft Falkirk statues were based on, will be on display in Kibble Palace until the end of the month.The exhibition of the 10ft sculptures forms part of this year's West End Festival.They are also the centrepiece of the G20 heritage exhibition.Picture: Colin Templeton

CARERS support services across Glasgow could be threatened by council plans put their contracts out to competitive tender.&nbsp;The national body which represents carers has criticised Glasgow City Council for the moves and said carers have been left &quot;devastated&quot;.Six carers centres across Glasgow provide support services to thousands of carers across the city.These include the South West Carers Centre on Paisley Road West, the South East Carers Centre on Cathcart Road, the West Carers Centre in Anniesland, the North West Carers Centre in Maryhill, the North East Carers Centre in Easterhouse and the East End carers centre in Tollcross.Staff say their services prevent the carers reaching crisis and the person they care for requiring more intensive and costly interventions from the council.Carers fear that if the contracts are subject to the competitive tendering process they maybe lost and funding cut meaning they wouldn't be able to reach as many people as they currently do.Claire Cairns, network coordinator for the Coalition of Carers in Scotland, called on the council to explain why they are changing the terms of the contracts which have not previously been subject to the tendering process.She said only a small number of carers were made aware.Ms Cairns said: &quot;Carers are devastated at the news that their local support services are potentially under threat.&quot;These centres have been providing support to carers for many years and they are an important part of their local communities.&quot;Carers trust them and rely on the services they provide.&quot;Glasgow has yet to give a satisfactory answer as to why they have decided to put these services out to competitive tender.&quot;It is understood that the winning contract could be in place by October.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: “The council’s Internal Audit team indicated in 2013 that contracts for carers’ services should be subject to competitive tendering to ensure compliance with rules at council, national and European level. “Training to help those who manage carer centres understand the new tendering process is available through our Corporate Procurement Unit. “We have gathered a wealth of evidence in recent years which shows that the services we are tendering for are well-received by carers in the city. “Carers will continue to have access to excellent carer services following the tender and we are confident their current providers will be well-placed to submit quality bids.”Councillor David McDonald, deputy leader of Glasgow City Council's SNP group, added: &quot;The six carers centres across the city provide a lifeline service for thousands of unpaid carers who are looking after family or friends.&quot;These centres are well established and greatly valued by carers and the wider community for the range of services they offer from preventative services which stop carers reaching breaking point to assisting carers in applying for benefits and support those their loved ones.&quot;He added: &quot;Carers do an invaluable job, yet they are among those hit hardest by the recession and by previous council cuts.&quot;The SNP Group in the City Chambers is determined to support Glasgow's carers.&quot;We will oppose any attempt to put this service out to tender and will fight to retain this important service.&quot;A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: &quot;

A LEADING lawyer is facing trial, accused of causing the deaths of his wife, daughter and a tourist in a car crash.
Andrew Houston, a &shy;solicitor advocate from Edinburgh, survived the smash that killed his wife Abigail, 42, and seven-year-old daughter Mia.
Dr Mohammad Ali &shy;Hayajneh, 62, from &shy;Duisburg, Germany, was in a car being driven by his wife Ursula.
He died at the scene of the crash, on the A9 at &shy;Newtonmore, Inverness-shire, in July 2013.
Houston, 47, and his elder daughter Lily, 10, survived but were badly injured.
He is a senior partner at McSporrans defence &shy;solicitors in &shy;Edinburgh, and has appeared in courts for more than 20 years.
He qualified as a solicitor advocate in 2004, allowing him to conduct the most serious high court cases.
 

Houston is accused of being at the wheel when his car crossed to the &shy;opposite carriageway into the path of a car driven by Zbigniew Suski, who had to take evasive action. The charge states that Houston’s car then hit Mrs Hayajneh’s vehicle, causing the three deaths.
Houston has pleaded not guilty to causing death by careless driving.
A hearing took place on Tuesday and his trial at Inverness Sheriff Court was set for September.

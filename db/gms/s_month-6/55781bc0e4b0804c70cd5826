Whilst swimming around the ship, the dolphin leaps into the air to heights of 15 feet - and one sailor watches on from the top of the vessel.
The dolphin was making a splash in Moray Firth and photographer Andy Howard was lucky enough to capture him as he stood on Chanonry Point, Fortrose, Scotland.

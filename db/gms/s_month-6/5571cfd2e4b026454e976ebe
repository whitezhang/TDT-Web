CYCLING star Sir Chris Hoy melted the hearts of his Twitter followers by posting his baby son's first passport picture.
 

 
The Olympic champion's son Callum was born 11 weeks early in October 2014 and spent time in intensive care.
Posting the cute snap of the tot on Thursday afternoon, Hoy said: &quot;Callum's first passport photo. Puts a smile on my face just looking at it!&quot;.
In February 2015, proud dad Chris told how his son had tripled his birth weight within three months.

Speaking after Callum's surprise entry into the world , the 38-year-old said: “It was such a surprise when he arrived 11 weeks early. Neither Sarra or I were expecting that.
“He was in incubators, intensive care. But he’s doing really well now. He’s healthy, happy and doing fine.
“He just needs to gain weight, that’s all.”

Mid-tier accountants Baker Tilly have added two senior hires from FTSE 100 firm Aggreko to its Scottish consulting practice.
George Walker joins the firm as an associate director in the technology consulting team and Dougie Graham joins as an associate director in the firm’s business consulting team.
Walker, a qualified Chartered Accountant, was responsible for managing the implementation and roll-out of Aggreko's global enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, including a major upgrade.
He will be based in Baker Tilly's Glasgow office.
Graham, who was programme manager at Aggreko responsible for oversight and implementation of its global Operational Excellence (OE) and IT delivery projects, joins Baker Tilly's Edinburgh office and will cover all areas of the consulting business.
Robert Ross, UK head of consulting for Baker Tilly, said: ‘We are investing significantly in our consulting practice to meet client demand and I am absolutely delighted to welcome George and Dougie on board.
“George has an excellent understanding of the needs and challenges of companies looking to implement or upgrade ERP systems.
“Dougie has been both a business owner and a business consultant, and his real world experience will be a strong draw for our clients.
“Importantly, these new hires mean we are now able to offer a full suite of consulting services to the Scottish market – along with a strengthened ability to deliver IT risk and assurance services to our clients.”

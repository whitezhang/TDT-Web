Rod Stewart: I agree that cooking makes men less masculine... I can't even boil an eggRocker Rod Stewart has said that he stands by his wife's eyebrow-raising comment that cooking makes men less masculine - and admitted that he cannot even boil an egg.Penny Lancaster, 44, sparked controversy when she said earlier this month that men should stay out of the kitchen.Now the Do Ya Think I'm Sexy? singer has told Good Morning Britain: &quot;I couldn't boil an egg to save my life.&quot;I'm embarrassed about it but I've never been in a position where I've had to cook,&quot; the 70-year-old said.&quot;I tend to agree with her and I will agree with her because I've no other option,&quot; he added of Lancaster, whom he wed in 2007.Asked if he used staying masculine as an excuse to avoid the stove, the singer, who wore a floral shirt and checked jacket during his appearance on the ITV show, joked: &quot;My masculinity comes in other departments!&quot;Lancaster sparked controversy when she told Loose Women: &quot;I do agree with equal rights and if women want to go and work that's fabulous.&quot;But she added: &quot;Going as far as cooking and putting the apron on, I think that, not belittles men, but takes the masculinity and I would miss that....We're different... men are from Mars and women are from Venus, testosterone, oestrogen, we're different creatures, I think you've got to let men do it their way...&quot;Stewart also lauded Taylor Swift for successfully taking on Apple - and asked her to tackle Fifa next.The rocker praised the US star after her intervention led the technology giant to perform a u-turn on the issue of paying musicians during a free three-month trial of its streaming service.&quot;I was knocked out with what Taylor Swift did,&quot; he said.&quot;She spoke up and was very brave, she should sort out Fifa,&quot; he said of football's troubled international governing body.And the added: &quot;With the Greek situation last week she could sort out anything....she's gorgeous.&quot;Stewart said of being treated for thyroid cancer several years ago: &quot;I couldn't sing for about three weeks. But the voice came back, albeit an octave lower, so I sing a little lower now than I used to.&quot;

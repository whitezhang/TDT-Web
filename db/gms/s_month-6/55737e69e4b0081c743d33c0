A SOCIAL worker sparked a major security alert at one of Scotland’s toughest jails after losing a set of keys.
Bosses put Barlinnie prison in Glasgow into lockdown after the keys, which open every door in the jail, were handed in by an inmate.
They even considered replacing the locks in the entire building – at a cost of more than &pound;100,000 to the taxpayer.
Barlinnie houses some of the country’s most notorious criminals and wardens were forced to check for potential escapees after ordering inmates back to their cells. The Scottish Prison Service have demanded an urgent investigation.
An inmate found the keys lying in the shower area of the jail’s gym and handed them to a member of staff.
 

It is believed the female social worker did not realise she had lost the keys until a prison officer traced her an hour later.
Prison sources say a warden would face the sack if they lost keys.
Instead, jail chiefs contacted the woman’s employer, Glasgow City Council, and informed them of their employee’s blunder. She returned to work the next day.
A source said: “You can go anywhere you want in Barlinnie with those keys – including out the front door.
“An inmate being in possession of these keys is a serious security breach.”

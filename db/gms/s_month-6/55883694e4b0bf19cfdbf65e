HUGH Grant peers out from Kelvingrove Art Gallery as he films scenes for his latest movie in Glasgow.
The Notting Hill star went jogging in the city's west end before filming scenes for Florence Foster Jenkins which also stars Meryl Streep and Big Bang Theory’s Simon Helberg.
Grant was later seen on location at the renowned Art Gallery and Museum and Kersland Street.
Streep stars as Florence, a real-life New York heiress who dreamed of becoming a great opera singer bit sadly couldn’t sing, while Grant's character St Clair Bayfield was an actor who had an affair with the would-be singer.

Scenes from the film have already been shot in Liverpool.
The Glasgow sets doubled as 1940s New York, with the entrance to Kelvingrove used to replicate Carnegie Hall. Kersland Street in the heart of the city's west end was lined with vintage cars, American lampposts, trash cans and water hydrants.
Philomena director Stephen Friers said he was delighted to be in Scotland for the project.

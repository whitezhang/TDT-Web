THE ELDERLY couple hit by, and then trapped under a bus in central Glasgow last Friday could lose their limbs.
The 76-year-old man and his 72-year-old wife, believed to be from Newcastle, had arrived in Glasgow as part of a holiday coach party.
The two were trapped under the bus in Queen Street.
They are said to have been left with life-changing injuries after being crushed by the vehicle.

Police are still investigating the cause of the crash, but it is understood one line of enquiry being followed is that the pensioners may have been confused by semi-pedestrianised lay-out of the Argyle Street - Queen Street junction.
Their relatives are said to be by their sides at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
The injured couple had to be freed by specialist teams using airbags.
The accident happened just south of the scene of Decemberâ€™s bin lorry tragedy when six people were killed.

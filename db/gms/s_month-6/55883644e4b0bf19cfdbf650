TENS of thousands of protesters across Britain marched &shy;yesterday to demonstrate against Tory austerity cuts.
Organisers said 250,000 marched in London with the crowds including celebrities singer Charlotte Church and comedian Russell Brand.
And in Glasgow’s George Square, union leaders warned they would break the law if the Tory Government introduce new curbs on the right to strike.
The marches were the first major &shy;public protests since the Tories, who are planning more cuts to benefits and public services, won last month’s general election.
Grahame Smith, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, who organised the Glasgow rally, warned cuts were hurting lives and the economy.
He told the 1000-strong rally: “The &shy;consequences of austerity are clear.
“Growing queues at food banks, people forced out of their family homes due to the bedroom tax, good, secure jobs in the public sector replaced by low wage, &shy;insecure work in the private sector.
“We have an economy that is less stable and resilient and a society more unfair and unequal. That is the reality of austerity.”
He also warned that the unions would break the law if Tories banned public service strikes without the support of at least 40 per cent of members.
Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of Unite, said: “Let’s get on the front foot and send a loud and clear message to Cameron and his cronies today. When you come after us, we will fight back.”
Charlotte Church said that austerity is “unethical, unfair and unnecessary” as she marched in London. Asked if she was inspired by the SNP surge in Scotland, she said: “Absolutely.”
She added: “The Scottish have been able to galvanise themselves against the &shy;Westminster elite.”

POLICE hunting a fugitive machete thug admit there hasn't been a single sighting of him since he vanished NINE MONTHS ago.The Evening Times understands Jonathan Kelly, 34, went on the run after failing a drugs test because he feared spending the rest of his life behind bars.There were claims the thug - dubbed one of Scotland's most violent men by insiders - had died, but police believe he is alive and well.Detectives hunting the Drumchapel offender also believe he has been receiving cash and support from pals.Limited intelligence about Kelly's movements, have forced police to admit that, nine months on, they are no closer to catching him.Dozens of Kelly's criminal associates and family members have been quizzed by officers, but he does not appear to have been in touch with anyone since September 10.A police insider said: &quot;All we can do now is keep the pressure up, keep knocking on the same doors and speaking to the same people until someone finally gives him up.&quot;No one claims to have seen him, no one claims to have spoken to him.&quot;But it's only a matter of time. He can't hide forever.&quot;Police have spent more than 710 hours hunting the elusive fugitive, but the force have stayed tight-lipped about the number of officers working on the case.A dedicated team of officers are still assigned to the case and are following up all lines of inquiry in the hope of tracking Kelly down.It is understood Kelly has not been involved in any crime since he went on the run, despite his label as one of the country's most violent men.Detective Superintendent Stevie Grant, who is leading the hunt for Kelly, has vowed to lock up any criminal associates who have been helping him.He said: &quot;It is evident Kelly is being assisted by others - most definitely financially.&quot;Kelly, who paralysed a man with a machete, was freed on licence from Low Moss Prison, near Glasgow, in August with 32 conditions attached, including regular drug tests.He failed a drugs test in the days before he vanished and was set to be returned to jail for at least another decade.He faced a long stretch, with no release until 2024 at the earliest.The Evening Times previously revealed Kelly was acquitted of nine charges at the High Court in Glasgow on August 21.A &pound;5000 reward for information leading to his arrest has been offered.Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.

On track for a cleaner greener cityIF IT feels like your local railway station is looking a little brighter this summer, that’s probably because teams of Streets Ahead volunteers have been hard at work across the city.ScotRail’s commitment to our campaign has meant projects dedicated to improving the city’s stations have blossomed.This year, the organisation also launched an exciting new app designed to help people make a difference in their communities by volunteering.Reach Out, which allows you to search for volunteering opportunities in your community by using your mobile phone or other device, lets you find what appeals to you and register your interest, all in a quick click of the button.ScotRail’s director of corporate social responsibility Elaine Bell said: “At ScotRail, we want to do more to nurture and support our communities, rather than just simply ticking a box.“Reach Out helps us to do something that benefits people and because we carry millions of passengers every year, we can connect with a huge audience that the volunteer sector may find difficult to engage.”Lots of ScotRail’s stations have now been adopted by schools, charities and community groups and the diverse range of initiatives designed to brighten them up is impressive.Over at Duke Street, the fantastic pupils of two local schools – Golfhill Primary and St Denis’s Primary – are still working hard to look after the station.Their artwork and handy gardening skills have transformed the place, while at Pollokshaws Railway station, Streets Ahead awardwinners South West Community Cycles are using the historic building as a base for fantastic initiatives including cycle hire and repair and family events.

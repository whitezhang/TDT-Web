A RACEHORSE trainer says he is on the “scrapheap” after losing a &pound;1million court action over an accident that has left him unable to ride again.
John McShane, 42, is now on benefits. He says he cannot resume his career and has no qualifications to fall back on as he’s been in the racing industry since his teens.
He now has to attend a medical assessment to see if he will qualify for the new Personal Independence Payment due to replace Disability Living Allowance.
Dad-of-one John said: “I’ll never work again in the industry. The money would have made my life easier. I’m devastated. This is a further blow after the accident.”
John was crushed by a horse he was riding on a training track near Strathaven, Lanarkshire in March 2011.
He raised an action at the Court of Session against his employers Burnwynd Racing Stables.
He claimed that the surface of the track was uneven and this caused the horse to fall.
John suffered severe shoulder injuries and had to have three operations. Doctors say if he tries to ride he could lose his left arm.
He lost the case despite being backed by colleague Amanda McCaig who saw the horse fall.
John added: “I’m basically on the scrapheap. If I was a stable boy I’d have received an automatic payout from the industry. As I held a trainers’ licence at the time I’ve been left with nothing.”
In his ruling, Lord Glennie said he did not doubt the honesty of John but said riding horses “involved risk” and did not find any defect on the part of his employer.

A man has been banned from keeping dogs for life after Staffordshire Bull Terrier attacked two dogs and one of their owners.The dog which was under the control of Sean Kinder, 29, attacked the others in separate incidents in his home town of Johnstone, Renfrewshire.Paisley Sheriff Court heard that the dog, first struck in October, attacking a man and his dog leaving them both injured. Then, last September, the animal attacked a labradoodle.Kinder's dog Andy was the subject of a dog control notice meaning he should have been muzzled at all times in public or communal areas.The court heard that the second victim was walking with his dog, when the other bit its shoulder. He tried to separate the dogs.When he appeared in court for sentencing last week, it emerged that Kinder, 29, had been looking after the dog for his girlfriend who had been in jail at the time. The animal had since been given back to her, the court heard.&quot;He is ashamed and saddened and takes responsibility for that - for having a dog which was out on control, said Karen Railton, defending.Kinder had earlier pleaded guilty to breaching Section 3(1) of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 by twice being the owner that was so dangerously out of control it attacked another dog and one of their owners.He had also admitted breaking Section 5(1) of the Control of Dogs (Scotland) Act 2010 by not having a lead or a muzzle on the pet which had since died.Sheriff Colin Pettigrew fined Kinder &pound;600 for the offences, banned him from keeping dogs &quot;for an indefinite period&quot; and gave him a Community Payback Order as a direct alternative to custody, telling him to carry out 240 hours' unpaid work over the next 12 months.

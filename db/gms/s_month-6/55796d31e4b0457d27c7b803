A budget airline pilot branded his passengers “morons” in a Facebook rant and took a selfie in the cockpit wearing a tinfoil “radiation hat”.
Ryanair captain Iain Inglis also joked about running away from a young, bearded man he had spotted “praying quietly to Mecca and kissing the floor at Stansted”.
He made his comments about passengers last month, after the airline changed from free to allocated seating.
Inglis, 31, posted: “To all Ryanair passengers. You now have a seat assignment. So why oh why are you still queuing up like morons!!?? Please locate your brains.”
 

One of his 700 Facebook friends told him: “Normally mate its because if you don’t your bag will be at the other end of the plane!”
The pilot, originally from Edinburgh, made the foil hat after news that 56 minutes at 30,000ft exposed pilots to UV radiation equal to 20 minutes on a sunbed.
Ryanair bosses will not be taking action against the pilot. 
A statement said: “We don’t comment on social media nonsense.”

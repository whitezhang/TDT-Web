SCRABBLING for coins for a parking meter is to become a thing of the past.From Monday, cashless parking will be introduced in the city centre before eventually being rolled out to the rest of Glasgow.Specialist service provider RingGo uses the latest technology to allow people to charge parking directly to their credit or debit card using their mobile phone.Drivers can also top up their parking time without returning to the car and have the option of being sent a reminder text message.To use the service, motorists will be asked for the number plate, the colour and make of the vehicle, the location it is parked in, how long they want to stay and payment card details.Once registered, RingGo recognises the mobile phone and retrieves information previously given.That means drivers only have to provide a location code which is shown on local signs, the length of time they want to park and a three digit security code.It is possible to use the service by smartphone app, by phoning, by text message or by the internet.The new service will be rolled out across the city from June 8, starting with the city centre on-street pay and display machines.More than 6million people across the UK in 225 towns and cities use RingGo to pay for parking. It is presently used by 95 local authorities as an alternative to pay and display.Alistair Watson, the city council's sustainability and transport spokesman, said: &quot;This is great news for drivers in Glasgow.&quot;The new system offers a quick and easy way to park for parking. It is fast, straightforward and convenient.&quot;I am sure this cashless parking service will be welcomed by everyone who regularly parks in the city.&quot;It will also reduce the number of parking machines in the city. We have more than 1000 pay and display machines and as part of this programme, we will see that number fall, as well as associated costs.&quot;Drivers can pre-register for the service either by using the RingGo smartphone apps which are downloadable free of charge or on the internet at www.myRingGo.uk/registerTo register at the time you want to park either use the RingGo app or call 0141 530 3303.There is no charge for registering with RingGo and no charge for downloading or using the smartphone app but drivers will pay 20p on top of the normal parking tariff charge.To see a video of how to register and pay with go to www.myRingGo.co.uk/howitworks

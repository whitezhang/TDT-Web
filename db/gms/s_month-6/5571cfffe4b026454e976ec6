A STALKER shoved a wedding dress through a terrified neighbour’s letterbox and begged her to marry him.
David Irvine, 55, started harassing Grace Somerville soon after he moved into the Motherwell street where she lives last year.
For weeks, he made indecent comments to her when he passed her in the neighbourhood.
Then Grace arrived home one day to discover a black-and-white pleated dress had been pushed through her letterbox.
She later quizzed Irvine about it and was stunned when he said it was for her to wear on their wedding day.
He told her he had bought the dress for &pound;75 from a charity shop and also showed her a veil and a pair of high heels.
 

 

A source said: “He had become obsessed with her and she was really scared.
“One day she was leaving her street and he appeared and went down on one knee to propose to her.”
Shocked Grace went to the police and Irvine admitted causing a breach of the peace between August and September last year when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court.
Yesterday he was admonished by Sheriff Douglas Brown after the court heard he had been of good behaviour for the past six months.
Irvine, who also has a conviction for making hoax 999 calls, is banned from approaching Grace after being placed on a non-harassment order.

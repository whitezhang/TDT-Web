A LUXURY Highland estate is to be sold at auction – with &pound;12million knocked off the asking price.
The 547-acre Eilean Aigas is being offered for sale for offers over &pound;3million – down from the original 2012 selling price of &pound;15million.
It is owned by Canadian telecoms billionaire Brendan Clouston, who was a close friend of Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
 

The estate’s mansion – only built in the last 10 years – boasts eight bedroom suites, a private cinema and magnificent reception rooms.
There is also a renovated original four bedroom house, new gate lodge and estate office with staff accommodation.
It is thought Clouston’s decision to sell came after he failed to stop super pylons being built near the site.
 

But he insisted: “I have decided to sell Eilean Aigas because my wife and I have development project in Guernsey.
We love Inverness-shire and have made wonderful friends here, so we’ll miss many things about our life in the Highlands.”
The property is being sold by Savills in London in September.
 

Evelyn Channing, of Savills, said: “The family have invested an enormous amount of time, resource and effort into creating and renewing more than 500 acres of historic and beautiful landscape while protecting wildlife.
“The auction is likely to attract a great deal of national and international attention.”

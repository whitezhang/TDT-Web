Improving Glasgow one community at a timeSINCE signing up to our campaign four years ago, Scottish Fire and Rescue has been dedicated to helping us build a better Glasgow, one street at a time.Its hardworking crews have taken our message out into their communities and the results have been fantastic.This year, their incredible Commonwealth Games legacy project took the city by storm, bringing neighbours together and engaging with young people from all over Glasgow.The main strand of the campaign was the Commonwealth Statues project. Working with prisoners from Barlinnie Prison, the service installed beautiful sporting-themed statues outside all 11 of the city’s community fire stations.Each one is based on a different sport, including bowling, judo, swimming and athletics. Around each statue, the fire crews also created mini-gardens. The next stage of the project is to involve local schools in the naming of the statues, and the maintenance of the gardens.Firefighters also helped young people volunteer outside some of the main Commonwealth Games venues last summer. As part of a thank-you celebration, they were invited into Cowcaddens Community Fire Station to receive certificates.George McGrandles, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s area manager, explained: “The young people, from seven city schools, helped us spread the message of fire safety at the Games – this was a chance for us to reach neighbourhoods of our city, enabling us to build on the work we are already doing in our communities.”The young people’s efforts were also recognised by the Glasgow volunteers branch of the Saltire Awards, a national volunteering agency.

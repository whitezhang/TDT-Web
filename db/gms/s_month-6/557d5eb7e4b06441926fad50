MARK WARBURTON is set to pen a deal to become the new Rangers manager in the next 24 hours, according to reports.
 The former Brentford boss is set to be assisted by ex-Rangers skipper David Weir , but there isn’t expected to be a place for Ian Cathro. 

 Cathro left his job as a coach at La Liga side Valencia earlier this week to fuel speculation of a move to Ibrox, but he isn’t expected to take up a role in Rangers’ new managerial team. 
It was announced in February that Warburton, a former City trader, was to leave Brentford and he could now be on his way to Glasgow.
 The deal is expected to be confirmed in the next 24 hours and he will replace Stuart McCall who failed to secure promotion back to the Premiership after a 6-1 aggregate defeat to Motherwell.

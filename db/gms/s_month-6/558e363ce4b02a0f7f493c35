Glasgow bin lorry crash: Trust fund pays Â£165,000 to victims and families of those killedA TRUST find set up in the aftermath of the bin lorry tragedy has given money to 15 injured victims and families of the six people killed.Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, died when the bin lorry lost control in the city's Queen Street and George Square days before Christmas last year.Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were also killed when the truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.More people were injured in the tragic incident which is to be the subject of a Fatal Accident Inquiry starting next month.In the aftermath of the devastating crash, The Lord Provost's Queen Street Fund was established by Glasgow City Council to &quot;relieve suffering and distress among the dependents of the deceased and also those injured in the incident&quot;.To date it has collected a total of &pound;220,184 in pledges and donations.And the fund, which is administered by trustees - including Lord Provost Sadie Docherty and council leader Gordon Matheson - has given out &pound;165,000 so far.This was shared among the families of each of the six people killed as well as well five people who suffered severe injuries with long-term effects and a further 10 people who suffered less serious injuries.The fund is now due to close on Tuesday and money left will be split between the existing recipients.Anyone who still wishes to donate has until the end of the month to do so.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: &quot;The trust fund is not intended to act as a substitute for insurance or compensation for injury or loss.&quot;Instead, it can be considered an expression of support from the community to those involved in the incident.&quot;Within hours of opening, the fund had received generous support from across Glasgow, the United Kingdom and beyond.&quot;Glasgow City Council has met all costs associated with the creation and administration of the fund.It is subject to independent audit, and services are provided at no cost by Scott-Moncrieff.When the appeal was established, trustees agreed categories that identified how and to what extent each individual was affected.The four categories are: family of the deceased; severe injury or incapacitated long-term; moderate injury or incapacitated medium-term; and lesser injury, moderate trauma or incapacitated short-term.The highest approved payments were made in the first category.The council spokesman added: &quot;The fund is scheduled to close at the end of June and final balances will be disbursed to the existing recipients shortly thereafter.&quot;Anyone carrying out fundraising, or who wishes to make a donation, should make arrangements to pay into the Fund by Tuesday, June 30.&quot;Donations can be made at any bank using Sort Code 834400 and Account Number 10809775.&quot;Cash or cheque donations can be made in person at the council's Service Desk at 45 John Street, Glasgow, G1 1JE.&quot;

Camilla visits Glasgow credit unionNEW royal Princess Charlotte is to be welcomed into Glasgow’s growing family of credit union savers.The tiny tot joined thousands of young people from across the city in the pioneering Future Savers scheme when her grandmother, Camilla, the Duchess of Rothesay, visited GlasgowShe took part in a credit union fair at the city’s Trades Hall and met some of the members and staff who have helped make Glasgow the credit union capital of Britain.During the visit, Camilla was presented with personalised money banks for Princess Charlotte, Prince George and each of her other grandchildren.City Treasurer Paul Rooney saud: “Her Royal Highness is a great advocate for credit unions – and also a member – so her visit is a wonderful opportunity to show just how strong the sector is in Glasgow.“We are Britain’s credit union capital and we have members from every walk of life and in every community in the city.“That has not happened by accident. Our credit unions have shown huge determination to grow; to professionalise their products and services, and to reach for self-sufficiency.“We will continue to back them and work with them to grow and flourish – and I’m delighted to welcome Her Royal Highness and her grandchildren into that family.”In 2001, Glasgow City Council launched an innovative and ambitious programme to develop credit unions as professional and credible alternatives for citizens – including those suffering financial exclusion, poverty and debt.Membership grew rapidly, along with the capability and capacity of the city’s 34 credit unions and, today, around one in five Glaswegians has an account – compared to around one in seventy elsewhere in the country. The city’s successful approach is now regarded as a model of best practice.The city council has invested more than &pound;8 million in the sector – supporting marketing, training, organisational development and service development – and provided direct financial support for credit unions to move into high street premises and to meet staff and running costs.It now offers a 50% concessionary rental rate for credit unions based in council-owned property and all Glasgow credit unions get 100% relief on non-domestic rates.One of the city’s most recent innovations has been Future Savers; a programme that responds to concerns about the use of high-cost payday lenders by giving thousands of school pupils their first savings account, with a &pound;10 deposit paid by Glasgow City Council.Every year, the city gains new credit union members. They are encouraged to save – and if, as adults, they need to borrow they will already have a relationship with a responsible lender.Since launching in 2013, the project has already been adopted by a number of other authorities the length and breadth of Britain.

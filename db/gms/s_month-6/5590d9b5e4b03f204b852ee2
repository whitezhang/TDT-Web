Care services across Glasgow could suffer because of new shifts, say Cordia workers and UnisonUNION officials and workers fear care services across Glasgow could go into &quot;meltdown&quot; because of changes in staff shift patterns.Cordia home care workers are in dispute with bosses at the Glasgow City Council arms length organisation over changes to their working hours, with some asked to do seven days on and seven days off.Those who objected to the new plans, some for medical reasons, say they have been told they will be removed from the areas they working in, and their regular clients, and put into a pool which would see them deployed anywhere across the city.But the staff - some of which who have up to 30 years experience with the company - say this will leave clients without the carers they have built relationships with and workers now face having to find their way around parts of the city they do not know.The new shifts are due to start today.One worker, who is set to be taken away from her regular clients because she did not sign up to the new working pattern, told the Evening Times: &quot;It is the vulnerable people that we care for that are going to suffer.&quot;Many of my clients have dementia and are in their 80's and they really depend on having a familiar face around.&quot;The whole thing has been managed terribly. I fear the system will go into meltdown.&quot;Another worker added: &quot;It feels like we are being punished because we did not sign up to the new shift patterns.&quot;But I could not work seven days in a row for medical reasons.&quot;Unison is advising members to take out grievances against the company over the way they have been treated.Sam Macartney from Unison's Glasgow City branch said: &quot;We are taking about some of the most caring people you could meet.&quot;The work force is predominantly female and they have family commitments of their own so to take them out of the areas they have been working in is unfair.&quot;We also have the prospect of lone female workers having to find their way around parts of they are unfamilar with late at night.He added: &quot;On Friday some staff were still unaware there they were due to be working on Monday.&quot;This is disaster awaiting to happen.&quot;A spokesman for Cordia said: “The vast majority of our service users receive support seven days a week and it makes sense to have staff consistently available to meet that demand.“Previously, service users could easily have different carers during the day, in the evening or over the weekend.“The new arrangements will ensure greater continuity of care for service users as they will now regularly receive their support from just two sets of carers.“Service users will experience no reduction in service, which will continue to be delivered by a fully qualified staff.“We expect there will be a short period of transition and we hope people can bear with us while the new arrangements bed in.”

Streets Ahead helping to make Glasgow shineTHE fourth, fantastic year of Streets Ahead helped Glasgow to shine.Launching in the wake of the warm glow cast by the Commonwealth Games, our campaign grew as the city continued to sparkle.With the support of our generous partners, City Charitable Trust, Clean Glasgow, Scottish Fire and Rescue, ScotRail and Glasgow Housing Association, we helped communities change for the better.Glasgow’s men, women and children rallied together on a host of incredible and inspiring projects designed to bring neighbours together and improve neighbourhoods forever.We launched with a whole host of projects already underway, inspired by the summer’s Commonwealth Games.Many communities decided the legacy of the Games should be a cleaner, safer and friendlier city – so community gardens and Commonwealth-themed activities sprung up all over the place.Leading the way was Scottish Fire and Rescue, whose Commonwealth Statues project was a beautiful, lasting reminder.Working with prisoners at Barlinnie, local schoolchildren and partners such as Glasgow City Council, fire crews created 11 sports-themed statues and mini-gardens at all of the city’s community fire stations.Fitting with our plans to broaden Streets Ahead beyond gardening and environmental projects, we also heard about fantastic initiatives driven by our campaign partners ScotRail and Glasgow Housing Association.ScotRail’s Reach Out app helped people find volunteering roles in their communities, benefitting local charities and organisations – and the volunteers themselves.Glasgow Housing Association helped residents in some of the poorest areas of Glasgow with its inspirational Click and Connect service.The organisation’s parent company, Wheatley Group, in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College, supports 30 new or upgraded centres providing free internet access and learning support to more than 8500 people over the next few years.It was a busy year for community clean ups, driven by the dedicated teams at Clean Glasgow, with residents turning out in force in every corner of the city to pick up litter, tidy up parks and transform high streets.Schools, who have been at the heart of our campaign since we launched in 2011, once again enthusiastically supported us with a fantastic array of inspirational projects.For example, Ibrox Primary ran regular litter picks in the streets surrounding the south side school and received a Streets Ahead grant of &pound;1000 for a mini –orchard to grow and harvest food.Community organisations also got behind our campaign and our funding helped to kick-start dream projects.We gave &pound;2000 to Little Roots @ Ruchill, a beautiful garden and growing space at the back of the area’s community centre, to help them develop the range of services they offer residents.And we provided the Southern Necropolis Action Group with a &pound;2000 grant to help them continue their excellent work in the famous graveyard.Our network of Street Champions – dedicated volunteers who look after a particular area and report on anything needing done – is growing.And the simple idea which started our campaign in the first place – that one person can change a street, and one person on every street can change a city – continues to inspire people all over Glasgow.For more information on how you can get involved, visit www.eveningtimes.co.uk, email streetsahead@eveningtimes.co.uk or call 0141 302 6555.

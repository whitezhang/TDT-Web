 Leeds United have signed Motherwell striker Lee Erwin on a three-year deal. 
 He scored five league goals in 2014-15 for the Steelmen, who avoided relegation to the Scottish Championship after a play-off win over Rangers. 
 Erwin was involved in the fracas at the end of the second leg that saw Rangers defender Bilel Mohsni handed a four-match ban for punching the 21-year-old. 
 The Fir Park side will be entitled to compensation after Erwin turned down a new deal to join the Championship side. 
 He told BBC Radio Leeds: &quot;I'm absolutely over the moon and I can't wait to get started. It's amazing. 
 &quot;Once Leeds came to me it was really hard to say no. They're a huge club and the stadium and training facilities are brilliant.&quot; 
 Erwin is the second player to join Leeds in two days after Cardiff goalkeeper Charlie Horton joined on Tuesday. 
 Motherwell boss Ian Baraclough added: &nbsp; &quot;We are obviously disappointed to lose a player like Lee and I told the lad himself I think he would've benefited from a further year playing week to week in our first-team. 
 &quot;However, with that all being said, I understand how football works and Leeds United is a great club with a great tradition and it's a big opportunity for him.&quot;

A CANADIAN groom spent a night of his honeymoon in police cells after being arrested for a bust up in a Glasgow street with his new wife.&nbsp;Andrew Sutherland, 28, was lifted by police in the early hours of the morning for grabbing hold of his partner, Stephanie, during a late-night altercation.The pair were returning to their accommodation in Glasgow's west end when they were spotted by neighbours arguing.He was seen grabbing her and the concerned onlookers called the police and his wife flagged down a delivery driver who also contacted the police.He was later arrested and charged and admitted at Glasgow Sheriff Court assaulting Mrs Sutherland by grabbing her on the body and clothes, and shaking her.A not guilty plea to a charge of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner was accepted by prosecutors.Admonishing Sutherland sheriff Anthony Deutsch told him: &quot;Be nice to your wife for the rest of the honeymoon&quot;.The couple married on May 17 and are visiting Scotland as part of their honeymoon.The court heard they had been in a number of pubs in the city drinking, but at one point Sutherland left when a man tried to chat up his wife.Around 3.55am the following morning the pair were arguing on Maryhill Road which attracted the attention of nearby neighbours.They saw Sutherland - a restaurant manager from Ontario - with his hands on the scruff of Mrs Sutherland's neck and was shaking her.The police were called but when they arrived the couldn't see anybody matching the description.Around an hour and a half later police were called to Clarendon Street to a female who had flagged down a Tesco driver.She told police what happened but refused to give a statement. Sutherland appeared a short time later and was detained, and taken to Stewart Street police office.He was later interviewed and charged before making his court appearance.Sutherland - who was represented by defence lawyer Ian Sievwright - cannot remember his wife being spoken to by a male, or the reason for the argument in the street.His visibly upset wife was in court when the case called and she told the sheriff she was desperate to have him back.Sutherland was admonished and later left the court to continue on his honeymoon.

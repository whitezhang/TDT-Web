'Til death us do part - wedding at the Southern NecropolisFEW brides would jump at the chance to get married in a cemetery – but for Elsie Mackie, it was a dream come true.Elsie, nee Reid, and her new husband Colin tied the knot on Saturday in the grand surroundings of the Southern Necropolis in the Gorbals – the first couple ever to do so.Elsie said: “I know some people might thing – ooh, I couldn’t get married in a graveyard, but everyone who knows us understands why we chose this as our venue – and it was perfect.”Elsie and Colin are founder members of SNAG – the Southern Necropolis Action Group, supporters of the Evening Times Streets Ahead campaign.The hardy bunch of volunteers are dedicated to restoring the famous graveyard – which includes the final resting places of legendary grocer Sir Thomas Lipton and architect Alexander Greek Thomson – to its former glory.Elsie said: “We are in here every week, weeding, litter-picking and tidying, so when Colin suggested we get married here, it seemed perfect.&quot;Restoring the Southern Necropolis has been a passion of Colin’s since he was at school.He said: “My guidance teacher, Charlotte Hutt, inspired me – she was very keen to see the graveyard restored.“One of her dreams was to see a wedding take place here, and that always stuck in my mind.“Sadly Charlotte died a few years ago – but I think she was looking down on us today.”Colin arrived at the cemetery on a coach, with 50 invited family and friends – many did not know where they were heading for.Elsie, in an ivory lace and chiffon gown, and her four bridesmaids, were waiting for him.The ceremony, conducted by Gallowgate minister the Reverend Peter Davage, took place on the Franciscan Circle opposite the Gatehouse entranceway, said to be above the burial place of several Franciscan monks.Elsie, 50, who is originally from the Gorbals, and Colin, 51, from Oatlands, met at a school reunion for Adelphi Secondary.Elsie said: “Some of Colin’s fascination for this place has rubbed off on me.“I know it’s not for every bride, but it’s lovely to get married in such a historic place.”The couple were keen to be respectful of the venue and far from it being a ‘novelty’ wedding, the simple ceremony was a beautiful tribute to their historic surroundings.Their only concession to the quirkiness of the event was a slightly spooky cake.Elsie said: “We decided to make the toppers a bride and groom, who were skeletons, everyone loved it.”Colin added: “We know it’s a bit different, but it was our decision, our wedding and we loved every second of it.&quot;After all, there can’t be too many people who can say they had 250,000 ex-residents of Glasgow at their wedding.”

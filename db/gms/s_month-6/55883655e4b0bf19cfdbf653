KEIRA PROCTER feels like she’s been stitched up after commissioning a pair of designer jeans.
She paid Glasgow maker Rabbie Denim &pound;300 more than a year ago but they have not delivered.
She finally called me in after owner Robert Watson would not return her calls.
Keira, a paraplegic and permanent wheelchair user, said: “I’ve had a year of Rabbie Denim breaking their word.”
The 33-year-old, a returning customer, paid &pound;300 by bank transfer in May 2014 and expected her order within six months.
But Keira, who suffered a spinal injury in 2002, said: “ I kept receiving excuses via text from Robert Watson.
“He had a broken thumb, I was still at the bottom of a 26-pair list, he’d moved the business into storage, he was having root canal treatment. You name it, I heard it.”
Finally, after 11 months, a pair of jeans arrived. But Keira, of Dunoon, Argyll, returned them and demanded a refund when they didn’t fit.
She said: “They were tiny and didn’t even come over my knees.”
Since then, she has been unable to reach Watson. She said: “He has blocked all contact with me.
“He answered when I called from a friend’s mobile but hung up once my name was mentioned.”
It’s not the first time Rabbie Denim have come across my radar. I previously told how Bob Smith had a problem after paying a &pound;200 deposit for jeans.
When I got on to Watson, he said: “I will refund the money as soon as I can, by the end of July, as I can’t afford it now.
“I spent a while making her one-offs. The first pair I made for her were spot-on so I don’t know why the second pair wouldn’t be.
“When they didn’t fit, I wanted to fix them but I don’t drive and she’s in a wheelchair. So I told her I’d refund her when I could afford it.”

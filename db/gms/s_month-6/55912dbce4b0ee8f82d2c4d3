The Scottish Power youth series allows Scotland’s best young cyclists to become accustomed to competition and hone their racing tactics.&nbsp;I hope some young local people will see how exciting racing can be and decide to take up the sport for themselves.”&nbsp;A number of promising young&nbsp; Glasgow Riderz&nbsp;are already signed up for the race, including Geoff Vera in the U10 boys, James Ballantyne in the U12 boys, Imani Pereira-James in the U12 girls and Jack Cruden in the U14 boys.

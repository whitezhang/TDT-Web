THE University of Glasgow is setting up a memorial fun to celebrate the life of former student and rector Charles Kennedy.
The fund would be used to name a major teaching area or lecture theatre in the planned new Learning and Teaching building at the institution after the one-time LibDem leader.
Principal and Vice Chancellor Professor Anton Muscatelli said: “We feel that this would be a fitting and permanent tribute to Charles’ life and work at the heart of a student-centred building.”
The plan has the full support of Kennedy’s family, said the university in a statement.
A memorial service will be held at the university’s Bute Hall on Thursday, June 18, at 7pm. It will be led by University Chaplain, the Reverend Stuart MacQuarrie, and is open to all.
Doors will open at 6.30pm and the high numbers expected might mean not everyone can be accommodated. An overflow facility will be available in the Kelvin Gallery.

Dozens of weapons including knives and tools seized by police from Glasgow school pupilsPOLICE seized dozens of weapons, including knives and household tools, from pupils in Glasgow schools in the last four academic years.Officers were called out to pupils carrying nearly 50 weapons in schools in the Greater Glasgow area between 2012 and the present day.Just 10 days ago the Evening Times reported that police had encouraged parents to search their children’s school bags in case they were stashing weapons.It came after three 12-year-old boys were found with knives in three different schools in the east of the city on two days.So far this year there have been six weapon carrying incidents reported to police, including the three earlier this month.Last year police seized nine weapons, seven of them knives, and the previous year there were 19 weapons seized.In 2012, 11 knives and three other weapons - such as catapults - were confiscated.Earlier this year a teenager was rushed to hospital following a suspected stabbing at a school in the South Side of Glasgow.Police were called out at lunchtime amid reports that two 14-year-old boys were injured in the disturbance.A spokeswoman from the Scottish Government, which funds the No Knives Better Lives (NKBL) youth programme, said there were a “number of dangers of young people carrying knives, in particular at school”.She added: “That is why as part of building safer communities, we are continuing to work with partners at a national and local level to reduce violence and tackle knife crime in Scotland.“Our priority is to prevent all forms of abuse and violence, to change the culture in which some people think that carrying a knife is acceptable.”The spokeswoman added that violent crime had decreased in Scotland by 10 per cent between 2012/13 and 2013/14 but that “one knife crime is one too many”.The spokeswoman said Police Scotland’s campus officers were trained as part of the NKBL campaign to help young people make better choices to stop them from carrying weapons.Teaching unions say there must be a zero tolerance approach to weapon carrying.Larry Flanagan, the Education Institute of Scotland (EIS) general secretary, said: “Clearly, in serious cases such as those where a pupil brings a weapon into school with intent to cause harm, this must be dealt with swiftly and firmly, including police involvement where physical harm is caused or threatened.“There is no justification for any pupil to bring a weapon into school with intent to cause harm and a zero tolerance approach must be adopted in such circumstances.”Sergeant Caroline Harden from the Safer Communities Unit said : &quot;There is never an excuse for carrying a weapon and we will continue to work tirelessly with all of our partners, including the Violence Reduction Unit, to change the culture in which some people think that carrying a weapon is acceptable.“Police Scotland continues to regularly engage with young people on the dangers of weapons carrying.“Greater Glasgow Policing Division, through the Safer Communities Unit, is working in partnership with Community Safety Glasgow (CSG), to jointly promote and deliver the Scottish Governments’ ‘No Knives Better Lives’ (NKBL) programme in Glasgow and Greater Glasgow.“We regularly promote this hard-hitting material at community events and to youth and school groups across Greater Glasgow’s three Council areas.&quot;Figures published at the end of 2014 showed 181 weapons were seized in schools across Scotland during 2013/14.Dangerous items confiscated after pupils either used or threatened to use them included pen knives, stones, pool cues, a hacksaw and the branch of a tree.Some of the items were confiscated in nurseries and from primary one pupils, while more of the serious weapons were removed from youngsters up to the age of 17.

STRIKING homelessness workers have rejected a pay deal from the council.Trades union Unison branded the offer by Glasgow City Council to give 70 homelessness case workers a wage rise by increasing their pay grade on the condition they pass a competency test an &quot;insult&quot;.The staff have been on strike for nearly 12 weeks in the dispute over their pay grade.The homelessness case workers argue that they do a job equivalent to case workers in other departments who are on a higher pay grade, taking home &pound;5000 a year more.A spokesman for the council said &quot;We are bitterly disappointed that Unison has rejected this fantastic opportunity for their members to gain a pay rise in excess of &pound;5000 and advance their careers.&quot;The offer was open to all of the striking caseworkers and was subject only to those staff demonstrating their competence at the new grade.&quot;However Unison convener Ian Leech said there was an issue of distrust between the strikers and the staff.Mr Leech said the competency test was understood to be an interview.He said: &quot;The workers have already displayed their competence so to offer them an interview after nearly 12 weeks of striking is a bit of an insult.&quot;We had a discussion about that proposal and the staff said they didn't want to hear anymore.&quot;Our members feel the council is trying to divide them with this offer.&quot;Mr Leech said the strike was &quot;solid&quot; and members would continue to fight for a pay grade increase.The city council spokesman added that bosses wanted to make sure staff were at the level Unison says they are.He said: &quot;Unison say their members are already doing a job that merits a grade 6 salary and we simply wish to ensure that all staff are able to work at that level before moving on.&quot;We have already agreed with Unison that in the long term the number of caseworkers working at the grade six level should be 54 members of staff.&quot;Recent discussions have been about how we move towards that figure in the intervening period as well as the training and support we would provide for staff looking to move up a pay grade.&quot;

Run adds a splash of colour in GlasgowGRINNING runners in Glasgow were treated to a &quot;tsunami of colour&quot; as they took part in a 5K run with a difference.Hundreds of runners took part in the Color Me Rad run through Glasgow Green in the city centre yesterday.Described by organisers as an &quot;un-timed, non-competitive fun run with loads of colour&quot; runners started in waves at 10am.Wearing white t-shirts, they were then then bombarded with blue, green, pink, purple and yellow &quot;colour bombs&quot; throughout the course.At the finish line, runners threw their own bombs -- made of non-toxic, coloured cornstarch -- to get into the party mood and were treated to food and music.And even the rain couldn't put a dampener on the occasion, voicing their enthusiasm on Twitter.One runner tweeted: &quot;Got blue eyebrows and a yellow hairline. But #colormerad was awesome. Again next year!&quot;Another said: &quot;A yellow bath, sneezing orange and I am still a slight tinge of green after two showers! Loved #colormerad&quot;.One bystander tweeted: &quot;There are a lot of colourful-looking people in Glasgow today. They've obviously been at Colour Me Rad - or had a nasty accident in B&amp;Q.&quot;The races have become very popular in recent years with several events staged throughout the summer in cities across the UK.Runners could also donate money to the race's charity partner, Radio Clyde's Cash for Kids, which has been raising money for children and local communities across Glasgow and the West.

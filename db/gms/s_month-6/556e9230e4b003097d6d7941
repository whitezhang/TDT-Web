Now I've heard about Orangefest I'm dreading it.&quot;Julie McLean Tweeted: &quot;Boggles my mind how things like Orangefest are allowed to go ahead.

Avoid town. Head for the hills.&quot;A petition was launched online yesterday morning, calling for the city council to explain why the event had been given permission.The &quot;Hold GCC to account on Orangefest - the people of Glasgow say 'No More!&quot; said the people of Glasgow and Scotland were &quot;sick of their voices going unheard in relation to sectarian, hate filled orange marches.&quot;&quot;We demand that GCC answer to the people of Glasgow as to why this was allowed to go ahead in a city centre location on a busy Saturday.&quot; More than 3500 people had signed it yesterday afternoon.The Orange Order said they were confident there would not be any problems.Edward Hyde, Grand Master of the County Grand Orange Lodge Of Glasgow, said they were inviting other religions in an effort to &quot;break down some divides.&quot;He said two women representatives from the Catholic Church would be attending, plus an Irish consulate and a representative from the Muslim Council for Scotland.He said they had hired stewards to patrol the square and he was confident there would not be any trouble.He said there would be a kids zone with face painting and a bouncy castle and the event was family friendly.He added: &quot;We contacted as many faith groups as we could.&quot;I'm confident this is a step forward. We want to dispel some of the myths.&quot;I've not had one adverse comment from anyone about inviting other faiths.&quot;It's a case of opening up our doors, showing it's not about walking up and down the streets banging a big drum.&quot;A spokesman for the city council said: &quot;People use George Square and other public spaces in Glasgow for a range of events and activities.&quot;Providing the events are properly planned and don't encourage unlawful behaviour the council is not permitted to simply ban them on the grounds that someone dislike aspects or holds contrary views to the organisers.&quot;Opposition politicians in Glasgow have called on the local authority to declare how much it is spending on the event.Mr Hyde said it was funded by the Orange Order. He said: &quot;No funds have been received from Glasgow City Council.&quot;The council said permission had been given for the event which goes through separate legislation to processions in the city.As well as bands, prayers, a Last Night At The Prom-style concert and speeches, academic and journalist Ruth Dudley Edwards will be speaking. Former top flight football referee Mike McCurry was contacted to help organise a segment of the day.

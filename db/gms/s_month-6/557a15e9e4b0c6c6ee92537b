THE man who had the world's first penis transplant is to become a dad.
The girlfriend of the 21-year-old South African revealed she is expecting their first child.
Doctors said they were delighted and it showed the &quot;complete success&quot; ofthe operation.
The recipient - who has not been named - received the new organ last year after a botched circumcision operation. The couple's baby is due in October.
Doctor Andre van der Merwe performed the ground breaking operation. Yesterday he gave a lecture on the success of the operation.
He said: &quot;Initially we had no financial backing, no donors and manycritics, but I am now happy to hear the recipient's girlfriend is now four months pregnant.&quot;
 

Van der Merwe says he is looking forward to performing more peniletransplants.
The ground-breaking operation took a team of surgeons nine hours and has allowed the patient to be sexually active.

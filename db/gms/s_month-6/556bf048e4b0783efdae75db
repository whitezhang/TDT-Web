WHEN he was just three days old Cormac Stewart was diagnosed with a serious heart condition and his tiny body underwent a life saving operation.Aged three he was given a donor artery during open heart surgery.And now, nine-years-old and facing the prospect of more surgery, the remarkable boy is determined to do all he can to help children who he thinks are sicker than him.For the last three years Cormac, who is a pupil at St Benedicts School in Easterhouse, has taken part in the Helping Hearts Family 5k in aid of Heart Research UK - most recently at Strathclyde Park on Saturday - and has also helped raise money for Yorkhill, Ronald McDonald House and the Children's Heart Foundation along with his parents.Alistair, 46, said: &quot;He always says he wants to help other kids who are worse than him and I tell him that there aren't many who have been through what he has.&quot;The has three large scars on his chest and he knows that he got them when the doctors fixed his heart which was broken when he was born, though he can't remember anything.&quot;But the memory of what he lived through it still vivid in the minds of his parents.Alistair said: &quot;Cormac was just days old when he started to turn blue.&quot;Doctors at the Royal in Glasgow diagnosed him with pulmonary atresia.&quot;Pulmonary atresia is a condition where blood cannot flow between the right chamber of the heart into the lungs to pick up oxygen.His dad added: &quot;Rosemary had five miscarriages before we had Cormac, so he was scanned regularly throughout her pregnancy but this was not picked up.&quot;Doctors did discover that he wasn't growing the way he should have been so he was delivered early via a c-section.&quot;Then when he was five days old they had to open him from the middle left had side of his chest to the left side of his back and fit a shunt in his heart to try to correct the problem.&quot;But this didn't work, which we understand is quite unusual.&quot;So when he was seven days old they had to repeat the operation on the other side.&quot;Alistair added: &quot;This was so challenging for us but we had to try and stay positive.&quot;There was a little boy in the opposite bed in Yorkhill who was dying and no one knew what was wrong with him.&quot;I remember thinking that yes it was terrible what Cormac was going through but the doctors knew what was wrong and it was operable.&quot;When he was three, little Cormac was fitted with a donor artery during successful open heart surgery.The brave toddler's parents were stunned to see how quickly his condition improved and when just days later he was up, playing in the ward.Alistair added: &quot;I remember him pushing his IV around on its stand, desperate to play. We couldn't keep him in his bed.&quot;Cormac has gone from strength to strength since then.Alistair added: &quot;We asked the doctor after operation if there was anything he wouldn't be able to do and they said no.&quot;They warned us that he might get tired quicker than other children but that was all.&quot;From this point on we were determined to let him lead a normal, active life and made the decision not to wrap him in cotton wool.&quot;Three years ago, Cormac decided to take part in the Helping Hearts family 5k event in Motherwell.The youngster also recently made and sold Loom bands to friends and family in aid of Yorkhill and dad Alistair has taken part in a number of fundraisers over the years.The family haven't tallied to total of the funds raised but try to do what they can throughout the year.Alistair said: &quot;Cormac felt it was important to help other children like himself and knew that taking part in the 5k was a way he could make a positive impact.&quot;He just takes his time around the track, walking and jogging.&quot;Cormac plays football, takes part in karate classes, goes to Boys Brigade and generally likes to &quot;run around daft&quot;, said his dad.Alistair added: &quot;He is such a remarkable wee boy and he's doing really well in school - he wants to become a heart surgeon/flighter pilot.&quot;We are so proud of him.&quot;

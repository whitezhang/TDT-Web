SCOTS swear-jar-filler Gordon Ramsay and wife Lana shared a smacker in front of a cheering crowd after completing a gruelling Ironman in Staffordshire.
The pair shared a huge celebratory kiss after both crossed the finish line before the pair took to the winners' podium.

Tana is quite the keen runner having beaten her hubby in the 2012 london Marathon too - by 15 minutes no less.
Just keep running Gordon, it appears it was a great effort all round today.

A Motherwell-based specialist bakery has secured a supply deal with Waitrose for a range of gluten-free products.
The Just: Gluten Free bakery, based at Motherwell Foodpark, will supply the six existing Scottish Waitrose stores – two in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newton Mearns, Stirling and Helensburgh – with a range of six products comprising gluten-free rolls and sandwich bread.
The company will also supply Waitrose Milngavie when it opens on June 11.
Chloe Graves, Free-From Buyer at Waitrose, said: “Just: Gluten Free is a truly unique product.
“They don’t handle gluten, dairy, nuts or any of the main allergens, so their breads will appeal to customers with multiple allergies.
“This award-winning bakery is a very welcome addition to our family of Scottish suppliers and I’m sure our customers will be very excited by the arrival of these new products in our branches.
Ronnie Stebbings, who has 20 years' experience in the bakery industry, set up The Just: Gluten Free bakery 18 months ago amid his own frustration at the lack of choice and quality in gluten-free products.
Stebbings said: “I wanted to develop better quality gluten free foods because of my own intolerance to wheat.
“When I found out that one in five people are allergic to one of the 14 main food allergens, I decided to create bread that they could all enjoy.
“It was a challenge to say the least; but I firmly believe everyone has the right to a decent sandwich.
“Our bread is high-quality, preservative free and low in fat, salt and sugar.
“We use different blends of all natural tapioca, rice and maize to make our bread and we keep the site allergen free too.
“We contacted Waitrose because it has the same commitment to excellent, tasty food that we do and is well-known for its ‘Love Life’ Free From range.”
The Just: Gluten Free bakery also supplies Ken &amp; Co, McGhee's Family Bakers and Whole Foods Market.

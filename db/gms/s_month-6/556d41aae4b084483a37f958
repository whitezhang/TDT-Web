A BRAVE 6-year-old who lost a kidney to cancer has won a medal for courage at a special party for youngsters diagnosed with the disease.Amy Reid, 6, from Coatbridge was treated to a unique experience at the 'stars and space' themed Cancer Research UK Kids and Teens star awards party.She attended with her mum Laura, 36, dad Robert, 39, and 16-year-old brother, Gary.The party was held in partnership with TK Maxx and took place at The Roof Gardens in London at the weekend.Amy was among 20 children from across the UK who were chosen as special ambassadors to represent the 620 youngsters who received a star award in 2014/15.The 6-year-old became ill in September 2012 just hours after her parents wedding at St James' Chapel, Coatbridge, where she was a flower girl.Amy's mum Laura recalls vividly how in the space of 24 tears joy on one of the happiest days of her life transformed into despair.The whole family were set to get off on holiday to Spain after the wedding reception.Instead, Amy's conditions deteriorated and scans showed a tumour on her left Kidney which was stopping it from working properly.Amy was diagnosed with a Wilms tumour, a rare and aggressive cancer, and endured a six hour operation to remove the kidney.Laura said: &quot;As I took Amy down to the operating theatre I was trying to stop myself crying to keep Amy calm so she would be okay.&quot;I knew she was getting the best care possible but seeing your child like that is so difficult. You feel so vulnerable.&quot;If I could have taken Amy's place then I would have. I paced around outside until she came out of surgery and I knew she was fine.&quot;Now she tells everyone that the scar where they took her kidney out is a big snake.&quot;Amy started chemotherapy but tests revealed a second tumour on her lung and the schoolgirl had to endure another operation.This was followed by a year of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which meant Amy losing her hair and becoming a regular at the Schiehallion ward at Yorkhill.In October 2013, doctors explained that Amy's best chance of survival was a stem cell transplant and this meant two weeks in an isolation ward to reduce the risk of infectionLaura said: &quot;You're looking at the same four walls in hospital all the time which wasn't good at all.&quot;Amy was very quiet when she was in hospital and it was a tough time but she did really well.&quot;By Christmas we got the best present of all. Amy was clear of cancer and she still is in remission.&quot;Amy was now well enough to return to school and only revisit the hospital every three months for a check up.She is now a primary two pupil at St Timothy's Primary School and is loving life.Amy loves karate, swimming and can't wait for the new arrival to the family as her mum Laura is expecting a baby in September.The schoolgirl enjoyed an afternoon of galactic-inspired games including experiments with dry ice, slime making, rocket launching and sampling freeze-dried astronaut ice-cream.She met a line up of celebrities including Good Morning Britain presenter Charlotte Hawkins, X Factor stars Only the Young, former Pussycat Doll Kimberly Wyatt and TV presenter Matt Johnson before receiving her Kids &amp; Teens star awards medal during a presentation ceremony.The Star awards are part of Cancer Research UK's Kids &amp; Teens fundraising campaign, which aims to increase research to find kinder treatments and cures for children, teens and young adults with cancer.

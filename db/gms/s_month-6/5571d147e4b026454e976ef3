A KINDHEARTED student who befriended a homeless man has raised more than &pound;4000 to get him a flat where he can recover from open heart surgery.
Anna Loudon spotted Les Gordon sitting outside a coffee shop in Dundee four months ago after finishing her work and soon decided to buy him a drink.
She discovered that he had been on the streets for at least nine months after breaking his back in a car accident and being left unable to work.
During that time, he endured the bone-chilling weather while being spat on, shouted at and even urinated on by passers-by.
Heartbreakingly, he has had to delay getting open heart surgery as he has nowhere safe to recover.
Anna, a Dundee University student, decided to start a fundraising page to help get him back on his feet.
 

She said: “Despite being in such a difficult situation, Les always stays positive. He’s an avid reader, he loves fishing. He’s also generous despite having so little.
“He is a native Dundonian who has become homeless through a series of unfortunate events.
“He has been on the streets for at least nine months and has endured harsh temperatures while sleeping rough. Unfortunately he has slipped through the cracks of the system.
“Recently he told me that he had to receive open heart surgery and will be putting it off until he can find a place to stay.
“Les and I drink coffee together in the morning and I feel that reaching out to the community might help him finally earn enough money to get a deposit for a flat and at least a couple of months' rent so that he can finally have a roof over his head.
“Money that we raise for Les will go to a deposit on a flat, rent, utilities and any other expenses related to his living conditions.”
A picture of Anna having coffee with Les went viral after another student posted it on Twitter before being picked up by Buzzfeed.
Donations on the GoFundMe page have poured in overnight, smashing Anna’s initial target and raising more than &pound;4500.

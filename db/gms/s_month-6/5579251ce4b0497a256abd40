WORK begins on Saturday on the Glasgow to Edinburgh rail line resulting in no direct trains between the cities from Queen Street high level platforms.Instead commuters will have to take trains from either Queen Street low level or from Central Station.Scotrail is urging passengers to check their journey before the major engineering work begins.The closure of the Winchburgh Tunnel near Linlithgow will affect services from Saturday until Monday July 27.Engineers will be working round the clock to lower and relay two lines of track through the 33om long tunnel and install equipment to carry overhead power lines needed for the electrification of the railway.The work is part of the Scottish Government-funded, &pound;742m Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP) which will electrify the Queen Street line by 2016 - allowing the introduction of faster, greener and longer electric services on the route.Customers who normally travel on this route will have a temporary timetable. As a result of the changes, trains on other routes between both Glasgow Central and Queen Street to Edinburgh will be much busier than usual, particularly at peak times.Extra staff will be at stations to assist passengers and queuing systems will be in place at Glasgow Queen Street, Edinburgh Waverley, Haymarket, Edinburgh Park and Linlithgow stations.ScotRail is advising commuters to set off earlier than normal, as most journeys will take longer and to consider amending their travel times to use trains which are less busy. Customers should plan ahead and visit www.scotrail.co.uk/winchburgh to help them do so.Customers travelling 'end to end' from Glasgow to Edinburgh will be directed by staff at Glasgow Queen Street low level to trains to Edinburgh via Airdrie/Bathgate or at Glasgow Central via Motherwell/Shotts.Trains will run every 30 minutes in both directions between Glasgow Queen Street High Level and Linlithgow only - calling at Croy, Polmont and Falkirk High.Additional weekend works will also take place before and during the 'core' tunnel closure period. Customers are being advised to check the ScotRail website before travelling for amended timings and up-to-date travel information.Phil Verster, ScotRail Alliance's managing director, said: &quot;This is a massive piece of work that will help deliver long lasting benefits to our customers. &quot;Electrifying the line between our two biggest cities will allow us to run faster, longer and greener trains that will cut journey times and increase the number of seats available on this key route.&quot;To make all of this happen, we need to improve the line and install the equipment that we will need to run these new and improved trains, which will cause unavoidable disruption.&quot;This work is a vital part of transforming our railway, and the benefits will be felt for generations to come.&quot;

SOME OF Scotland’s brightest young stars are gathering in Glasgow this weekend for a special charity gig supporting sick children.
Britain’s Got Talent winner Jai McDowall tops the bill at the Let it Shine concert for Yorkhill Children’s Charity taking place at the O2 ABC on Friday.
He will be joined by an eclectic mix of young singing talent, including Emily Middlemass, Stephen McLaughlin, Nicola Cassells and young up and comer Robbi McFaulds.
Robbi, from Airdrie, has been making a stir on social media with a series of gigs, performances and videos, and the 17-year-old singer songwriter said he is delighted to get the chance to play in the Yorkhill event this weekend.
Robbi supported X-Factor stars Stereo Kicks on a recent tour, and has also just released his first single, The Morning After, on iTunes, and said he is working hard to get a big break.
 

He added: “I’m really looking forward to the Yorkhill gig. It’s a great honour to play with so many great singers and its going to be a great night for such a great cause as Yorkhill.
“It’s nice to be able to do something for such a good charity.”
“I’ve always loved playing music and singing for people. I’m working as hard as I can to get my music out there, and I’m always grateful for the chance to play in such amazing concerts.”
 The Yorkhill charity gig Let it Shine starts 7pm, O2 ABC in Glasgow.

AN EMPTY shop on Argyle Street has been let after nearly two years in what estate agents described as "the biggest deal" seen this year.The former Gap site has been let to JD Sports and will become one of the largest shops in the chain's portfolio when it opens later this summer.The two storey building, which measures 23,500 sq feet, has been standing empty since Gap moved to Buchanan Street in September 2013.John Duffy, director of in-town retail with property agent Colliers International in Scotland, said: &quot;This is probably the biggest deal in terms of retail leasing we've seen this year.&quot;Given that there are a number of vacancies on Argyle Street, finally getting a suitable retailer into this very large store is excellent news for the shopping area in general.&quot;Warren Thompson, of JD Sports Fashion added: &quot;We have been pleased with the advice and market knowledge provided by Colliers International over recent years which has enabled us to secure this prime site in Glasgow.&quot;

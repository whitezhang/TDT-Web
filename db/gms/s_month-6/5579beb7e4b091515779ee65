TV presenter Melinda Messenger is on the hunt for the best landscaping job in Glasgow for a nationwide competition.
Competing for the prize of being the best - and a weekend for two in London in September - entries will be judged by a panel of experts.
The contest is organised by timber and builders merchants Travis Perkins and is only open to their account holders.
Melinda said: “Over the years, I’ve had brilliant experiences of tradesmen working with me. Yet there are so many cowboy tradesmen out there. I’m working with Travis Perkins on the High 5 project to find the people who are getting it right and show everyone just how valuable the landscape gardener is.
“A good landscape gardener can transform even the smallest space into something interesting. Someone who can utilise the space imaginatively and really listen to what their client needs, is what we’re looking for.
“We’re looking for examples of great landscaping work. It could be the creation of an all-weather seating area, structure added to a bland landscape, a lawn that gives Hampden Park a run for its money or simply a driveway packed with personality using inventive paving.
“I’ll be looking for innovation, creativity and imagination from the entries - a space that I’d want to go into. In addition, there will have to be a mix of textures and materials that work well together, it should be a low maintenance garden, but done brilliantly.&quot;
 Nominations must come from a client by August 17, either by giving them a nomination card or by submitting online at www.travisperkins.co.uk/competitions

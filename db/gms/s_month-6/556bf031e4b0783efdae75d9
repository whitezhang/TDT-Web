PEOPLE with mental health conditions are dying younger, being denied opportunities in work and experiencing discrimination socially.Scotland's mental health community will come together in Glasgow tomorrow (TUE) for a landmark conference to discuss these issues and ensure that they lead in defining what the future of mental health looks like.The Rights for Life event, from See Me, the Scottish Recovery Network [SRN] and Voices of eXperience [VOX], wants to mobilise the mental health community to help them gain greater access to their rights.According to the organisers, the event, which will see more than 60 speakers from all over the world joined by hundreds of people, has come at a vital time, with the newly elected Conservative Government considering replacing the Human Rights Act and with mental health being higher up the political agenda than ever before.Statistics from the Royal College of Psychiatrists show that on average people with mental health problems die five -ten years younger than the general population.A recent survey from See Me has found that 48% of Scottish workers think that someone in their work would be unlikely to disclose a mental health problem for fear of losing their job.Meanwhile, the Scottish Social Attitudes survey also found that the amount of people who think that those with mental health problems should have the same human rights as anyone else is dropping, from 88% in 2002, to 82% last year.Simon Bradstreet, director of SRN, said: &quot;We want to mobilise people to help improve the lives of those who are already struggling financially and socially, who now find their rights are also under attack.&quot;We know that people experiencing mental health issues are significantly disadvantaged in our society and we firmly believe helping people to realise the rights they already have, and to challenge injustices, will help make recovery more possible.&quot;The conference will have a focus on how people can continue to have an adequate standard of living during austerity, with benefits and vital community services being cut.Judith Robertson, See Me programme director, said: &quot;We want to give voice to people with direct experience of mental health problems to define what the future of mental health looks like.&quot;This is important. Rights that allow people with mental health conditions to live fulfilled lives, such as the right to adequate health care or the right to an adequate standard of living, can be ignored, which is discriminatory and can impact on their recovery.&quot;Dr Heather Stuart, the Bell Canada Mental Health and Anti-Stigma Research Chair, who is the keynote speaker at the conference, said: &quot;The stigma that surrounds mental illnesses robs individuals of their civic and human rights, things that the rest of us take for granted such as a friend, a safe and secure home, and a job.&quot;Stigma is more long lasting and life limiting than the illness itself and it undermines every aspect of the therapeutic encounter and is a barrier to recovery.&quot;The Canadian Opening Minds programme has developed a number of evidence based approaches to stigma intervention that may be more broadly useful as Scotland moves ahead with its anti-stigma initiatives.&quot;Rights that affect people in education, work and in the health care system will also be discussed at the event.

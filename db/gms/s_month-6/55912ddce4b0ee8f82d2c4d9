Festival goers urged to 'keep safe'POLICE Scotland launched its ‘keep safe’ campaign aimed at festival goers today at Buchanan Bus Station.The initiative is led by Detective Inspector Michael Miller, National Drug Co-Ordinator from Police Scotland’s Safer Communities team.He said: “Tens of thousands of people are getting ready for the summer festivals. We want people to have a fantastic time and our focus is on keeping them safe when they get there.”Officers will highlight a range of issues for festival goers through posters and social media including personal safety tips, crime prevention advice as well as the risks from alcohol and drug use.DI Miller added: “Enjoy your festival experience and don’t ruin it by being found in possession of drugs. You will be arrested and prosecuted.“This also applies to New Psychoactive Substances or NPS, often misleadingly referred to as ‘legal highs’ – there is no safe way to take them and the short and long term consequences of taking these potentially dangerous chemicals is not yet known.”Hundreds of music fans will travel to festivals from Buchan Bus Station.Fiona Kerr, Managing Director of bus firm First Glasgow, said: “We fully support Police Scotland's efforts to encourage everyone attending the festival to 'keep safe' when at the event.“We'd encourage those travelling to plan their journey in advance, leave in enough time whether heading there or heading home and follow the personal safety tips that are provided.&quot;SPT Chief Executive Gordon Maclennan added: “Revellers have been travelling from Buchanan Bus Station to festival sites for many years now and SPT staff are always on hand to ensure that their health and safety is protected from the very outset of their experience.“We’re pleased that Police Scotland are launching the ‘keep safe’ campaign and hope that festival goers remember to take care while enjoying themselves.”

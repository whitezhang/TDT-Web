A FIVE year old boy from Lerwick who sparked a major search on Saturday evening has been found safe and well after accidentally being locked in the back of a van.
Bradley Simpson was last seen at 4pm playing on his bicycle outside his home in Norstane, Lerwick.
He was due to spend the night at his grandmother’s house across the road, but when he failed to turn up by 8pm she phoned her daughter, Bradley’s mother Leona Simpson, who called the police.
 The police and the coastguard sent out search parties and friends and neighbours joined the hunt as word spread like wildfire across Shetland via social media. 
Then shortly after 10pm word came that the boy had been found locked in the back of a van.
Shortly after he was found his mother Leona told local paper Shetland News: “He climbed into the back of a van and got locked in. He probably made a nest for himself and went to sleep.
“This is a massive relief.”
 She thanked everyone in Shetland, posting on Facebook : “Thank you everyone who sent messages and helped look for Bradley thank you soo much. True kindness xxx.” 
She said Bradley was fine and well and the whole family were delighted to have him safe at home, where he was getting ready to go to bed after his adventure.
 Police Scotland added their thanks to all the members of the public for their assistance in finding the young boy.

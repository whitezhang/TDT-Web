A key witness to the murder of gangster Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll was banned from entering America.
Stephen McLaggan, 28, had been looking forward to a week in Las Vegas.
But he was turned away minutes after his plane touched down last Monday.
McLaggan fled from the car seconds before Carroll was gunned down in &shy;January 2010.
He was with the drug baron at a secret &shy;summit with another dealer at an Asda car park in &shy;Glasgow’s Robroyston.
 

Car trader McLaggan was due to attend the North American&shy; &shy;Federations of Celtic Supporters Clubs’ annual convention. But friends warned he risked being refused entry when he announced the holiday on Facebook.
One wrote: “You’re &shy;getting patted on the back and sent home as soon as you land.”
 

McLaggan, of Glasgow’s Balornock, was sent back to the UK on the next &shy;available flight.
Last night, McLaggan was &shy;unavailable for comment. But his dad Stephen said: “He’s said, ‘F*** the Yanks’.”

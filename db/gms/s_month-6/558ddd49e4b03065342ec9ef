MHAIRI Black, the SNP MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, has tweeted a graduation photo after obtaining her degree from the University of Glasgow.
Ms Black, who stood for election against Douglas Alexander in the general election and defeated the Labour stalwart by 23,548 votes to 17,864, graduated with a first class honours degree in politics. 
The youngest MP for over 300 years, Ms Black’s final exam was on Scottish politics, and she attended a graduation ceremony with her classmates at the historic university on Friday afternoon.
She tweeted a photo of herself with the degree, saying: “Overwhelmed by all the messages of support. They’re really appreciated. It’s been a great day for everyone involved.”
Ms Black had said earlier that she was ‘really proud’ to have secured the degree.
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: “We would like to congratulate Mhairi Black, as we would all of our students who are graduating this summer.
“They have all worked extremely hard to earn their degrees and we wish them the very best for their future careers.”

Cheeky JK Rowling tries to dodge library finesSHE might be one of the world's highest-profile authors - and a multi-millionaire - but that hasn't stopped JK Rowling asking to dodge library fines. Orkney Library, named Library of the Year at the Bookseller Industry Awards, tweeted the Harry Potter author to give her a gentle ticking off. &quot;Dear @jk_rowling,&quot; they wrote, &quot;You don't seem to follow any libraries. If you wish to rectify this error you may like to start with Library of the Year&quot;. Entering into the spirit of the thing, Rowling sent a cheeky tweet in reply: &quot;@OrkneyLibrary If I follow you, will you let me off fines when I return books late?&quot; The library, it turns out, doesn't fine any of its borrowers - but has a different punishment in store for errant readers: &quot;@jk_rowling We don't operate a fine system. How good are we? We do an excellent line in disapproving looks though...&quot; The final word was left to Rowling: &quot;@OrkneyLibrary Hmm. OK, I'll risk it.&quot; Orkney Library, with more than 18,000 followers, has become a Twitter favourite with its quirky mix of library news and nonsense. One of its most popular tweets featured a picture of a well-kent heavy metal band with the words: &quot;Don't forget - it's National Visit The Library Dressed As A Member Of Whitesnake Day tomorrow.&quot;The library is now trying to persuade its newest follower to pay a visit.

 Mad Props Theatre , the group behind The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee (***** Daily Record), Avenue Q and The Last Five Years are back with another Glasgow premiere, Jason Robert Brown’s Parade. 
With auditions taking place from the 19th June, the group are searching for a racially diverse ensemble, with a vast age range.
First premiering on Broadway in 1998, Alfred Uhry’s Tony Award-winning Parade dramatises the racially charged 1913 Atlanta trial of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory manager wrongly accused of brutally raping and murdering a 13-year-old worker under his charge.
As the press whipped the public into an outraged frenzy, Leo’s only hope lay in a brave crusade for justice led by the Southern wife he never understood.
The show has never been staged in Glasgow before, but producer Louise Creechan is confident that audiences will fall in love with it.
She said: “It’s a musical like no other - but sadly is underproduced and slightly unknown - we guarantee that if you listen to the soundtrack, you’ll fall in love with the beautiful music and poignant story.
“The parts are like no other - there’s something for everyone to do, to really become their real life character.
“Jim Conley, the African-American janitor who is very much at the centre of the story needs to have a fantastic voice and to also show a manipulative side.
“And then, on the other hand, Lucille - Leo’s wife - needs to push the story along and pull at the heartstrings of the audience as she stands by her husband.”
The transformational story is part murder mystery and part social commentary about a country whose behaviour is often at odds with its declarations of equality, brought to vivid life with a soaring score from Jason Robert Brown, who was behind this year’s smash hit film The Last Five Years starring Anna Kendrick.

A COMMUNITY radio station in Govan is to hold a food collection event during the annual Govan Fair to tackle the food shortages faced by Glasgow SW Food Bank.The Govan food bank issued an emergency appeal because they were having to turn people away through lack of supplies.John Beattie, of Sunny Govan Radio, who is setting up a stall outside the local Jobcentre this weekend during the Govan Fair, will be joined by residents and members of the public.Mr Beattie, also a Phd student in social science at the University of the West of Scotland, said: &quot;The situation for the food bank in the last couple of months has been worsening and is fast developing into a crisis.&quot;They are constantly struggling to meet demand and emergency appeals are becoming more regular. We feel this is unacceptable.&quot;Govan is a community where people often struggle to make ends meet and, for its people to donate food in the volumes they have done so, it shows that community spirit is alive and well - and we hope to harness this and keep developing it.&quot;Mr Beattie says raising awareness of the number of people who need to attend foodbanks is also part of the group's aim at the Fair at the weekend.He added: &quot;People having to depend on food banks to survive is drastically increasing, and has been doing so since 2010 when the Conservative and Liberal coalition came to power.&quot;At our collections, we have lots of stats and figures on food bank usage pinned up across the walls for people to see the reality of the situation.&quot;This often leads to people wanting to engage in conversation to find out more about the problem.Alex Johnstone, Scottish Conservative welfare spokesman, said: &quot;It's shocking that some Scots have to rely on food banks.&quot;The UK government has tried to alleviate the situation by taking some of the lowest paid out of income tax altogether and introducing Universal Credit to ensure that it always pays to work. This has made millions of Scots better off.&quot;In fact, our welfare reform measures have actually worked in reducing poverty by getting people off benefits and back to work. We've stood up to the challenge of welfare reform to get the country back on its feet.&quot;He added: &quot;We do realise that there will be certain circumstances when people need help from the state. That's why we have a system in place, to help people when they most need it.&quot;As well as collecting food, the group of volunteers led by Mr Beattie are hoping to secure as many signatures as possiblefor a petition calling for the Scottish Government to use their &pound;145million underspend on helping foodbanks across Scotland.In response to Mr Beattie's call, a Scottish Gvernemnt spokeswoman said: &quot;The Government is doing everything possible with the resources and powers it has to tackle inequalities and food poverty at a time of cuts from Westminster.&quot;We are investing around &pound;296million from 2013-14 to 2015-16 in anti-poverty measures, including our &pound;1 million Emergency Food Action Plan which helps 26 emergency food projects provide food aid and funds FareShare to redistribute food from retailers to community organisations.&quot;The reality of the underspend is that this money rolls forward into next year and we plan to fully spend it on our programme, including tackling inequalities and creating jobs.&quot;The Glasgow SW Food Bank in Govan has praised Mr Beattie, Kevin McGee and everyone involved with Sunny Govan Radio for their help.Speaking to the Evening Times about the importance of getting food to those who need it, Claire McCunnie, of Glasgow SW Food Bank, said: &quot;We don't just help people on benefits being sanctioned, we are helping families where two parents work but, once the bills are paid, they can't afford to feed themselves.&quot;It's heartbreaking to hear some stories from our service users and i am just happy we are here to help them out of whatever their crisis may be.This weekend marks the 259th Govan Fair, which will run from 12pm on Friday afternoon through to 10pm June 7.

WHO says collaborations don't work?
 Sparks and Franz Ferdinand made their live debut as FFS last night at Glasgow's School of Art. 
Franz band members Alex Kapranos, Paul Thomson, Nick McCarthy and Bob Hardy were joined by Sparks duo Ron and Russell Mael for the FFS collaboration that kicked off with Police Encounters from their self-titled and newly released debut album.
Following quickly with another of the album tracks Johnny Delusional they proved themselves with the perfect mash-up.
And all the members were clearly enjoying themselves, with the exception of stony-faced Ron on keyboards, as they performed the ruggedly handsome and upbeat The Man Without A Tan complete with Kapranos high kicks.
&quot;So how's Glasgow tonight,&quot; Alex asked. The answer, &quot;Russell, we love you.&quot;
Comprising mainly songs from the FFS album that made a good impression such as The Power Couple and Call Girl, songs by both bands also got a look in beginning with Franz Ferdinand's Do You Want To and Take Me Out and later Sparks classic This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us proving those who had managed to get gold-dust tickets for the intimate gig were, 'oh, so lucky'.
It may have taken more than a decade to pull off the collaboration between the little guys from the suburbs and Californian pop legends.
But it worked, even the execution of songs about existentialism and John Paul Sartre.
Collaborations Definitely Do Work!

A FORMER constable claims he was told by two fellow police officers to lie about potential evidence during the Emma Caldwell murder case.
 Aksoy Ozer worked as a translator in the unsolved inquiry, even though his grasp of the language was “very limited”. 
Four Turkish men were arrested over Emma’s 2005 murder. But the case against them collapsed.
Former constable Ozer believes a computer programme he used to turn recorded Turkish conversations into English may have provided inaccurate translations.
But when he offered to go back over the transcripts using new equipment to correct inaccuracies, he was told not to.
Ozer said he was told by the colleague: “If this came out in a trial then we would be questioned as to why we never listened to all the discs using the new equipment’.”
The ex-officer claims: “I was extremely concerned regarding this as I had just been told to lie in court.”
Ozer raised the misconduct allegations to the then Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini in 2008 and lodged two grievances with the police. But no action was taken.
Highlands MSP John Finnie said: &quot;An urgent inquiry should be carried out into Ozer’s claims.&quot;
He added: “These matters constitute a potential attempt to pervert the course of justice.”
Emma, 27, was found dead near Biggar, Lanarkshire. Despite a &pound;4million inquiry, her killer has never been brought to justice.
Ozer’s claims compound other doubts over the murder investigation.
 In April, our sister paper the Sunday Mail revealed a forgotten suspect . Iain Packer, of Airdrie, is a former client of Emma, who had become a prostitute after developing a drug addiction. He was interviewed six times over the murder but never arrested. 
Advocate Frank Mulholland has recently ordered a fresh inquiry into Emma’s killing.

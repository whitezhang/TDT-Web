 Boxing, netball, lawn bowls, triathlon and snowsports are to receive big increases in funding from the Scottish Government over the next four years. 
 From the &pound;45.2m investment for the 2015-19 cycle, areas &quot;demonstrating membership growth and attaining performance targets&quot; are rewarded. 
 The record expenditure is up &pound;3m from the 2011-15 period. 
 The new phase covers the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in 2018. 
 &quot;This record investment in Scottish sport's governing bodies will benefit all participants - our clubs, volunteers, performance athletes, and coaches,&quot; said Scotland's Minister for Sport Jamie Hepburn. 
 &quot;It will help us to continue to increase capacity in sport, building on the hugely successful and inspirational 2014 Commonwealth Games. 
 &quot;The positive impact of hosting the Commonwealth Games has been felt right across the sporting spectrum, boosted by other high-profile events like the Ryder Cup and the Davis Cup.&quot; 
 Olympic and Paralympic sports are midway through their investment 2013-17 cycle, so the funds do not impact on preparations for Rio 2016. 
 Judo, a huge success for Scotland at the 2014 Glasgow Games, has been dropped for the Gold Coast event, with basketball taking its place in Australia. 
 However, judo will receive a 3.17% funding increase, while Basketball Scotland is currently mid-cycle, so there is no new money being announced. 
 Aquatics once again leads the way with more than &pound;5m, although the figure is marginally down by 0.62%. 
 Spending on athletics is down by 2.08% to &pound;3.76m, with cycling, hockey, rugby and gymnastics also receiving more than &pound;3m. 
 The boxing budget leaps up by almost 45% to just over &pound;2.5m, with netball getting &pound;2.07m (up 35%). 
 Scotland's lawn bowlers won three gold medals and one silver at Glasgow 2014, with funding rising by almost 30% to &pound;1.84m. 
 Curling continues to receive healthy support, with &pound;2.87m (up 1.66%), with snowsports getting a 41.34% boost to &pound;1.85m.

GLASGOW seafood specialist Gamba has fought off stiff competition to make the final shortlist for the Restaurant of the Year competition.The inaugural event, organised by The Caterer and Seafish UK, unveiled the lucky contenders following a judging session in central London last week.As part of the latest round of judging, the five restaurants, which pride themselves on their use and knowledge of fish and shellfish, were chosen from a longer list of 10 selected restaurants.They were visited by a mystery judge, a Seafish-appointed auditor, last month.Gamba is the only Scottish eatery in the shortlist.It joins Outlaw's at the Capital in London, the Jetty in Christchurch, Rocksalt in Folkestone and Hix Oyster and Fish House in Lyme Regis.The final five shortlisted restaurants will be invited to attend an awards ceremony in London on June 24 at the Michelin starred Benares Restaurant, home of judge Atul Kochhar.The winner will receive a bespoke trophy for their restaurant and a seafood masterclass course at Billingsgate Seafood Training School.There will also be a range of other prizes, including vouchers to be redeemed against cookery equipment and signed copies of cookery books.

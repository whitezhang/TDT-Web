BOOTS is set to cut 700 jobs across the UK. 
The pharmacy giant has said half of the total posts will go will be at its Nottingham base with the rest spread around the UK.
The company has said the losses will be achieved through “redundancy, retraining and redeployment”.
Simon Roberts, Boots President said: “Together with my leadership team, I believe this plan will make Boots even better for our customers and drive sustainable future growth.
“We also remain fully committed to our presence in Nottingham, which has been the home of Boots since the very beginning.”
Boots employs 60,000 people in the UK and Roberts did not say whether there would be further rounds of job cuts.
Talks are due to begin with affected members of staff this week.
The company claims they are restructuring to provide a better standard of service for customers and to ensure future growth and that they are “committed” to their presence in Nottingham.
The cuts come after US retailer Walgreens took full control of Boots owner Alliance Boots after announcing a &pound;9billion takeover.
The new group, Walgreen Boots Alliance, will be based in Chicago but the headquarters of Boots will remain in Nottingham.
Boots has nearly 2,500 stores in the UK.

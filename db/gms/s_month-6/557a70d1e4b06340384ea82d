PUPILS from Anderston Primary School have a lot to shout about.They are delighted to have been given a say in the planning of a new mural in the area that shows their pride in the community.Children from local primary and nursery schools, youth and senior citizens groups, were all involved in a project set up by third year architecture students from Glasgow School of Art.The idea behind the &quot;35-hour project&quot; first set up last year is to help students bridge the gap between study and working in practice: they have a budget to spend - in this case &pound;10,000 kindly donated by Sanctuary Scotland Housing Association to produce a piece of public art - as well as clients to work with and a real piece of architecture to plan as build as opposed to a class assignment that never leaves the drawing board.&quot;The students came to our school we had a lot of fun,&quot; says 12-year-old Halkwat Sultan, a P7 pupil from Anderston Primary School. &quot;They listened to our plans and we designed our own ideas.&quot;We starting drawing on paper what we thought would be a good mural, then we had to bring something to school that reminded us of home because the mural will remind us of our homes in Anderston.&quot;I brought in the first USB of our new home, it's full of pictures we took in our new home a couple of years ago. That's what is important to me.&quot;For 11-year-old classmate Disha Yadav, the workshops were a good opportunity to find out more about the local area.&quot;I think it is important that we have an input in the design of the mural as we are going to be here and see it every day. It was great that we were asked for our opinions and that they matter,&quot; she says.&quot;I am looking forward to seeing it when it goes up on the wall later in the year.&quot;The site of the mural is on the square between William Street and St Vincent Street, on the border between Sanctuary Scotland Housing Association and Glasgow West Housing Association in the redeveloped area. It is actually the land where the old community laundry, or steamie, sat when the streets were filled with tenements.This is latest piece of public art funded by Sanctuary Scotland Housing Association. In 2011 it commissioned Andy Scott, the artist behind the Kelpies, to create a giant mural of Billy Connolly which can be seen in phase one of the housing provider's &pound;50m regeneration of Anderston's housing stock.A group of eight architecture students have been involved in the mural project since the start of the year.&quot;We really had to throw ourselves at it completely, you have to see everything through,&quot; explains 20-year-old student Jennifer Taggart.&quot;For the community I think this is something everyone has in common now; it has crossed over between the different schools, they all have this involvement in it. Everyone has taken a real interest in the project and most people we have spoken to have been really excited and wanted to put their opinion across.&quot;The primary schools were great because they don't hold back on what they say and they gave us all sorts of ideas. They were so enthusiastic and had really great ideas.&quot;Once the mural gets planning permission, it should be in place later in the year. Jennifer described the final design as something more three-dimensional than traditional murals, a tactile piece of wall art for everyone in the community to feel a connection with.&quot;We found everyone was very proud of the area and whenever they speak of Anderston there is pride in their voice,&quot; says fellow student Quyen Phan. &quot;There's something in the name and we have to get that in the mural.&quot;We are thinking of having the word Anderston in a frame and infilling it with different materials. That could be concrete as a nod to the tower blocks that are being knocked down, metal for shipbuilding, ceramics because there used to be a ceramics factory here that we discovered in our research, glass and also the Botanic Gardens were based here originally - so that could be represented too.&quot;The project has been a real change from drawing in a studio to actually engaging with people who live in the local community, says GSA lecturer Nick Walker who is also an architect with Collective Architecture.&quot;Sometimes when you're doing your own work it can be very self involved but when you've got to produce work for someone else it can be much less critical and you just get on with it,&quot; he comments.&quot;Our students have found out how to work in teams, how to prioritise particular parts of a process and the big buzzword is inter-disciplinary working - finding out how to work with others.&quot;If you're a really good designer but can't speak to other people you're not going to get anywhere. It's really about how you get on with other people.&quot;See the Anderston mural project alongside work by more than 600 graduating students at The Glasgow School of Art Degree Show from Saturday to June 20. The Anderston project will also be featured in The Mac exhibition in Oxo Tower as part of The London Festival of Architecture from June 25 - 28.

FORMER MSP Tommy Sheridan has blasted sectarian thugs who attacked his home and left his young daughter terrified.
The socialist firebrand told how four yobs pelted the windows of his home with eggs while calling him a “fenian b******”.
The incident happened at his house on the south side of Glasgow on Monday night while his wife Gail and 10-year-old daughter Gabrielle were at home.
Mr Sheridan, 51, tweeted: “Wee b******s. Just had house windows egged by 4 thugs shouting “Sheridan ya fenian b******”. Wee Gabrielle is very upset #A******** #Cowards.”
The former Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) leader was bombarded with messages from his followers offering their support.
Phil Corbett said: “Don’t let these bigoted muppets get you down Tommy, their type are a blight on Scotland.
Ileene Mac posted: “So sorry to read this Tommy. What a shame. I know how I’d feel if it was my kids. Hugs to you all, especially wee Gabrielle.”
His sister Lynn Sheridan added: “I hope you are all safe and have called the police.”
Mr Sheridan later thanked his followers for their support.
He said: “Thanks 4 the warm messages of support regarding the house windows being egged. Wee Gabrielle is ok now. She was frightened #OnlyEggs #HeadUp.”
Last month, Mr Sheridan’s wife Gail welcomed a watchdog’s ruling that police should apologise to her for the way she was treated during an interview.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner her after she raised complaints against officers in 2011.
The ruling means Police Scotland will have to reinvestigate complaints surrounding her treatment, when she claims she was asked about her religion and to remove her rosary beads.
Singer Susan Boyle revealed earlier this week that she has been targeted by an unknown man bombarding her with sectarian abuse and threats over the phone.

 Glasgow City have gained direct entry to the knock-out rounds of the 2015-16 Women's Champions League after being seeded eighth in the tournament. 
 City have previously entered in the qualifying round but will instead begin their campaign in the round of 32. 
 This season's eight qualifying groups take place from 11-16 August and the draw for the last 32 will be made on 20 August. 
 Glasgow reached the quarter-finals of last season's competition. 
 &quot;We are delighted to finally be out of the qualification group stages,&quot; said club manager Laura Montgomery. 
 &quot;Back in 2008 when we first made it out of qualification by winning our group, we were the lowest ranked team, but our repeated progress to the knock-out rounds has moved us in recent years to the highest ranking team in the qualification stage. 
 &quot;Our current overall country position of 12th also means that if we can hold this place, we will have two Scottish teams enter the Champions League next season. 
 &quot;Over the years I have been disappointed with the lack of support from other clubs within the game to our Champions League endeavours and I hope that view may now change given our success will hopefully lead to our country getting two teams in the competition in future, provided of course we have a successful campaign this year and hold our position.&quot; 
 Reigning champions City currently lead the Scottish Women's Premier League table, level on points with second-placed Hibernian.

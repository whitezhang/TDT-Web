SCOTLAND goalkeeper Allan McGregor has called off his wedding to Leah Shevlin.
The bombshell news came just ten days before the pair were due to tie the knot at luxury Mount Stuart House in Rothesay next weekend.
However, the former Rangers star reportedly text pals: &quot;Cancel the kilts&quot;.
The Sun newspaper claims the couple, who have a three-year-old daughter Noelle Rose, had a huge argument before flying out to Dubai.

On Thursday Leah deleted all mentions of her famous fianc&eacute; from her Twitter account.
Yesterday she posted a cryptic message which read: &quot;No regrets.. I've been through so much in my life, more than most!
&quot;Every experience good or bad, makes me a stronger person.. No1 can bring me down and nothing can break me, I only become more determined.&quot;

 Only last month Leah Shevlin partied with friends on her hen weekend in London . 
The 32-year-old mum of one travelled by first class train from Hull to London with a posse of her friends for a night on the tiles.
The WAG tweeted a photo of herself on the train sipping a canned cocktail with a rude novelty straw.
 

It’s thought she hired a “party bus” to whisk the group around London, stopping off for more cocktails before heading to a top restaurant.
However, McGregor's mates have now said the Hull star had second thoughts about his wedding and that's why he called it off.

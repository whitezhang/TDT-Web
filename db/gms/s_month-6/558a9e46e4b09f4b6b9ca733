Glasgow is one of the most expensive places to be buriedGLASGOW is the third most expensive place in Scotland to be buried.Citizens Advice Scotland contacted all 32 local councils in the country and asked how much they charge for an internment and lair.East Dunbartonshire came top at a total of &pound;2785, Edinburgh came second at &pound;2162 and Glasgow third at &pound;1980.The cheapest council in Scotland was the Western Isles at only &pound;694.As well as the burial, grieving families will also have to pay the cost of an undertaker and flowers can cost thousands more.CAS spokesman Fraser Sutherland said: “When someone dies you have to pay not just the funeral directors, florists etc, but you also have to pay your local authority for the costs of the internment and the lair.&quot;“We have found again that cremations are a much less expensive form of saying goodbye, with an average charge of &pound;601. However even this is 5% higher than the charges last year and is a difficult amount for many families to find, especially if the bereavement is sudden.“Whether you choose a funeral or a cremation, the additional fees of funeral directors, florists etc. swell these basic costs considerably, but at least people can shop around and make choices about those services. The Local Authority charges are a major problem and need to be addressed urgently.“We have seen a massive increase in the numbers of Scots coming to the CAB because they can’t afford to pay these huge costs.&quot;We have met with Scottish Government Ministers and will continue to work with other campaign groups to highlight these issues and campaign for change.”In the last year, the cost of an internment and grave in Glasgow have increased by 1%.

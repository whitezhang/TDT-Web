A TEENAGE driver killed in a fireball crash on Deeside has been named locally as Jordan Milne.
The 18-year-old was alone in his black MG when it was involved in a smash with a silver Mercedes.
It’s understood the four occupants of the Mercedes were travelling home from a wedding reception.
They were a woman in her 50s, a man in his 70s, a 68-year-old woman and another man in his 60s.
They were all taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but their injuries are not believed to be serious.
Jordan’s vehicle landed on its roof and burst into flames following the collision on Sunday morning.
One local living near the crash scene on the A93 Kincardine O’Neil to Aboyne road said his car turned into “a ball of fire”.
Two Scottish Fire and Rescue crews attended the incident at around 1.10am. The road was closed for eight hours to allow investigators to examine the scene and try to piece together what happened.
A Police Scotland spokesman today said that inquiries are ongoing and the victim had still to be formally identified.
The victim is believed to be from the village of Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire.

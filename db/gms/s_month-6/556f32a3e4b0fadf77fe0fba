A HEARTLESS care home supervisor who called an elderly woman an “evil old bitch” and told her “the quicker you die, the better” has been struck off.
Lynn Sweeney faced a catalogue of charges relating to abuse carried out at Parkhouse Manor Care Home in Barrhead, near Glasgow, between July 2010 and October 2014.
She dumped one patient’s dinner in the bin and told colleagues to tell anyone who asked that he had been fed.
She was also found to have hit another male patient on the forehead with a slipper.
A hearing at the Scottish Social Services Council found Sweeney’s behaviour had placed service users at “unnecessary risk of serious harm” and removed her from the register.

Man hit by plaster fall at B&B in plea over help for homelessA HOMELESS man hit out after claims he was injured when the roof fell in at a Glasgow bed and breakfast.Andrew Greig says he was injured after parts of plaster fell from the ceiling and that he claimed “smashed” onto his head in a room at the Chez Nous B&amp;B in Hillhead Street.Andrew, 44, from Drumchapel, became homeless about two years ago after a relationship breakdown with his former partner.He has since been trying to rebuild his life but has had to rely on the council’s homelessness service to put a roof over his head.Andrew said he was having a cup of tea in a ground floor room in the Chez Nous B&amp;B shortly before 11pm on Thursday night when the incident happened.He said: “I was sitting in the room and I heard a crack. Then the roof just fell down and bits of it smashed me right in the head.“Bits of it fell onto my ankle and the rest of my body. The plaster in that place is really, really thick and there are high ceilings.”Andrew went to hospital and doctors found he had a fractured ankle.He added: “I could have been knocked out. If I was sleeping at the time I might have been knocked out and I’d never wake up.“The doctors gave me strong painkillers. I’m quite traumatised by the whole thing.“There was a big hole in the roof when I left the room.“This just shows the kind of conditions they are putting people like myself in.”Andrew was then given a room in the St Enoch Hotel for the rest of the night.He is now considering taking legal action against the management of Chez Nous.Andrew feared he would not be given accommodation anywhere else following the incident however Glasgow City Council assured the Evening Times that he would be offered shelter.A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: “Mr Greig was offered alternative accommodation and this offer was accepted.“His belongings have been recovered from the room in question and we are pleased the matter has been resolved.”The Evening Times contacted Chez Nous management on several occasions for a comment but they did not return our calls.

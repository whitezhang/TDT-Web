SCOTLAND star Alan Hutton was involved in a fight outside a pub hours after playing in Saturday’s Euro qualifier against Ireland.
The Record understands the Aston Villa defender stepped in to protect his family after they were abused walking past an amateur football club’s awards bash.
 Hutton, 30, flew into Scotland after the 1-1 draw in Dublin to spend time with his two  children, wife Kylie, and her parents. 
But the former Rangers full-back got into bother as he made his way home from a night out at a bowling club in Hurlford, Ayrshire, with Kylie, 28, and mother-in-law Janie, 60.
A source said: “Alan is in Hurlford all the time as Kylie’s family live there.
“Alan, Kylie and Janie have gone down to the bowling club for a couple of drinks after Alan got back on Saturday night. Everything has been fine until they were walking home past the Thistle Bar where Hurlford Amateur FC have been having their Player of the Year night.
 

“A bunch of guys from the amateur team have been standing outside where they go to smoke as Alan and his family have been walking past.
“The group from the Thistle have been pretty drunk and works have been exchanged.
“Alan has stepped in and Kylie and Janie have been shoved around and there has been a bit of an altercation.
 

“When Alan stepped in, one of the guys backed down and that was it. Alan was just doing what anyone would have done and protected his family.
“It’s a shame because he doesn’t usually get any hassle out and about in Hurlford.”
It is believed Janie suffered rib injuries in the incident.
Hutton, originally from Troon, Ayrshire, married Kylie in 2011 at Edinburgh’s St Giles Cathedral and the couple have two children together.

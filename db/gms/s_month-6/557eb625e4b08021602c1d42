The leader of Glasgow City Council Gordon Matheson said he was standing in the contest to be deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party.
The announcement follows the formal resignation of leader Jim Murphy and deputy leader Kezia Dugdale.
The changes at the top of the Scottish party come in the wake of Labour losing all but one of its 41 seats at May's general election.
Mr Matheson said he offered the necessary experience to do the job.
The 48-year-old, who is the first to throw his hat in the ring for the deputy job, became a councillor in May 1999 and was elected leader of Glasgow City Council in May 2010.
In a statement on Monday, Mr Matheson said: &quot;The Scottish Labour Party needs to stop feeling sorry for itself and instead focus on the concerns of the people of Scotland.
&quot;I offer the distinct combination of experience and change. I have successfully led Scotland's largest city for over five years. But because I'm not an MSP I offer a fresh perspective on the national political scene.&quot;
He added that he was &quot;under no illusions as to the challenges&quot; ahead for the Scottish Labour Party but he was &quot;up for the fight&quot; because he believed in Labour values.
The Scottish Labour leadership is being contested by two MSPs, Ms Dugdale and Ken Macintosh.

A TRAGIC schoolboy killed by a falling gravestone was laid to rest today following a touching memorial service.
Family and friends of eight-year-old Ciaran Williamson gathered in Cardonald, Glasgow, for his funeral service after releasing scores of lanterns and balloons into the sky the night before.
Celtic fan Ciaran died last Tuesday after being hit by the 6ft headstone while playing with friends in Craigton Cemetery.
Emergency crews were called to the scene, just behind the flats were he lived, but nothing could be done to save him and he was pronounced dead at Yorkhill Children’s Hospital.
His death certificate revealed he had suffered injuries to his head and neck.

Two 10-year-old boys were also injured in the accident but released from hospital soon after.
Around 100 people gathered to pay their respects as the youngster’s coffin left a funeral parlour near his home before a private burial at St Convel’s Cemetery in Barrhead yesterday.
Ciaran’s mum Stephanie and her partner Thomas were at the service, along with the youngster’s dad, Ryan.
Thomas’ dad, Thomas McGee, wrote on Facebook: “I know he is at rest now and everyone is waiting for him in heaven with open arms.”
Michelle Mccabe added: “Today is the day we lay the wee man to rest. Such a hard time but you will never be forgotten Ciaran. Fly high with the angels little guy. Your one in a million and never forget that.”
After the lanterns were released close to Ciaran’s home on Thursday, Melissa Bowie wrote on Facebook: “They flew right up to get you. There were so many, it was amazing!”

CONSERVATIVE economic policies are "illiterate" and are costing society more in the long term according to a Glasgow MP.Chris Stephens, Glasgow South West SNP MP, made his maiden speech in the House of Commons and said the too many working people are suffering at the hands of their employers.Mr Stephens, speaking during an economy debate, warned the lessons of the past must be heeded as he recalled the history of his constituency.He said: &quot;In Govan, the great Mary Barbour led rent strikes fighting against unscrupulous landlords who increased rents on the home front during that time of sacrifice on the western front.&quot;That might have been a century ago, but we have come full circle as the exploitation of one of the most basic human needs, shelter and a place to raise a family, is once more a key issue in this Parliament.&quot;Mr Stephens, a trade union activist, who defeated Labour's Ian Davidson paid tribute to his predecessor and pledged to continue the fight for workers' rights at Westminster.He focussed his speech on employment and living conditions for working people and those who need the safety net of social security.He added: &quot;We have heard much about the importance of fostering aspiration and celebrating wealth creators. I believe that everyone has aspiration, and it concerns me when the welfare debate is reduced to judging who is deserving and undeserving, seeking the politics of grievance and envy, sowing the seeds of division within our communities.&quot;Welfare sanctions are dragging people to the point of despair, food banks are the only growth industry in too many communities, and the daily grind of low-paid workers on insecure but highly flexible contracts is a world away from the privileged workplace I now find myself in.&quot;We need to step away from the 19th century world of work and the devil-take-the-hindmost approach to social security. That is an economic illiteracy that is not only immoral but ends up costing more in the long run in damage to individuals, families and communities.&quot;

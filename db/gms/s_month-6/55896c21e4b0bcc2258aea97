 JASON Donovan is heading to Scotland after adding 11 dates to his latest UK tour. 
He has confirmed a second Aberdeen show at His Majesty’s Theatre on May 19, 2016 after an earlier show at the city’s Music Hall venue sold out.
Other appearances in March, 2016 include Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and Kilmarnock Grand Hall.
The former Neighbours star’s Ten Good Reasons &amp; Greatest Hits tour will see him perform songs from his multi-platinum 1989 album Ten Good Reaasons and his biggest hit songs.
Taking the number of shows to 31 across the UK, tickets for the new shows go on sale on Friday, June 16 at 9am.
Ten Good Reasons became the biggest selling album of the year when it was released and contains his two solo No.1 singles Too Many Broken Hearts and Sealed with a Kiss.
It also featured a duet with Kylie Minogue, Especially for You, which also reached No.1.
Donovan said: “The response to the tour has been totally overwhelming.
“I have been shocked and humbled by the speed at which these shows sold. Ten Good Reasons was life changing for me the first time around and it’s already proving to be life changing again.
“You know, I’ve never played some of these songs live ever before.
“Music has a wonderful opportunity to put you in a time and place, an emotional connection that no other creative medium can.
“Ten Good Reasons was a defining moment for me and my fans. It was the perfect marriage between music and personality.
“I was 21 at the time ... Wow.
“Too Many Broken Hearts changed my life.
To this very day every time I play that song live the entire audience goes nuts.”

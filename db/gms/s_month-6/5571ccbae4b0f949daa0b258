POLICE investigating the murder of an Irish student have released a CCTV image of a potential witness who may hold vital clues into the killing.
The footage suggests the woman, who was wearing a pink dress, may have important information relating to the probe into the death of Karen Buckley in Glasgow.
She is pictured in the vicinity of where Karen was last seen on April 12.
Footage shows the woman walking on on Dumbarton Road, near to the Gallus Pub at around 12.30am before walking along Church Street.
She then got into a Hackney taxi on Byres Road which drove off towards Great Western Road.
She was wearing a fur jacket and was carrying a large brown shoulder bag.
It is not known whether the woman - who is aged between 18 and 25 - interacted with Karen but police have stressed that she is not connected to Karen's death.

The body of Karen Buckley was found at High Craigton farm, near Drymen, four days later after she was last seen.
Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr said: &quot;Our extensive review of CCTV has identified this young lady near to the Sanctuary Nightclub and the footage indicates that she may have information that could assist with our investigation.
&quot;I must stress that she is in no way connected with the death of Karen but she may have information that could assist with the investigation.
&quot;I would appeal directly to the woman or anyone that recognises her from the image to get in touch with the incident room on 0141 532 5443.
&quot;I can assure you that the public's trust is of paramount importance to Police Scotland and all information passed to us will be treated in the utmost confidence.&quot;

Alexander Pacteau, 21, from Glasgow has appeared in court charged with her murder.

DETECTIVES hunting Scotland’s most wanted man have not heard of a single sighting since he vanished more than six weeks ago.
The Sunday Mail can reveal Martin Hamilton failed to turn up at the High Court in Glasgow where he was due to face historic sex abuse charges.
It is now thought he went AWOL because he feared spending the rest of his life in prison.
There have been claims he could be dead, targeted by a gangland rival, but police don’t believe that.
A specialist team of officers based at London Road Police Office in Glasgow are working round the clock to find him.
Hamilton does not appear to have been in touch with any of his family, friends or criminal associates since he went missing in April. After speaking to Hamilton’s family, police discovered they had not seen him since April 16.
Police say he was close to his elderly mother and would normally keep in regular contact with her.
The public have been warned that Hamilton is “dangerous” and urged not to approach him.
The historic charges against Hamilton involve alleged sex offences against men in the 1990s.
The man leading the hunt, Detective Inspector Dougie McKinlay, said between 30 and 40 of Hamilton’s associates have been quizzed, as well as family members.
 

He added: “We have had no information on Mr Hamilton’s whereabouts.There have been no sightings of him.
“We have no evidence either that he has come to any harm. We think if anything had happened to Mr Hamilton, we would know by now.
“I am keen to speak to anyone who knows where he is.
“I would also appeal to Mr Hamilton to give himself up.”
Police are carrying out checks on bookmakers in Glasgow as Hamilton was a keen gambler.
DI McKinlay also repeated previous police warnings to the public about Hamilton.
He added: “We are concerned that Hamilton may be dangerous and urge members of the public not to approach him but to contact the police if they do see him.”

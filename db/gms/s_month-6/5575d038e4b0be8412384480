Glasgow-based cloud computing company Iomart has bought a consultancy in the sector for at least &pound;9m.
SystemsUp operates out of London and advises clients on how best to use cloud computing.
The deal involves an initial &pound;9m in cash, with the remainder based on performance over the year to March 2016. That could be worth between &pound;1m and &pound;3.5m.
SystemsUp is a partner to Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft.
In the year to March, it had revenue of &pound;4m and doubled profits from the previous year, to &pound;1.5m.
It is to retain its independence of Iomart as a provider of cloud storage capacity, meaning it can recommend to clients that they use the rival companies' services.
Angus MacSween, chief executive of Iomart, said: &quot;The market for cloud computing is becoming incredibly complex and the demand for public cloud services is increasing at pace. 
&quot;With the acquisition of SystemsUp, Iomart has broadened its ability to engage at a strategic level and act as a trusted adviser on cloud strategy to organisations wanting to create the right blend of cloud services, both public and private, to fit their requirements.&quot;
The Glasgow firm will publish its annual results on Tuesday. In April, the firm announced it expected adjusted pre-tax profits for the year to March to be in the region of &pound;16.6m.

A MAN who wrote an offensive online post about tragic soldier  Lee Rigby has been banned from attending football matches.
 Michael Morton, 20, has been given a year-long ban after Police Scotland won a civil case against him. 
Officers claimed he  was involved in a number of football-related disorder  incidents in 2013 but none resulted in a conviction.
 The Sunday Mail exposed Morton after he made jokes on the internet about fusilier Lee , who was attacked and killed close to his barracks in Woolwich, London, in May 2012. 
Morton, from Raploch in Stirling, posted the message after causing outrage among Celtic fans by singing songs about Private Rigby’s death.
 

 He sparked a rumpus  outside a pub in London before a pre-season friendly between Celtic and  Brentford in July 2013. 
After a hearing at  Glasgow Sheriff Court,  John Beckett QC made the banning order.
In a written judgment, he wrote: “The respondent  (Morton) has contributed to disorder in the UK on a number of occasions associated with football matches.”
Police took action against Morton after learning he was linked to Celtic Soccer Crew – a group of football casuals.
As well as mocking  Lee’s death, Morton also boasted on Facebook of stealing Remembrance Day poppies from a McDonald’s restaurant.

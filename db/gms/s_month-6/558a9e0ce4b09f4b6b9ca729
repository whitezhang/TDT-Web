Last ditch plea to save Glasgow University courses from the axeMOVES by a Scottish university to cut funding for a popular community learning programme will force it to close, academics have warned.Glasgow University is planning to withdraw some &pound;500,000 a year from its Centre for Open Studies arguing its long-term future can only be secured when it becomes more financially viable.However, lecturers from the centre said the removal of the funding was more likely to lead to its &quot;imminent demise&quot;.The warning comes as Glasgow University's ruling Court prepares to make a decision over the future of the centre, which could see up to nine staff lose their jobs and some courses close if funding is removed.The university said it was no longer sustainable for it to continue running at a deficit, but pledged to make every effort to avoid compulsory redundancies and preserve the majority of courses - which attract some 4,300 enrolments every year.A statement to Court from centre staff calls for funding to be continued for one year to allow a more thorough discussion of the future and a &quot;less painful&quot; transition for those working there.The statement also calls for the preservation of administrative support staff during the current period of student enrolment and the setting up of a university-wide working group to discuss a sustainable future.The university said the Centre for Open Studies continued to be &quot;very important&quot; and said the vast majority of courses would continue with no change.A university spokesman stressed the subject areas being looked were ones where there was low demand and said courses which helped widen access would be enhanced rather than cut.He said: &quot;Widening access and providing different routes to degree courses for students who have talent and ambition, regardless of economic background or family circumstance, is central to the university.&quot;If approved, the proposals will ensure that the centre continues to provide a balanced and exciting programme that is in sustainable in the long term.&quot;Regrettably, this will involve the loss of some posts, though we will do all we can to manage this process on a voluntary basis and through redeployment where appropriate.&quot;It is the second time in the last few years the adult learning programme at Glasgow University has been threatened. In 2011 there was a public outcry at plans to close the former Department of Adult and Continuing Education as part of wider cost cutting measures.The university eventually recommended keeping the centre open on the understanding it would have have to pay its way as the grant was phased out.The Centre for Open Studies offers some 300 part-time courses for adults as well as a variety of activities throughout the year, including a summer programme and public lectures.Topics include archaeology, art, history, languages, creative writing, literature, music, philosophy and science. Costs range from &pound;15 for half-day courses to &pound;200 for those lasting a week or covering a weekend.

Hard-up parents in Renfrewshire are to be given help in paying for school trips and activities under a council initiative. 
The proposals would see a fund set up to help parents meet the costs of unexpected school costs. 
The council believes the scheme will be the first of its kind in Scotland. 
It is part of a &pound;6m plan aimed at alleviating child poverty in the area, and ensuring all children are given the same opportunities.
Under the plan, which is expected to be approved by councillors later, a &pound;280,000 pot would be created to help disadvantaged parents meet the costs of school trips and other activities. 
It follows a report by the Renfrewshire Tackling Poverty Commission, which identified unexpected school costs as having a major impact on families living below the breadline. 
The move forms part of a proposed schools package that will also pump an extra &pound;1.16m into the area's literacy resources to cut the attainment gap. 
Other measures included in the child poverty initiative include a childcare task force and funding for parents who need someone to look after their children if they are going to job interviews or employment training.
The council also aims to launch a &pound;410,000 team of employment experts to forge sustainable links between pupils, employers and training.
Renfrewshire Council leader Mark Macmillan said: &quot;The Poverty Commission told us that the cost of the school day has a major impact on families who live below the breadline and I want to put a safety net in place to offer them immediate help with costs. 
&quot;More than half of our &pound;6m poverty fund - &pound;3.3m - will deliver a unique schools package to improve early years and close the attainment gap between high and low income households. 
&quot;I want all of Renfrewshire's children to have the same opportunities, and this allocation will see us step up investment in every stage of school.&quot;

It's sink of swim for wedding party heading to ArranA couple had to make some hasty, alternative travel arrangements, after the Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac) ferry strike left their wedding plans all at sea.Fraser Gough and Clare Nicolas were to be married on the Isle of Arran, but their schedule turned sour when the ferry operator announced the cancellation on Monday, June 22.This led to the resourceful mother-of-the-groom contacting her friend, who owns a boat, to ferry the wedding party across the Firth of Clyde from Ardrossan to the island.Although the wedding is today, the newlyweds had arranged a meal for 50 close friends and family last night, leading to the radical travel arrangements.Wedding party member Gordon Halliday said: “It’s affected mainly the core family members that were going to the dinner, and that includes the best man.“Around 20 to 30 people are travelling on this boat - or on a speedboat.&quot;A CalMac spokesman said: “Putting weddings at risk is just one of the very human consequences this strike is having.”RMT Union members in CalMac ferry staff staged the 24-hour strike that decimated services across the country.Only nine of the 27 sailings were running as normal, as the action continued to affect passengers until one minute after midnight on Saturday, June 27.Staff are seeking assurances from ferry operators - that include no redundancies - after the contract for services was tendered out. This could mean it is taken over by a private firm.RMT Regional Organiser (Scotland), Gordon Martin, said: “I’ve been at picket lines in Gourock and Ardrossan - the boats are tied up and they’re going nowhere.&quot;The dispute centres on the Scottish Governments decision to put the contract up for tenure, after Caledonian MacBrayne’s contract came to an end.This has led to the company telling the union that their ‘hands are tied’ by the situation.Mr Martin said: “Caledonian MacBrayne are heavily suggesting that their hands are tied, and if their hands are tied I can only imagine that it is the Scottish Government that are tying them.“I would urge the Scottish Government to ‘untie’ their hands and allow CalMac to resolve this dispute or to get fully involved with myself-and the head negotiating team-to resolve this dispute.”

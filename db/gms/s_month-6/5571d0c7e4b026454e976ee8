CRAFTY drinkers have responded to Scotland’s new tougher drink drive laws by fuelling a boom in schooners.
Sales of the measure - two thirds of a pint - have doubled since December when the alcohol limit for driving was reduced from 80mg to 50 mg in 100 ml blood.
It follows a sharp decline reported by puiblicans of people nipping in to the pub for one drink in the immediate aftermath of the legislation.
But traditional schooners - glasses which hold two-thirds of a pint - are making a comeback following the drink-drive limit reduction.

The market for the smaller tumblers has risen dramatically since December 5, when the law was introduced, with sales more than doubling.
Scotland’s biggest distributor of glasses to the licensed trade said their orders have grown twofold in the last year. and show no sign of abating.
John Cockerell, director of James F Kidd &amp; Son of Edinburgh, said: “Two years ago we were doing less than 2,000 dozen of the schooner glasses a year but that has now gone up to about 5,000 dozen.
“The demand has been so great that we’ve had to take on a third supplier.
“The lower drink-driving limit has made people want to consume a lesser amount of alcohol if they are driving.
“Popularity of craft ales has also had an impact. These drinks have become popular with customers and you can’t or don’t want to consume as much craft ale as regular beer or lager.”
Golf clubs, where traditionally players would have one drink following a round if they are driving, are also ordering schooner glasses so members can still enjoy a drink without worry.
One pub, the Hanging Bat in Edinburgh, has reportedly seen sales rise by 15 per cent by selling beer only in schooners.
Customers are also fuelling a rise in purchases of glasses which contain only a third of a pint.

FILM icon and once Glasgow resident Stan Laurel is the latest face added to Clutha Bar mural.
Usually pictured with comedy partner Oliver Hardy, actor Stan Laurel joins many others as the newest edition to the Clutha Bar artwork. 
The mural put together by Art Pistol, a platform for up-and-coming artists, has captured many famous faces in black and white outside Glasgow’s Clutha Bar. 
The design which stretches around both sides of the bar, depicts various cultural figures from Spike Milligan to Frank Zappa, as well as others who either performed or regularly attended the live music venue.
Laurel has been returned to a familiar street corner haunt, having grown up in Glasgow when his father managed the Metropole Theatre on Stockwell Street in the performer’s early years, a venue which burned down in 1962.
The iconic comedy actor appeared under the stage name ‘Stan Jefferson’ at the Brittania Music Hall in Trongate, performing in pantomime and comedy sketches. One of his forays into on-stage performance. 
His trademark teary gurn has been printed onto the Old Tryst building, between the Clutha and the Victoria Bar. 
Bar owner Alan Crossan plans to reopen the bar in stages, following the devastating helicopter crash on 29 November 2013, in which ten people lost their lives.

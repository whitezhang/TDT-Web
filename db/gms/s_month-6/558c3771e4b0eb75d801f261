A SHAR-PEI named Kai is looking for a home in Scotland after he was dumped by his owner
But Kai wasn’t found with a bag of belongings at Ayr Train Station -- he was discovered more than 1,000 miles away in Hungary. 
Emaciated and in pain after his owner callously tied him to a tree in the middle of a forest, Kai was close to death. 
He was eventually found and moved to a Hungarian kill shelter and faced death, when Shar-Pei Rescue and Support Scotland (SPRSS) heard about him.
Kai was saved and transported to Scotland for a new life. 
Since then he has undergone treatment for horrendous eye and ear infections while learning to live and socialise with other dogs. 
He has spent almost a year being fostered by Laura Cumming, 45, from Saltcoats, Ayrshire sharing her home with four other Shar-Pei dogs.
Laura said: “The condition he was found in was horrific. He was basically a walking skeleton. His eyes were infected, his ears were full of gunk. 
“But he’s actually really well behaved. He’s laid back and like a bear. 
“He’s been crossed with something so he is bigger than most Shar-Pei. But he thinks he is a Chihuahua.”
Laura has now appealed for an animal lover to adopt Kai and give him a ‘fur-ever home’. 
She added: “The work the Shar-Pei Rescue and Support Scotland has done with him and the work they do with all the Shar-Pei is amazing. 
“When he arrived he was terrified. I think he would be suited to an active family, where his owners can give him the chance to run. I would love to see him in the countryside.” 
Gina McCallum, who runs SPRSS and is currently looking after 14 Shar-Pei, added: “The Shar-Pei is a misunderstood breed. 
“People buy them as puppies because they love the wrinkles but they are a dominant breed and need training. 
“We have around 100 every year. If we can find a home for Kai it means there is a new space to save another. He is a big boy but he is lovely.”

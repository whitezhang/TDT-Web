A man who is serving more than 12 years in jail for killing a schoolgirl in a drug-fuelled hit-and-run crash has been sentenced for handling stolen goods.
Christopher Hannah crashed into Sophie Brannan and two others in Glasgow's Maryhill area on 14 November last year.
At Glasgow Sheriff Court, he was handed a 245 day sentence after admitting the reset of two guitars and an electronic book in March last year. 
He will not spend extra time in jail as the sentence will run concurrently.
Hannah, who was a heroin addict, admitted a charge of culpable homicide over the death of Sophie Brannan. 
He also admitted dangerous driving, attempting to defeat the ends of justice and possessing heroin.
His trial at the High Court in Glasgow heard that he was driving a hired Vauxhall Astra in the Maryhill area and lost control. 
He then fully mounted the pavement before hitting the gable end of a nearby building. 
However, the car continued to career forward eventually ploughing into Sophie and the two people with her from behind. 
She was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones. 
The schoolgirl remained in intensive care overnight, but she never recovered and was pronounced dead the following morning.

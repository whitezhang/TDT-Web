By HANNAH RODGERKEN MACINTOSH has vowed to campaign against the Care Tax if he wins the Scottish Labour leadership race.During his first policy speech since announcing he will run for the position last week, the Eastwood MP said he would make the case to scrap the controversial local tax.The local authority charges, which can be up to &pound;20 an hour in some cases, are for both residential and non-residential social care services.Speaking in Kilmarnock at the Scottish Pensioners Forum Annual Conference yesterday, Mr Macintosh said that under his leadership, Scottish Labour will be a constructive opposition at Holyrood.He said: &quot;Too many people in Scotland are still facing poverty or loneliness in old age.&quot;We can bemoan and resist the welfare cuts agenda but we can do so much more using the powers of the Scottish Parliament.&quot;Scottish Labour worked with others in the first years of devolution to introduce two of the most successful and liberating of policies for older people - the free bus pass and free personal and nursing care.&quot;We need to return to that positive agenda.&quot;We should ensure the decisions we take here in Scotland reflect the values we hold and the kind of caring compassionate society we want to see.&quot;A good start would be to abolish the care tax.&quot;Meanwhile, as the Labour hopeful made his first leadership big policy speech, a Glasgow MP was making his first speech in Westminster.Stewart McDonald, MP for Glasgow South made his maiden speech last night during a debate the House of Commons.The SNP MP spoke of his constituency and his home in Castlemilk, and said: &quot;...I am the first Member of this House to be born in one of the most famous parts of my constituency, Castlemilk.Castlemilk has featured in the three maiden speeches of my predecessors, Mr Speaker. Often it is referenced when talking about urban deprivation, housing and other social problems.So I want to change that.&quot;He also spoke strongly about the SNP's stance on the EU referendum, and added: &quot;Scotland is a profoundly outward looking European Nation.I and my 55 colleagues were sent to this House to argue for our position in Europe.We were sent to this House to argue for the rights of young people and of European nationals living in Scotland to have a say on our future in Europe.&quot;If Scotland is dragged out of Europe against its will, and on the votes of voters in England, then that will be the result they did not see coming.&quot; ...I stand here as the accuser of a government that wants to make my country look inward, its people small and its citizens divided.&quot;We will oppose this in the most vociferous manner.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

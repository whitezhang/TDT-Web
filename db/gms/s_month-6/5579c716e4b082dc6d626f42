A VILE rapist who brutally attacked three young women has been jailed for nine years and six months.Zach Rankin, 23, befriended the young women - and a girl aged just 15 - before subjecting them to horrific sexual ordeals.The arrogant sex predator even showed off his hatred of women by uploading to YouTube a song in which he sung about degrading women.At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Bannatyne jailed him on five charges of rape and six charges of assault.Ordering him to be supervised for four years following his release from custody, Lord Bannatyne added: &quot;You have been convicted of a series of violent sexual assaults.&quot;You engaged in a violent course of conduct against these women and have left them traumatised. You have also been assessed of being a significant risk towards women.&quot;Accordingly, I must impose an extended sentence.&quot;Rankin, a prisoner of HMP Barlinnie, was convicted on the rape and violence charges following proceedings last month at the High Court in Livingston.He preyed on the women between January 2010 and May 2014.One of Rankin's victims, a 24-year-old mum told the court how Rankin repeatedly raped her in a flat in Pollokshields, Glasgow,.A victims - who cannot be identified for legal reasons - told the court how Rankin used silk scarves and other items to choke her in bed.His youngest victim, now a 20-year-old student - said she was 15 when she had unlawful sex with Rankin.The court also heard that the businessman - who had his own telemarketing and sales businesses - used degrading language towards the women.During his trial, Rankin denied sexual assault and said all the women had given their consent.He claimed they all told lies because they had grudges against him.However, a jury refused to believe his claims and returned guilty verdicts against him.It also emerged that in his bizarre YouTube video, uploaded in 2014, guitar playing Rankin sang about degrading women.On Thursday, defence solicitor advocate John Scott QC told the court that his client had became &quot;more humble&quot; in recent weeks.Rankin was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

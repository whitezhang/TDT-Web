People still smoking in hospital groundsPATIENTS are already flouting a no-smoking ban in the grounds of Glasgow's new &pound;842million hospital.Pictures obtained by the Evening Times show two patients lighting up, just yards from the entrance to the hospital.Both in clear view of a sign that states &quot;this is a non-smoking hospital campus.&quot;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Director of Public Health said she was &quot;disappointed&quot; that people were continuing to flout the ban.The board plans to introduce smoking wardens at the hospital following other hospitals including the Royal Infimary.All patients, visitors and staff are now banned from smoking in NHS grounds across the whole of Scotland.The move to achieve smoke-free status in the grounds of every hospital, health centre and NHS building across the country is part of a national drive to create a tobacco-free generation in Scotland by 2034.Dr Linda de Caestecker, Director of Public Health, NHSGGC, said: &quot;Despite a national move to create smoke free grounds we are aware that some people continue to smoke on our healthcare sites.“Like every other Board in Scotland we have done a huge amount of work to remind people that our grounds are smoke free.“We are disappointed that despite all the measures in place, and staff repeatedly asking smokers to stop, some people insist on ignoring our policy and continue to smoke at the entrances and grounds?.“We plan to implement more measures including the introduction of smoke free wardens on the new hospitals campus together with new branding and signage from the national Green Curtain Smoke Free Grounds campaign“We also implore smokers to think of our staff, other visitors and patients when lighting up and to do so away from our hospital entrances.”

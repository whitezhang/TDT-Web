A HOUSEHUNTER has offered the &pound;300,000 asking price for Scots serial killer Dennis Nil&shy;&shy;sen’s House of Horrors.
The refurbished one-bedroom attic flat is on a prime street in fashionable north London suburb Muswell Hill.
But its grisly past of drains clogged with human remains slashed its price to &pound;100,000 less than identical homes in the street.
A note in capitals on the ad says: “Buyers are kindly asked to research the history of this property.”
One woman who viewed it said: “I’m sure it will make a nice home for someone, and a tidy bargain, but I wouldn’t spend the night under that roof.”
However, a cash buyer has now come forward with the full &pound;300,000 asked for the flat at No23 Cranley Gardens.
From 1978 to 1983, Fraserburgh-born Jobcentre clerk Nilsen, now 69, killed at least 15 homeless gay men and rent boys he lured to two homes, carving up and boiling the remains then flushing them away or hiding them.
 

He got life in 1983 and has been told he will die in jail.
 The property last sold at auction for &pound;250,000 in 2013. It is not believed to have been occupied  recently. Sagar Kanani, assistant manager at estate agent Paul Simon, said: “The average price for the area is around &pound;375,000 to &pound;400,000 for a similar property – this is without a doubt a bargain. 
“It’s a nice flat with some people joking, distastefully, it has killer views.
“With the background of the property, most people would not want to be involved.
“It’s not for the mass market because most people would not want to live somewhere a serial killer has carried out their deeds.”

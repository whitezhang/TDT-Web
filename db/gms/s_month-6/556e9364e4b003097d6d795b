GLASGOW neurologist Iain Horrocks is gearing up for a tough fundraising challenge laid down by a colleague - and top chef Gordon Ramsay.The 43-year-old from Blanefield is one of Gordon's GR100 who will take part in the Staffordshire half-Ironman on June 14.The gruelling event, which includes a 1.2 mile swim, a 56-mile bike ride and a half marathon, will raise cash for the Scottish Spina Bifida Association through the Gordon Ramsay Foundation.It was Dr Margo Whiteford, chairwoman of the SSBA, a former Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year and Iain's colleague, who challenged him to do it.&quot;My initial reaction was no but knowing I could really make a difference to the charity made me say yes instead,&quot; smiles Iain.Iain, a consultant paediatric neurologist at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Yorkhill, treats many young patients with spina bifida.&quot;I'm aware of the acute problems they face, and I am always inspired by their attitude,&quot; he says.&quot;They are such good fun and just crack on with life despite their circumstances.&quot;Iain, who accompanied cyclist Sir Chris Hoy to Africa with UNICEF as part of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last summer, is training hard for the challenge.A keen sportsman, he skis, kayaks, cycles to work and completed a coast-to-coast triathlon several years ago.&quot;But these days I'm just worried my knees will hold up,&quot; he smiles. &quot;Training is hard when I'm on call but my family - my wife and three sons, aged eight, 11 and 12, help and support me.&quot;I'm really nervous - when I hear how athletic the other competitors are it scares me.&quot;SSBA chairwoman Dr Whiteford says: &quot;I knew Iain was a keen sportsman but I have been blown away by his commitment to the charity and his training regime.&quot;He is doing this for the 3500 children and young adults throughout Scotland who are affected by spina bifida and hydrocephalus.&quot;The majority of those affected by the condition will be born paralysed from the waist down and will have severe bladder and bowel problems.Around 80 per cent will have hydrocephalus, which often causes neurological disorders including problems with speech, concentration and organisational skills.There is no known cure for spina bifida and hydrocephalus.Both are lifelong, complex disabilities which can affect any pregnancy, regardless of the mother's age, background or nationality.To support Iain and the SSBA visit www.justgiving.com/Iain-horrocks.

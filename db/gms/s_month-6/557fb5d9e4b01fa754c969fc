SCOTRAIL staff were on hand to deal with possible rail disruptions on the first day of major works between Glasgow and Edinburgh.Around 200 additional customer service staff assembled across Central Scotland as passengers are expected to face six weeks of disruption with the Winchburgh tunnel near Linlithgow being closed to allow upgrades to be carried out.The Scotrail workforce at Glasgow Queen Street advised passengers on their best travel options while the works are being carried out.40 dedicated replacement buses have also been put in place to shuttle between Linlithgow and Haymarket.Ethel Watson, 60, travels from her hometown of Sunnyside 5 days a week for her job. She had no complaints about the service. She said: &quot;It was just normal services. All I noticed was buses.&quot;I think later services might have been affected but I was fine since I take an early train.&quot;Innes Davidson, 37, from Bathgate, said: &quot;There was a different system at the train station directing people onto the train and I had to queue.&quot;It was a bit busier than usual but I still managed to get a seat.&quot;The work is part of a &pound;750m project to enable faster, bigger and greener electric trains to run on the line and ScotRail has a dedicated website to help with the disruption.Jackie Brazil, from Mount Vernon takes the train from Shettleston into Glasgow. She said: &quot;It was just normal this morning.&quot;I'm really hoping my train home isn't disrupted though.&quot;There was also complimentary tea and coffee on hand to ease travellers as they faced queues to get on their desired train.Direct travel between Glasgow and Edinburgh was still available via the Airdrie-Bathgate line to Queen Street and the Shotts line to Central.A ScotRail Alliance spokesperson said: &quot;We're pleased with how the first working day of the Winchburgh timetable has gone.&quot;It is already apparent that customers have heeded our advice, planned their journey, and set off earlier. We're closely monitoring customer feedback and will continue to fine tune our plans based on what people tell us and how they are actually travelling.&quot;Our overall objective is to minimise the impact on our customers and enable them to travel by train wherever possible.&quot;Work in the tunnel is progressing well, with engineers currently removing the existing track and beginning to dig out the ballast beneath in preparation for lowering the tunnel floor.&quot;We will have hundreds of staff working around-the-clock over the next six weeks to finish this vital project as quickly as possible.&quot;

Thought zombies were bad? Wait til Jags mascot Kingsley takes over George SquareHE'S divided opinion, he's made global headlines and now he's being let loose on George Square.Kingsley, the famous - or infamous - Partick Thistle mascot, will be heading to the city centre in the hope Jags fans turn out to meet him.Club bosses say controversial Kingsley is feeling unloved after the press coverage since his launch.A statement said: &quot;We're hoping that as many Thistle fans as possible will turn up in George Square to meet him. Jags tops and scarfs are a must with selfies and pictures with Kingsley, shared on twitter with the hashtag #thistlesquare, compulsory.&quot;Designed by renowned artist David Shrigley, Kingsley has been compared to everything from a badly-aged Lisa Simpson to an angry sun.Partick Thistle chiefs say George Square has previously been the site of World War Z zombie terror - but it hasn't seen anything yet.They added: &quot;The sight though of over 1,000 rotting undead corpses marauding through the centre of Glasgow is nothing compared to the terror that the citizens of Glasgow are going to experience in George Square on Tuesday June 30th when our world famous, or should that be infamous, mascot Kingsley is let loose on the unsuspecting citizens of our formally dear green place.&quot;Unlike World War Z we can't promise Brad Pitt but we think we offer even better. As well as Kinglsey, a number of Thistle players will be there and, of course, this will be the first time the brand new Thistle kit will be on display.&quot;This is a not to be missed occasion for Thistle and non Thistle fans alike. Assuming you are brave enough to come along.&quot;The occasion is the launch of the new Partick Thistle kit for season 2015-2016.Kingsley will be in George Square at 1pm next Tuesday.

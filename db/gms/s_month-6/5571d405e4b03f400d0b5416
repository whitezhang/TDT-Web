THE first strikes over pay in Scottish schools for nearly 30 years have come a step closer.Members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union backed unanimously the use of industrial action unless progress on salaries is made with local authority employers.EIS members staged a walk-out in 2011 as part of a wider public sector protest over changes to pensions, but the last time the sector held a strike on pay was in 1986.The EIS is demanding a pay increase of 5% to redress a decline in salary levels over the past few years, but councils offered 2.5% over two years instead, which has now been rejected.Delegates at the EIS annual general meeting in Perth backed a motion from the union's Dundee local association calling for a campaign for a &quot;restorative&quot; pay deal, adding: &quot;If no satisfactory outcome is forthcoming, members are to be balloted for industrial action up to and including strike action.&quot;Tom Tracey, convener of the EIS salaries committee, said: &quot;We need to go out of here and speak to our members and say to them that this is a possibility. There is no point waiting for the negotiations to bed down.&quot;

Plans to introduce a &quot;soft opt-out&quot; system for organ donation in Scotland are to be published at Holyrood. 
Labour's Anne McTaggart has support from MSPs of all parties for her bill.
The current &quot;opt-in&quot; system requires a proactive choice by an individual to register to become a organ donor on their death. 
The Scottish government said it would examine the bill to see if a &quot;convincing case&quot; could be made for a move to an opt-out system.
The new legislation would mean people would have to actively opt out or else their name would be added to the NHS Organ Donation Register. 
Under the terms of the &quot;soft opt-out&quot; system, families of deceased patients would be given a say on donation if they could confirm their relative had made an unrecorded objection during their lifetime.
Ms McTaggart, who will introduce the bill, cited evidence which said three people died every day across the UK waiting for a transplant. She claimed her legislation could &quot;save lives&quot;. 
The Glasgow MSP said: &quot;I'm confident that the overwhelming evidence in favour of my proposals will ensure the success of my bill.&quot;
According to the government, there has been a 63% increase in the number of transplants carried out on Scottish patients since 2007.
Maureen Watt, minister for public health, said: &quot;There is currently no consensus amongst experts as to whether this would make a significant difference and the international evidence in not clear.
&quot;However the Scottish government welcomes any debate in relation to the important issues of organ donation and transplantation.&quot;
Ms Watt added: &quot;In Scotland we lead the UK in increasing donation and transplantation numbers. 
&quot;The transplant waiting list is now at its lowest level to-date. In addition, 41% of Scots are signed up to the NHS Organ Donor Register - the highest percentage of any of the four UK countries.&quot;
Scottish TV presenter Lorraine Kelly supported the bill, saying it was a &quot;unique opportunity for people to leave behind an amazing gift&quot;.
The British Heart Foundation was also backing the bill.

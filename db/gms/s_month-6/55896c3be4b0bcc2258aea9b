A SCOTS Army veteran hopes to smash the world record for the biggest ever bootcamp to raise cash for injured comrades.
Jamie Kennedy’s career as a soldier was cut short when he damaged his knee in Afghanistan six years ago.
The injury led to him being discharged from the army after 11 years.
The 33-year-old, from Glasgow, has now launched his own military-style personal training.
He now hopes to get thousands of people to take part in a massive training session to raise cash for Erskine, who provide care and support for veterans.

Jamie, of Anniesland, said: “The current record is 2061 participants in Australia in 2013. I’m confident I can do it.
“I’d like to get 6000 people there. I’m looking for a venue and sponsors, but we’re looking at September.”

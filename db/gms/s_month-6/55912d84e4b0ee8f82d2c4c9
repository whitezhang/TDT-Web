Scottish holidaymakers return home from TunisiaScots holidaymakers returning on a flight from Tunisia today said they were glad to be home, but felt for resort staff.Many of the passengers arriving at Glasgow Airport had opted to end their break early and take the specially-chartered Thomson flight which arrived at 6.10am.Aamer Saeed, 37, from Glasgow's west end, was meant to be on holiday with his children, aged eight and 12, for another week.He said: &quot;The kids were really scared and they didn't want to stay any longer. There was nothing you could do anyway, you just had to stay in.&quot;I feel sorry for the people there, it's not their fault. But it was frightening. We just stayed in the hotel, everything was cancelled.&quot;Natalie Martin, a mother from Falkirk, said: &quot;It was quite scary, we are just glad to be back home.&quot;The guys in the hotel tried to keep it upbeat for the families there but it was hard. Most of the hotel came back early.&quot;She said she felt &quot;a bit let down&quot; by the support offered to tourists.She said: &quot;We had to keep going to the rep all the time, asking if we were safe. We had to keep going to them.&quot;Rick Martin, 52, from Peterhead in Aberdeenshire, was staying two hotels along the coast and was on a day trip away when the massacre happened.He said: &quot;We found out on Friday afternoon, we got phone calls from the UK. It's very sad.Asked about the support provided to holidaymakers, he said: &quot;A young lassie, 21 years old, did her best. She told us what she knew.&quot;One female traveller, who did not want to be named, said: &quot;The support has been great. I just feel for the local people, because it's their livelihood.&quot;Yesterday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon chaired a second Scottish Government resilience (SGORR) meeting.Ms Sturgeon said: ''I would like to offer my heartfelt sympathies to everyone who may have lost a loved one in this attack.''We are prepared for the possibility that there may be Scottish victims among those who have lost their lives.&quot;Prayers have been said for Jim and Ann McQuire, from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, who were killed in the attack, while Holly Graham, from Perth, has said she is concerned about her parents Billy and Lisa, who had been staying at one of the hotels attacked in Sousse.

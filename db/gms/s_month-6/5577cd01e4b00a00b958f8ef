Former Rangers manager, Ally McCoist formally opened the new 'Tranquil Space' Garden to the community today at St Vincent's Hospice in Howwood, Renfrewshire.Mr McCoist said, &quot;I feel honoured to be asked to open the Garden today. The care provided by St Vincent's Hospice touches the lives and hearts of so many local families - it is a privilege to be able to offer my support. I know this wonderful garden will become a much-loved place where the whole community can enjoy the peace and beauty of nature.&quot;The new garden has been a labour of love for staff and volunteers at the Hospice. Over the past few months the rural landscape around the Hospice building in Howwood has gradually been transformed into a beautiful garden which is now accessible to the whole community.A paved pathway meanders through five different sections of the garden, from the Rose Garden, past St Vincent's Tree and the Retreat, through Forget-me-not and into the Sensory Garden. At the bottom of the gentle slope, Rest-a-while offers a quiet and reflective space beside a pond.The Garden is a long-held dream of the charity's Chief Executive, Kate Lennon and her staff and volunteers. &quot;We hope that the whole community will enjoy the new garden and see it as a shared space which is accessible to anyone who wants to use it.&quot; said Ms Lennon. &quot;Of course, the garden will also benefit all those who currently use the Hospice; in time it will become an extension of the care and support that our patients and their families receive within the building itself&quot;.Construction of the Garden was very generously funded by donations and support from the Landfill Community Fund, the Malcolm Group, National Lottery Awards for All and Helping Hands Association. The garden design work was undertaken by students from SRUC College in Ayr.Planting is already well under way, and local people have already dedicated a number of trees and shrubs in celebration of their loved ones. The Garden is large and there is still space to fill - as well as rabbit-proof fences to buy. If you would like to make a contribution toward the further development of the Garden, or to make a dedication of your own, please call St Vincent's Hospice on 01505 705635 or email info@svh.co.uk

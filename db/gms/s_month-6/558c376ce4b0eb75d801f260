THE youngest elected MP for over 300 years has bagged a first class politics degree.
Unlike many of her graduating peers, Mhairi Black knew that she had job security after her final exams after being elected in a landslide victory in this year’s General Election.
The 20 year-old will graduate from the University of Glasgow, along with the rest of her politics class on Friday.
Her final exam was on Scottish politics which, after campaigning extensively as a SNP candidate, the former chip shop worker knew more about than most.
She overturned a 16,000 deficit into a 5,500 vote-winning margin to unseat the Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander.
She has said that she was “really proud” to have passed her exams and to receive a first class honours degree.
The youngest MP since the 17th century had crammed in intensive reading sessions between debates in London.
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: “We would like to congratulate Mhairi Black, as we would all of our students who are graduating this summer. 
“They have all worked extremely hard to earn their degrees and we wish them the very best for their future careers.”

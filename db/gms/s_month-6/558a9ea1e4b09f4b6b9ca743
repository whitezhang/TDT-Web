Schoolchildren cleaning up their local areaSCHOOLS have been enthusiastic supporters of Streets Ahead from the start.Primary, secondary, nursery and assisted support for learning schools have all joined in with gusto, dreaming up an ever-growing list of impressive projects designed to improve their communities.Leading the way was Whiteinch Primary in the west end, who took an innovative approach to cleaning up their neighbourhood.Pupils filmed their litter-picking activities as part of an environmental initiative supported by Clean Glasgow. They showed the film of their efforts in Victoria Park to other pupils, inspiring them to get involved.Clean Glasgow Neighbourhood Improvement and Enforcement Officer David Walker said: “The pupils at Whiteinch Primary came up with a really unusual and creative way of tackling litter problems and it was fantastic.”Pupils at Wellshot Primary in the east end made good use of their very own ‘forest’ as part of our Streets Ahead campaign.As one of the few schools in Glasgow to have a woodland in their playground, they decided to transform it from an unused space into a beautiful garden, play park and planting area.And the dedicated bunch also reached out to their local community, organising litter picks in the surrounding streets, and collecting rubbish from the park.Pupil Rhian Zammit summed it up. “We’re doing it because we want everyone to enjoy the park and be proud of it.”

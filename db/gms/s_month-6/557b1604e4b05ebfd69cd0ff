A property firm is to press ahead with a multi-million pound student development in Glasgow after acquiring a prime site in the city's west end.
Select Property Group plans to create 441 self-contained studios at the 2.9-acre site located next to the University of Glasgow.
The total value of the completed development project will be &pound;67m.
The site will be developed, let and managed under Select Property Group's Vita Student brand.
Select's chief executive, Mark Stott, said the site purchase was a major milestone for the business. 
He added: &quot;Glasgow is Scotland's largest city and houses six universities which attract an international market of more than 80,000 students as one of Europe's most popular places to study. 
&quot;The redevelopment of the city's west end presents an outstanding opportunity for us to deliver a legacy of unique and inspirational living environments for the students of Glasgow.&quot;
Work on the site is scheduled to start later this month.

Three men have admitted carrying out a &pound;200,000 daylight jewellery raid at the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow last year.
Jason Yendall, 29, Aaron Brannan, 24, and Jason Britton, 23, stole high-value watches in front of stunned shoppers on 24 September 2014.
They were caught after two friends - Alistair Oliver, 30, and Gordon McLay, 32, - were seen wearing stolen watches.
All five also admitted being involved in a &pound;20,000 bank robbery in Edinburgh. They will be sentenced next month.

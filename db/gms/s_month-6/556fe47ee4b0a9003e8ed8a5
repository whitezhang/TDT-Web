MPs paid tribute to the "golden boy from the Highlands" yesterday during a special Westminster session to the Former Lid Dem leader.Mr Kennedy's ex-wife Sarah and 10-year-old son Donald looked on from a side gallery as MPs shared their memories of him.As reported in the Evening Times, the former MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber, died at home in Fort William on Tuesday.Speaking during the afternoon session yesterday, David Cameron said the House was &quot;shocked and so deeply saddened&quot; by the sudden news.The Prime Minster said: &quot;...It is a tragic loss for his family, not least his son Donald, who is just 10 years old, and I know that the thoughts and prayers of the whole House are with his family and his friends at this time.&quot;Mr Cameron described him as a man whose &quot;character and courage inspired us all&quot; and &quot;will be remembered for his success, for his principle and intellect, and above all for his incredible warmth and good humour.&quot;Harriet Harman, interim leader of the Labour party, described the 55-year-old as &quot;the golden boy from the Highlands.&quot; when he was elected at the age of 23.She said: &quot;He shone in this Chamber. He was elected so young, and it is a tragedy that he has died so young. All our thoughts are with his family.&quot;History will show that he was one of a great generation of Scottish MPs, at a time when Scotland gave this House some of the finest politicians of the era.&quot;Exceptional politicians such as John Smith, Donald Dewar, Gordon Brown, Menzies Campbell, Robin Cook-he stands tall in a Scottish generation who were head and shoulders above their peers.&quot;Lib Dem Leader Nick Clegg said there was &quot;so much&quot; he would miss about his fellow party member including &quot;his wit, his warmth [and] his modesty.&quot;He continued: &quot;He was a proud Highlander, a proud Scot and a man who believed in our community of nations within the United Kingdom, but he was also a lifelong believer that our outward-facing character as a country is best secured by remaining at the heart of Europe rather than retreating elsewhere.&quot;As the debate becomes dominated, as it no doubt will, by the noise of statistical claim and counter-claim, I will miss the lyrical clarity of Charles's belief that our future as an open-hearted and generous-spirited country is at stake and must be defended at all costs.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

A CHARITY could be forced to cancel its only disabled nightclub event in Scotland if the Arches club closes.C Change - a supported living charity - has been hosting its LATE nights at the club in the archways under Central Station for nearly four years.Organisers say the event, open to its dates-n-mates members and others with learning difficulties, is the only one of its kind in the country and they would struggle to find another suitable venue.Joyce Innes, of C Change, said the Arches was a 'brilliant' venue and the only one with the capacity and support to allow them to host the event, usually held three or four times a year.She said: &quot;There's huge demand for it - we had been planning to increase the number to five a year, it's been so successful.&quot;We had three last year and they attract people from across Scotland. We have people coming down from Aberdeen.&quot;It's the only venue where we can hold a proper club night and we get more than 200 people. It's a proper club night.&quot;The nights include music from Capital FM radio DJ Garry Spence and DJ Bowers. They are aimed at helping those who feel daunted by going to a nightclub for the first time or who feel excluded from the experience to enjoy themselves and feel safe.Sam Smith, C Change executive director, said: &quot;The Arches is a leading arts and cultural venue that really understands the meaning of equality and inclusion.&quot;The impact of these club nights goes far beyond a night of good music and dancing. They have also raised aspirations, forged lasting relationships and opened up a world of opportunity for people with learning disabilities in an exciting, safe and inclusive environment.&quot;DJ Garry Spence said it would be &quot;devastating&quot; if the Arches could no longer host the event.He said: &quot;C-Change provides what I strongly believe is an essential service in making sure everybody has the right and the access to a large scale music event, regardless of disability.&quot;Andrew McCartney, a dates-n-mates member, said: &quot;If LATE stopped, it would mean I don't get to see my friends who I meet up with at the Arches.&quot;It's the first club I've got to go to. I think all people from dates-n-mates and outside of dates-n-mates would be very upset and disappointed. There would be nowhere else to go that's safe. They need to keep the Arches open.&quot;LATE DJ Rory Hoy said the closure of the Arches, following a licensing decision last month, would be a &quot;real tragedy&quot; for the nights.He said: &quot;I have been travelling up from Yorkshire to do these events as I've enjoyed them so much, and I know how much work all the organisers have put in, working together with the organisers at The Arches to making these evenings a real success story and one Scotland should really be proud of.&quot;I hope, with all my heart, they will be allowed to continue.&quot;The Arches board is to appeal against the decision to curtail its licensed hours, essentially closing the club which supports its arts activities.More than 38,000 people have signed an online petition urging a reversal of the decision.The appeal is likely to be heard in August. Funding has been provided by Creative Scotland and Glasgow City Council to support its programme in the short term.

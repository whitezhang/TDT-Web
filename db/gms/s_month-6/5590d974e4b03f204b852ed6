East End charity appeal to get rid of large greenhouse on new premisesCHILDREN’S charity The Happy Club is putting out an unusual appeal to get rid of a giant greenhouse at their new premises in the East End.The charity, who are previous winners at the Evening Times Community Champion Awards, work with children affected by autism but also provide help to youngsters with disability or who are vulnerable or in isolation.The hope is to turn the back garden into a wide outdoor space for the children to enjoy; however, the large greenhouse is currently restricting this dream from being fulfilled.Charity co-ordinator Tracy Steell, who is also a previous winner at the Evening Times Community Champion Awards for her dedication to the charity, is keen to get rid of the greenhouse.She said: “The greenhouse is becoming a hinder to the children’s chances of getting outside and having fun.“A lot of the kids that we care for are not able to get outside and play at home so the massive garden we now have gives us the chance to let our children do this.“Many of them will be overwhelmed at the freedom and the ability to play more.”The charity is appealing to someone who knows how to dismantle this large building and is aware of the health and safety aspects.Tracy said: “I even phoned Dobbies garden centre to ask if they would take it off my hands but they never got back to me.“It’s such a waste sitting there and not being used.”The greenhouse was previously used by Wise Group, who make a difference in local communities. The organisation grew plants in the greenhouse and then sold them.The group have said they would be “delighted to see it go.”They greenhouse is fully equipped with electricity and heaters but would need rigorous health and safety checks before being put to use.The Happy Club was established in 2007 aiming to reduce the isolation of families in Glasgow who have one or more children affected by disability or autism.The charity was set up by Tracy Steell and a group of parents who felt the community lacked a group that helped children with disabilities.Tracy has three children with autism and her sons were the main reason she set up the club.The Happy Club is currently run by a group of volunteers who are the parents of the 40 children the charity cares for.They are now starting to accommodate those on their waiting list due to the big move to their own premises.The building will also be the first wheelchair accessible premises for the charity.With the new premises the growing group are able to continue to carry out arts and sports with the children on a larger scale.

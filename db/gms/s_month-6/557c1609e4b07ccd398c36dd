FAMILIES and young children will be given a helping hand with the creation of a new partnership.The aim of the Possilpark partnership is to engage the community and provide help and support to people in need.The partnership between Evening Times Community Champions Young Peoples Futures, Stepping Stones for Families and Bernardos, with the help of Hawthorn Housing Co-operative, has secured funding to provide this help.By creating the partnership it is hoped that they can combine their skills and ideas to significantly improve and help the community.The partnership will support existing community assets and all partners will work closely with each other to provide the best service for Possilpark residents.Advice will be on offer to families, including financial help and parenting tips as well as a drop in centre when families and parents most want and need it.The drop-in and advice services will be open at night until 10pm and at the weekends when other facilities typically close.The services have been designed to fit in with the needs of people in the community; it is a different way to provide help and support.A mandarin translator and worker will be available to help engage and get the large number of Chinese participating in community events and services.The launch of Positive Possilpark took place at Possilpark Community Centre.For children under the age of five there will be storytelling and other fun activities from 1pm-3pm. The older children are encouraged to go along and join in with arts and crafts and explore what's on offer in the IT suite.Information about Positive Possilpark and what it entails will be available to parents and carers at the launch as well as tea, coffee, juice and fruit refreshments.Helen Graham of Hawthorne Housing Co-operative said: &quot;It is an excellent example of what can be achieved by a small registered social landlord working alongside families and community organisations.&quot;Ann Lawrence of Young People's Future said: &quot;Positive Possilpark will bring new opportunities for local children, young people and families.&quot;By working together the community will benefit from increased resources and will be involved in developing services for the future.&quot;

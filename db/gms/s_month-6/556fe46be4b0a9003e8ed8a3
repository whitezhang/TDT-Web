A SCHOOL transport boss has been fined and ordered to "significantly" change his ways after failing to operate a local bus service.Thomas Arthur, owner of Arthur's Coaches in Coatbridge was hit with a &pound;1000 penalty from the Traffic Commissioner after an investigation found he did not run the 215 Kirkwood to Coatbridge circular.Three of his 10 vehicle licenses will also be removed from the end of June, following an investigation into safety by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA).Mr Arthur was found to not be operating the 215 service in August last year, after the DVSA were tipped off the service had stopped one month early.Investigators monitored the service on August 11 2014 and did not see any signs of it at Coatbridge South Circular Road and Woodside Street at Manse Avenue, despite Mr Arthurs claims that it was running.The businessman, who runs services to St Andrew's Secondary and St Margaret's High, was also found to have prohibitions issued to his vehicles for defects.His annual test history was well below the national average, which Mr Arthur blamed on the age of the buses during the investigation.The Traffic Commissioner Joan Aitken noted that while not all was bad with Mr Arthur's vehicle maintenance arrangements, he had been on notice every time one of his vehicles failed at annual test and that they were not roadworthy.Ms Aitken said: &quot;This simply is not good enough as he now accepts,&quot;&quot;I am satisfied that the 215 did not operate on that day in August 2014.&quot;Mr Arthur brought productions to this public inquiry but it was interesting what he did not bring, including that he did not bring any evidence of monitoring last August.&quot;Nor did he bring any evidence to support that any purported ticket machine breakdown was in play at this time.&quot;Nor did he produce any contemporaneous response to the [DVSA] monitoring.&quot;Mr Arthur will now have three licenses removed from June 30, and will be required to pay his &pound;1000 penalty by the same date.Mr Arthur said: &quot;I accept the Traffic Commissioner's decision.&quot;I am pleased the Traffic Commissioner recognised the improvements I have made.&quot;I strive to provide a quality service for all of my passengers.&quot;

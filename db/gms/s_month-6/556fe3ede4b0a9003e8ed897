COUNCILS and rail companies need to work together to improve access around the main stations according to transport campaigners.Concerns were raised over the &pound;120m redevelopment of Queen Street Station over access from surrounding streets and lack of cycle parking spaces.MSPs were told that while the focus of Network Rail was on the station itself the city centre streets were the responsibility of the city council.Campaigners said there feared plans were so advanced they would be unable to force change and noted a lack of engagement from Network Rail.The Scottish Parliament Infrastructure Committee heard from cycling groups, taxi representatives and passenger advocates about access to the country's main urban rail stations.Glasgow Cathcart SNP MSP James Dornan, asked their views on the Queen Street plans.He said just now access for taxis was &quot;excellent&quot; at present but wondered what the standard would be after the work was complete.John Lauder National Director of sustainable transport group Sustrans said: &quot;We have concerns about the redeveloped station.&quot;It seems to be the role of Glasgow City Council to sort it out and no way of Network Rail to work with the council to work out how patrons get to the station.&quot;Looking at the plans we understand the interior constraints with extended platforms.&quot;He said plans for parking cycles was inadequate.He added: &quot;My big worry is there's a proposal for a shopping mall under the car park but no bicycle parking. We have shown where we think a bicycle park could go but we are back at square one.&quot;My worry with Queen Street is the plans are well developed and we are retro-fitting.&quot;Mr Lauder said a &quot;red Line&quot; was drawn around the station and all work was concentrated within that area and was concerned not enough consideration as given to the immediate surrounding areas for pedestrians and cyclists.Others said they would like to see greater integration of decision makers at an early stage in development discussions.George Mair Director of the Confederation of Passenger TransportScotland, said: &quot;We would like to see closer working between key partners in linking journeys up.The redevelopment is an almost rebuilding project with four extended towards the George Square entrance, which will have a full glass fronted facade.The extension of the Millennium Hotel will be demolished and the station connected with the extended Buchanan Galleries and a new car park built.The east side of the station, currently occupied by the taxi rank, car park and British Transport police office will be home to new station facilities, and retail and catering units on ground and upper levels.

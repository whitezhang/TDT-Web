THE axed President of an Orange Order band has escaped jail for sexually attacking two women after a night at an Orange Hall in Coatbridge.John Grimason, 35, of Tweed Street, Coatbridge, was convicted last month after a two-day trial at Airdrie Sheriff Court of sex attacks on two women.Defence lawyer Mark Lutton told the court: &quot;Custody would be devastating for his family. It is almost certain that he will lose his job as a result of this conviction. He is currently suspended from his job. If he is to avoid custody he will learn from this experience. He has been assessed as low risk and minimal that he will re-offend.&quot;Sheriff Scott Pattison told him: &quot;You may have friends and family in court but I have no doubt you did these things.&quot;I have no doubt, not a reasonable doubt. By a margin I am satisfied I can deal with this by way of a non-custodial sentence, but it is going to be onerous and will take longer than any prison sentence.&quot;Grimason, a first offender, was put on a three years community payback order, including supervision, 300 hours of unpaid work and a six months tagging order, which requires him to be at home every evening from 7pm until 7am.He was also put on the Sex Offenders' Register for three years. In addition he was also ordered to pay each of his victims &pound;1500 in compensation.After hearing evidence in the witness box from both of the women, the sheriff convicted Grimason of both sordid attacks, which happened at different times on the same evening.Grimason, then President of the Prince of Orange Flute Band, who play, practise and march from the Orange Hall in Crichton Street, sexually assaulted one of the woman during a Bank Holiday social event at the club on May 4, 2014.He was found guilty of placing his hand underneath her trousers.On the same evening, after having accompanied another woman from the event in a taxi, he put his hands on her inner thighs and forcibly attempted to put his hands underneath her underwear. The attack happened in Whifflet Street, Coatbridge.It is understood he has been banned for life by the Prince of Orange Flute Band.

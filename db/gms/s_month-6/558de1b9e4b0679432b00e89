Nursery feeding and clothing its pupils after parents' plea for helpNURSERY staff have been helping to feed and clothe their pupils after parents admitted they were struggling.Bridgeton Family Learning Centre began a clothing rail as part of an environmental project with nursery tots.But it soon became clear that families in the east end community needed more support than they were receiving.Claire Wales, team leader at the centre, said: &quot;We are an Eco School and wanted to teach the children about recycling.&quot;We asked the parents if they would send in unwanted, nearly new clothing for our clothing rail - things that their children were too big for or not using.&quot;We had set that up in the parents' room, which is quite private and can be used without anyone seeing.&quot;People are often quite embarrassed to admit they can't afford clothing or that they need a bit of extra help.&quot;On the back of this, parents had mentioned to us in confidence they were struggling with money. From that we moved on to the food bank.&quot;We got in touch with the charity With Kids to ask for their support and they emailed us to say they had food hampers left over from Christmas that we could have.&quot;A total of six parents from the centre came to staff to say they were able to provide food for their children - but it meant they were going hungry.These parents were also struggling to pay their heating bills and said their houses were cold and they had to use jumpers and dressing gowns to keep themselves and their children warm.The nursery then went to food bank charity the Trussell Trust - and is now a voucher holder.In order to use Trussell Trust food banks people must be referred from another agency with a voucher for a food parcel.Claire added: &quot;We have a really good relationship with our parents. Often the families have been here for years and several generations of the family have lived in the area and know the nursery so we have strong relationships with them.&quot;That means they're comfortable talking to us.&quot;Myself and two of our teachers are voucher holders now and we hope that respectful environment will help parents keep trusting us.&quot;Claire said it is hard knowing that nursery pupils' families are struggling but it is vital the centre helps all it can.&quot;Everything we do links back into us being an Eco School, teaching the children about the world and how to look after one another.&quot;It's something we talk about in our nursery, money, how it's used and how people need to work so they can earn money - whether they are nursery staff like us or plumbers or cleaners.&quot;The children understand that not everyone is able to work and there are not always enough jobs for everybody.&quot;Claire added: &quot;It's not nice for us knowing that this is going on. Some families you think are fine and then they tell you they are struggling.&quot;It can be very difficult to hear but we treat everyong with total confidence and privacy. You can't make any assumptions - you just have to let them come to you and say they need help.&quot;This is sadly all part of growing up in Scotland and living in a big city.&quot;

FIRST Minister Nicola Sturgeon has hosted a special reception for Glasgow School of Art as part of her first visit to the United States.The event in the New York Public Library for Performing Arts in Lincoln Centre Plaza brought together around 200 key representatives of the business community, former art school students based in New York and Scots living in America.Professor Tom Inns, director of the art school, said: &quot;It was also an opportunity to share our plans for the response to the fire and the restoration programme for the Mackintosh Building.&quot;Ms Sturgeon described the Mack, as it is known, as an extraordinary building.She said: &quot;It is an architectural gem and the artistic heart of Glasgow. It was truly heartbreaking to see it in flames.&quot;It can and will be restored, and everything which can be done must be done to deliver this.&quot;That is why I hosted this reception in New York, partly to thank some of those in the US for their response and generosity to the Mackintosh Appeal, but also to help raise the profile of the appeal and in part celebrate the life of the Mackintosh building that heralded the birth of modernism.&quot;The recovery and restoration of the Mack will be a long-term process and the Scottish Government is fully committed to supporting this, through the expertise of our specialist staff at Historic Scotland as well as through continued funding support.&quot;However, it will be through the support of all of those who have a deep affinity for Glasgow School of Art and its great contributions to the art world that will ensure the legacy continues.&quot;The Mackintosh building was severely damaged by fire on May 23, 2014 but 90% of the building and 70% of its contents have been saved.Work is now underway to reinstate the fire ravaged building.Meanwhile, a cheeky chat show host compared the First Minster to Saddam Hussein during her appearance on the Daily Show.Jon Stewart made the remark while discussing the SNP's success in the May general election, winning 56 out of 59 seats.When Sturgeon joked that she had ordered an inquiry into why the SNP had not won Scotland's three other seats, he replied: &quot;What do you think you're Saddam Hussein or something?&quot;I mean 56 out of 59's pretty good.&quot;The SNP leader had been mistakenly billed as a comedian on the US Comedy Central show's website ahead of her appearance last night however she was quick to set the record straight.She told the presenter: &quot;You billed me on your website as a comedian - so you've raised all these expectations that I'm going to be funny.&quot;I'm a politician, and as you know, politicians are rarely very funny.&quot;Yesterday Ms Sturgeon addressed and audience of business leaders at Caledonian University's New York campus.Today Ms Sturgeon will visit Takoma Park School to share best practice with staff at the facility, focusing on school food and nutrition.It is the SNP leader's third day of a four-day trip to America where she is undertaking a series of events in New York and Washington.

CAMPAIGNERS have called for a ban on the purchase of sex in Scotland to help end human trafficking.
 Rhoda Grant MSP has submitted amendments to new human trafficking legislation claiming curbing the demand for prostitution is key to ending sex slavery. 
Mrs Grant has the backing of a number of organisations including the Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance, a frontline service helping victims.
The Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill Legislation has been backed by MSPs and could provide the most progressive legislation of its kind in Europe.
But a number of organisations, including the Women’s Support Project claim it is a “golden opportunity’’to make the purchase of sex illegal in a bid to reduce exploitation.
 Others, such as Amnesty, argue that conflating human trafficking and prostitution within one piece of legislation will not do justice to either issue. 
Mrs Grant’s amendments would criminalise the purchase of sex, decriminalise victims of commercial sexual exploitation, and provide support to women exiting prsotitution.
Mrs Grant said said the new legislation had her full support but insisted it go further.
She said:”Trafficking and exploitation of this kind are based on the basic principles of supply and demand, and we must tackle demand if we want to prevent vulnerable people being exploited in the first place.”
Last week the purchase of sex was criminalised in Northern Ireland and Mrs Grant fears that if Scotland doesn’t follow suit, it will become “ a haven” for traffickers.
 “I understand the concern of fellow MSPs that this Bill is not the right vehicle for legislation as prostitution goes further than just trafficking. My question is to them; if not here then where? 
“I acknowledge that not all people involved prostitution are trafficked and that not all trafficking victims are being victims of sexual exploitation, but there is a clear, undeniable link, and it is clear to me that prostitution is a form of exploitation.”

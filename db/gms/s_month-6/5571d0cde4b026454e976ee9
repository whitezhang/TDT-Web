POLICE officers are to be interviewed over the death of a man in custody a month ago.
Father-of-two Sheku Bayoh, 31, died a short time after a struggle while he was being arrested.
The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner will now speak to officers who were involved.
Sheku’s family say they still don’t know the truth about how he died.
 

And they have questioned why no officers have been suspended while the inquiry takes place.
 The Scottish Police Federation said Sheku died after officers responded to a call of a man  brandishing a knife in his home town of Kirkcaldy on May 3. 
They also said a female officer was injured during the incident.

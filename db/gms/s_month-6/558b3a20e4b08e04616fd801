Waiting for Video...
A SHORT video of Danny MacAskill’s latest trip into Glasgow city centre has been posted on the stunt cyclist’s Facebook page, which has been received with unanimous enthusiasm online – but not by the people who were actually there. 
The clip shows some rather unimpressed bystanders ignoring MacAskill as he hopped across treachorous-looking walls and railings in Scotland’s largest city.
But he did at least find one admirer – after spotting him jumping from a wall, an elderly lady said he was “very brave”. 
Aww.

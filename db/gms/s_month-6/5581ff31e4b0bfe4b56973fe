POLICE Scotland have appealed for help to trace two teenage girls who have gone missing from a unit at Stobhill Hospital in north Glasgow.
Lilly McLaughlin-Clear, aged 14, originally from Castle Douglas, and Nicole Crossley, 16, originally from Gartcosh, North Lanarkshire, were last seen at 4pm on Tuesday in Springburn Park.
But the two were captured on CCTV footage taken in Edinburgh on Tuesday night.
Inspector Craig Walker from Maryhill Police Office said today:
“The girls were out in Springburn Park when they made off from staff around 4pm.
“Both are known to visit Sprinburn and Glasgow city centre and enquiries are ongoing in those areas to try and trace both girls.
“Officers have been able to establish that the girls stayed at a youth hostel in Edinburgh city centre last night and then withdrew money from a cash machine in Princes Street at 10.00 hours today.
“We are continuing to work with our colleagues in Edinburgh to see if they are still in the area however it is also possible that they have travelled elsewhere and so I would urge everyone to keep an eye out and let us know immediately if they think they may have seen Lilly or Nicole.”
Meanwhile, two teenage sisters who were reported missing from Inverness have been found safe and well.
Kamila Michalowicz, 15, and 14-year-old Natalia were traced in the Highlands area, Police Scotland said on social media.

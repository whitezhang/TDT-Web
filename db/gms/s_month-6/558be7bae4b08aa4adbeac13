Nicola Sturgeon warning to cybernats: you could be disciplined by the partyNicola Sturgeon has warned so-called &quot;cybernats&quot; who post abuse online that they could be disciplined by the party.The Scottish First Minister said it is &quot;not acceptable&quot; for people to use social media to &quot;threaten violence, or hurl vile abuse, or seek to silence the voice of others through intimidation&quot;.If SNP members &quot;cross the line&quot; in their posts, she said the party will take action.Writing in the Daily Mail, Ms Sturgeon pledged: &quot;When tweets or postings from SNP members that cross the line are brought to our attention, we will act - as we have done before.&quot;That is why I am making clear today that the SNP will take steps to warn those whose behaviour falls short of the standards we expect.&quot;We will tell them to raise their standards of debate, to stick to issues not personalities, and to ensure robust and passionate debate takes precedence over abuse and intemperate language.&quot;I am also making clear that where appropriate we will take disciplinary action. In the SNP we have a code of conduct and online guidance for our members.&quot;Where that code is broken, members should have no doubt that we will use our disciplinary processes.&quot;Ms Sturgeon, who has some 229,000 followers on Twitter, said the level of abuse she receives on social media &quot;would make people's hair stand on end were they to see it&quot;.She added: &quot;I choose simply to ignore it, but that doesn't mean that online comments which cross the line of decency are acceptable.&quot;Where political disagreement is passionate, open, honest and robust and conducted with respect, it is welcome. Even where views are expressed using language that I wouldn't use, I accept that - after all that's in the nature of free speech.&quot;But where people use Twitter to threaten violence, or hurl vile abuse, or seek to silence the voice of others through intimidation, that is not acceptable - and we must all say so loudly and clearly.&quot;She also urged other political leaders to follow her example, saying: &quot;We must send out a clear message that politics in Scotland will not be sullied by this behaviour.&quot;Raising the standard of debate is a responsibility across the board and I urge all parties to do as we have done - to say clearly that crossing the line will not be tolerated.&quot;

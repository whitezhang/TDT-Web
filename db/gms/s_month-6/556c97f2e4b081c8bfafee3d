STEWART PATERSONTHE views of the SFA must be considered before any UK Government action is taken over concerns that corruption led to the World Cup being awarded to Russia then Qatar according to a Glasgow MP.Stewart McDonald, whose Glasgow South constituency includes Hampden Park, called on the UK government to ensure it spoke not only to the English Football Association, but also the SFA and their counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland.The concerns arose after Sepp Blatter was re-elected president of FIFA despite arrests by the Swiss Government on behalf of US prosecutors and fresh criminal proceeds into corruption during World Cup bidding and voting processes.The call comes as the SFA issued a statement saying the match between Scotland and Qatar this week must be separated from concerns about human rights and safety of migrant workers building stadia for the 2022 World Cup in the Middle East country.In the House of Commons, UK Culture Media and Sport secretary John Whittingdale said that FIFA president Sepp Blatter's credibility was &quot;destroyed&quot; following the arrests.He said: &quot;I have just spoken to FA chairman Greg Dyke we stand behind the English FA's efforts to end the culture of kickbacks and corruption.&quot;Mr McDonald wanted to ensure the views of fans and administrators across the UK were considered before any action was taken.He said: &quot;I know the SFA and the FA are looking to work though Uefa to address governance concerns.&quot;He asked if the SFA's views would be sought before any action was taken by the government and if the Scottish Government would be kept informed.Mr Whittingdale said all four home nations had a part to play and that as far as he was aware they were united in their opposition to Sepp Blatter.He said he was sure the English FA was in touch with them and that he was happy to speak to his counterparts in the Scottish Government.In a separate statement the SFA said the match on Friday against Qatar at Easter road in Edinburgh was a different matter from the human rights issues, amid call for it to be cancelled or boycotted by fans.It stated: &quot;It is important to separate this sporting fixture from the serious human rights issues emanating from Qatar. The game was agreed with the national coach's wish for a competitive fixture as part of preparations for the forthcoming European Qualifier against Republic of Ireland as of paramount importance.It added: &quot;None the less, we are also cognisant of disturbing reports on the conditions experienced by migrant workers involved in the building of stadia for the forthcoming FIFA World Cup in 2022.&quot;For the avoidance of doubt, the Scottish FA condemns any behaviour that compromises human rights and, in conjunction with the Scottish Government, we have already stated our joint offer to provide practical support.&quot;

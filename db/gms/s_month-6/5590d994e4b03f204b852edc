Poorer kids twice as likely to struggle with reading and speakingCHILDREN from poorer families are twice as likely to struggle with speaking and writing, a new report has revealed.Youngsters from more deprived areas in Scotland are starting school with difficulties in language and literacy, with experts now calling for urgent preventative action.The report issued by the Read On, Get On campaign states poorer kids as young as three years old are struggling with speaking and writing, with their difficulties continuing as they start primary school.Authors say the problems continue to affect them into adulthood, which has &quot;serious knock-on effects for their future prospects.&quot;Those with difficulty in reading and speaking are half as likely to get the qualifications they need to go on to further study, or do well in the workplace.The campaign group, dedicated to getting more kids to read, is made up of reading agencies and children's charities including Save the Children.Representatives are now calling for more investment to be made to provide specialist support in language and communication.They also claim Scotland has made little progress in closing the achievement gap between rich and poor children.Professor Sue Ellis, Chairwoman of the Read On, Get On Campaign said: &quot;We want all young children to have strong language skills by the time they start school - it is the biggest educational issue that Scotland’s young children face in terms of development.&quot;Being behind in language will affect children’s learning, their social skills and their life chances.&quot;The group has also called for more support for parents from health visitors and other frontline staff, who can emphasise the importance of promoting early language.They have also called for measures to be brought in to track young children's progress at set milestones from birth to starting school.Neil Mathers, spokesperson for the campaign said: “The early years are the ‘golden years’ for supporting child development, especially where language is concerned.&quot;Too many of our poorest children are behind at age five.&quot;If we don’t do more to help all children develop strong language skills by the time they start school, this is the sticking point that could jeopardise the Scottish Government’s own goals on closing the attainment gap in schools.&quot;But with the right support from the start, children can overcome the impact of poverty.&quot;Scottish children’s reading skills have declined since 2012, which shows there is a real need to focus on getting it right.&quot;The good news is that we can make a difference. We know there’s a way and we know there’s the political will to make it work.&quot;

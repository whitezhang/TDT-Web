 Clyde have scrapped their youth academy, blaming a reduction in funding from the Scottish FA. 
 The League Two club said it was a result of their review of the SFA Club Academy Scotland (CAS) model for youth development. 
 Clyde had entered teams at Under-11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 17 levels. 
 &quot;The club has reluctantly concluded that it will not participate in competitive youth football, within Club Academy Scotland,&quot; said a statement. 
 &quot;With decreasing grant funding coming from the SFA for community clubs, the significant resources required to comply with CAS participation and the governing body's commitment to elite player development, Clyde FC has reluctantly concluded that the finance and resources necessary to operate within the CAS model cannot be sustained while it occupies the lower tiers of the Scottish game.&quot; 
 Clyde finished sixth, outside the promotion play-off places, during former Rangers and Scotland midfielder Barry Ferguson's first season as manager. 
 Willie O'Neill last month stood down as director of youth development of the Cumbernauld club. 
 &quot;Parents of all youth academy players are currently being informed of the decision and being advised that the boys are free to find new clubs ahead of their contract expiry on 30th June 2015,&quot; added the club statement. 
 &quot;Clyde FC has also agreed to assist with this process.&quot; 
 Clyde's Under-20 side, which is not part of Club Academy Scotland, is not affected as it is part of the first-team structure.

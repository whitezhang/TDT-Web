A WARD at a hospital which cares for the elderly has been closed by Glasgow's health board.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has shut the Islay ward at Drumchapel hospital, which offers long-term care for elderly patients.Some families have raised concerns about relatives who were settled in Drumchapel being moved elsewhere including Gartnavel hospital.The board said the beds were 'no longer required' because it had reduced the number of patients waiting to be discharged from the hospital.It said that a new rehabiliation ward for the elderly has been opened at Gartnavel General.Health boards are under pressure to tackle the problem of delayed discharges, also known as 'bed blocking'.Current targets for delayed discharges state nobody should wait more than four weeks from when they are clinically ready to be discharged, with that target set to come down to two weeks in April.A spokeswoman for NHSGGC said: &quot;Over the last year we have been working closely with our local authority partners to significantly reduce the number of people who are waiting to be discharge from hospital.&quot;Islay Ward was being used predominantly for patients who were awaiting discharge and by reducing the number of patients waiting to be either discharged home or into an appropriate care setting the beds in this ward are no longer required.&quot;At the end of last week only four patients remained in Islay Ward awaiting discharge so, in order to increase our rehabilitation capacity, we took the decision to move those patients to other beds within Drumchapel Hospital and open a new older people's rehabilitation ward at Gartnavel General.&quot;Earlier this year Health Secretary Shona Robison announced an extra &pound;200 million over two years to support new NHS and social care partnerships to help integrate services.Ms Robison said evidence on the ground indicates progress is being made and delayed discharges are starting to come down.

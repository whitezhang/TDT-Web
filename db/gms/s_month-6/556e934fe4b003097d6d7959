EVENING Times reporter Caroline Wilson began her career on a magazine close to where she lived in Lochaber.Her first major interview was with Charles Kennedy the leader of the Lib Dems in 2001.HE was my first real interview as a rookie reporter.I was at home, in Lochaber, putting together my portfolio for a postgraduate course in journalism.I'm sure getting a chat with the Liberal Democrat leader in his house did my application no harm at all.I was writing for a local magazine called Lochaber Life and the owners, Margaret and John Muncie, knew him well.It was just after Christmas and I'm sure he was relishing a break from frontline politics but he was only too happy to agree.I was nervous but needn't have been. I'm sure he knew I wasn't going to do a 'Paxman' on him.Off I went with my list of questions and the editor dropped me off at his modest bungalow in Inverlochy, close to his parents home.I remember he was watching the movie Ghostbusters when I arrived.It seemed rude to interrupt but the TV was hastily turned off and tea was immediately offered.He told me he had originally wanted to be a journalist, before his obvious skills as a debator at Glasgow University took his career in another direction to Westminster.It was around the time of the war in Iraq and I remember him asking me what I thought of Tony Blair.He seemed genuinely interested in my answer to this and other issues.He spoke of his passion for university education and the absolute necessity of funding for students and remained true to his principles through the years.I had no clear political persuasion when I arrived that day but he was a persuasive debator and I voted liberal democrat on at least one occasion after that interview.Growing up in Lochaber, there was a pride among locals - and a protective arm - that a local boy had become the youngest MP in parliament and now led his party.I felt genuinely saddened to hear of his death yesterday as will others from his hometown of Fort William. He put the area on the map and couldn't have given me a more positive start to my career in journalism.

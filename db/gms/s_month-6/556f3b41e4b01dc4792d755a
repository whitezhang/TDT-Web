THE case of a musician in Glasgow facing deportation to the United States has been raised with the Prime Minister.Steve Forman who works at the Royal Conservatoire and who has played with David Bowie and Pink Floyd during his career as a session drummer has been denied a work visa.As reported in the Evening Times previously, Mr Forman has been denied a visa because under the UK rules his current salary is deemed too low to allow him to remain.Glasgow North SNP MP Patrick Grady asked David Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons if he would intervene and if he could tell him why people like Mr Forman &quot;don't seem to be welcome in the country.&quot;Mr Cameron said he was not aware of the case but said he would &quot;look at it after PMQs and see what I can do&quot;.

CAMPAIGNERS have attacked a decision by the Home Office to deport a Glasgow college student to Pakistan.National student body NUS Scotland spoke out after City of Glasgow College student Majid Ali was flown back to his home country last night.Majid claimed his family have been persecuted for their political activities in his home province of Balochistan, in the south west of the country.Gordon Maloney, president of NUS Scotland, said the Home Office &quot;may well have just sent a young man to his death&quot;.He added: &quot;This is a devastating outcome for Majid, and those who have rallied to his defence in recent days.&quot;This shows the shocking callousness of our immigration system, and the urgent need for a complete overhaul of our asylum processes.&quot;This country has more than enough to provide for those who need it, and it is simply unacceptable for our Government to act with such a reckless disregard for human life.&quot;Majid first claimed asylum in the UK in 2011 after stating his brother was the victim of an enforced &quot;disappearance&quot; by Pakistani authorities. Ali also claimed his family home was raided and his uncle and cousin killed two months ago.Chris Stephens, SNP MP for Glasgow South West, wrote to the Home Office seeking an urgent review of the case and also laid down a motion in the House of Commons. Students also staged demonstrations at the Scotland Office in Edinburgh and the Home Office in London.Mr Stephens said: &quot;It is fairly obvious to anyone looking at this case that Majid should be allowed to stay as there would be a genuine fear for his life if he was deported.&quot;The student community, and the Baloch community here in Scotland, will not be ignored, and I join the demands to end the disgraceful and unfair way in which those seeking sanctuary in the UK are treated.&quot;Ali was a student activist in the troubled region before leaving for Scotland and his legal team have claimed he believes his life could be in danger if he were to return.Activists in the south-west region have long demanded greater autonomy, a larger share of the area's vast natural resources, and even full independence from Pakistan.Several separatist groups are considered terrorist organisations by Pakistan although there is no suggestion Ali had any association with such groups.

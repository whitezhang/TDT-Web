DAVE KING insists he won't tell Rangers fans whether to buy official merchandise from the club or not as many customers continue to boycott Sports Direct.Supporters have refused to hand over their cash for Rangers branded goods in recent months in protest at the controversial agreement struck between Mike Ashley and the former Ibrox regime.The Gers hierarchy have held talks with representatives from Sports Direct over the arrangement as they look to strike a better deal for the club.Replica kits for the 2015/16 season have already been launched but many fans are set to once again hold on to their cash.Mr King was speaking as he launched season tickets for the new campaign and the chairman is keen for fans to invest in the club in that way as the board continue their rebuilding job on and off the park.He said: &quot;It's an individual situation. The supporters must make their minds up and from that point of view it is necessary to have the discussions with Sports Direct to try to understand the arrangements because quite frankly, I don't understand much of it.&quot;Until I am in a position to take a more informed view of the value of the deal to the club, I won't encourage the fans one way or another.&quot;Season tickets? I know exactly where the money is going to go, so I am certainly going to encourage them to support us by buying them.&quot;Rangers will hold a General Meeting at Ibrox on Friday after Ashley posed several questions over the repayment of the &pound;5million loan he agreed with the old board at the turn of the year and Rangers International Football Club plc's delisting from the AIM stock exchange.The board are confident the Ashley cash does not have to be paid back as a matter of urgency even if shareholders pass the motion put forward by the Newcastle United chief.Mr King said: &quot;I don't see the Ashley loan being a loan in isolation. In fact, I don't see it as a loan, quite frankly.&quot;It is one of those situations we will certainly discuss with them. But I don't think the club should be repaying the loan.&quot;If we have to, we will. But I'd much rather see funds going into the club, rather than repaying that loan.&quot;That's part of the broader commercial discussion we will have with them. One way or another, we will cater for it.&quot;It is an interest free loan, it is free capital for the club and I think it should stay on that basis.&quot;

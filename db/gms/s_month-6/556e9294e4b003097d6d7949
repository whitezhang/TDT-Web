BUSINESSES have been urged to sign up to be a Living Wage employer to help lift people out of poverty.The majority of children experiencing poverty are from a home with at least on working adult, leading to calls for fairer wages to allow a better standard of living.Roseanna Cunningham, Fair Work Secretary, is hosting a Living Wage summit today as the Scottish Government becomes an accredited employer.First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, encouraged others to follow the Scottish Government and help the campaign reach its target of 500 Living Wage employers by next March.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;&quot;We have been working closely with the Poverty Alliance to encourage employers across Scotland to pay the Living Wage and to seek formal accreditation for doing so. There are now over 200 Scots-based employers who proudly display the Living Wage Employer Mark.&quot;The Scottish Government has been paying all its staff above the level of the Living Wage for some time but now we are happy to say that we are amongst the number of officially accredited employers - a step which further demonstrates our commitment to payment of the Living Wage in Scotland.&quot;She said research showed paying the living wage resulted in enhanced productivity, reduced absenteeism and better staff morale, providing business and staff benefits.Campaigners welcomed the Scottish government to the 200 employers who pay at least the &pound;7.85 an hour Living Wage rate and encourage others they deal with to do the same.The Scottish Government doesn't insist suppliers and contractors pay the Living Wage as it says there would be EU rules preventing it.Peter Kelly, Director of the Poverty Alliance, said: &quot;With almost two thirds of children in poverty in Scotland living in a household where someone works, it is now more important than ever that people are adequately remunerated for their labour.&quot;I hope that other organisations will follow in the Scottish Government's footsteps and sign up to the Scottish Living Wage Accreditation Initiative.&quot;It is hoped that with the Scottish Government receiving accreditation others will aspire to the same status.Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation said: &quot;Such a high profile announcement will no doubt drive interest, and we hope, encourage more businesses and organisations to also consider becoming Living Wage employers. The Living Wage isn't only the right thing to do it also makes good business sense.&quot;He said the best employers were signing up voluntarily to pay the higher rate.

PHILL Jupitus has hit out at Edinburgh’s Festival Fringe for being simply unaffordable.
The stand up comedian, poet and artist has three shows at this year’s festival and is something of a veteran having performed at the festival for nine years, but he admits its getting increasingly pricey for the ordinary punter.
The Never Mind The Buzzcocks team captain who will play Porky the Poet in Apologist at the Liquid Rooms Annexe, as well as appear at the National Portrait Gallery to draw on his iPad each morning - both for Free Fringe - alongside paid show Impossible at the Dome, said: “I like to do at least one free show so people can come and see me in it without breaking the bank.
&quot;I’ve noticed we have more Scots coming to those shows. If you live in Scotland and you are on an average wage and some shows cost twenty quid to get into and you take you and the kids and your missus to the show then it’s eighty quid which is then simply unaffordable.”
Phill, 52, added: “The Free Fringe is great for Edinburgh resident who have bought into it and they can go and see some great stuff.

&quot;One guy won the comedy award so it’s not like it’s bad quality stuff.”
Phill doesn’t believe doing a free show necessarily means that the performers will suffer for their art - as he believes free shows can be performed in tandem with other performances. He explained: “If you have enjoyed the show you rattle a bucket at the end and if anyone wants to buy me a pint I’ll be at the back.”
 The Edinburgh Fringe Festival returns on August 7-31, and this year’s programme features over 3,000 events.

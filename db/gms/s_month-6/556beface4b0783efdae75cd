A NHS job advert which stated that low-paid health workers must deal with daily complaints from "irate" surgeons has been dismissed as a "practical joke".NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde say that the job description - which left existing staff horrified - slipped through HR checks.The vacancy for a theatre nursing support worker at Gartnavel General Hospital, which has a starting salary of &pound;15,358, says that applicants face daily exposure to &quot;complaints from irate surgeons due to the pressures and constraints of the environment&quot;.A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: &quot;Clearly, this is a job description that appears to be written as a practical joke and unfortunately has slipped through our HR checks before being posted.&quot;One angry worker told the Evening Times: &quot;This really isn't funny. I am horrified that someone would seek to make fun of lower paid workers being subjected to verbal abuse.&quot;The vacancy has caused outcry among staff.The NHS staff member said: &quot;There are posters hanging around the hospital stating that we wont accept verbal or physical abuse from patients, but this job description was telling us we should not only expect this from surgeons but that we will also sign a contract agreeing to it.&quot;The worker added: &quot;Consultants are renowned for their &quot;nippiness&quot; especially in the theatre setting.&quot;I think a lot of the pressures arise from government targets that are impossible to meet; therefore the hospitals in general are under pressure to get an increasing number of patients through the system without the staff to cope with the demand.&quot;However some consultants believe they are above the rest of the staff and feel &quot;us lowly staff members are not worthy of any respect&quot; and this job description appeared to give them free rein to abuse staff with no repercussions.&quot;Despite the wording of the advert, it is understood that 61 people have applied for the 37.5 hour a week post which requires staff work night shifts and weekends.Clinical support workers provide specialist care to patients undergoing surgery.They also prepare, maintain and clean the operating theatre.The job advert also states they risk exposure to &quot;verbal and physical aggressive behaviour from patients&quot; who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol or anaesthetic, bodily fluids, airborne and blood borne viruses and hazardous fumes.A NHS GGC spokesman added: &quot;Thanks for bringing this to our attention.&quot;The advert has now been removed.&quot;The

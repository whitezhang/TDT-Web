Bogus callers claiming to be from "water board" target people in GlasgowBOGUS callers claiming be from the water board are continuing to target people in Glasgow.In the latest incident a conman tried to gain access to a house in Mansewood in the south of the city yesterday.It is understood he was not let inside.This comes just three days after an elderly couple from Maryhill were robbed of cash when a man who said he worked for Scottish Water entered their Knowetap Street home.Also on Monday, a group of men wearing high-visibility jackets with the word “water” on the back were reported to be loitering in the Boclair Avenue area of Bearsden.Scottish Water is urging all customers in the Glasgow area to be aware of bogus callers.They are advising people to follow their &quot;Three C's&quot; rule - ask for a card; check identity; and call Scottish Water - when approached by someone who says they are from the company.Joanna Peebles, Scottish Water’s regional communities team manager, said: &quot;All our employees carry identity cards, which they are more than happy to show when requested to do so. Householders shouldn’t let anyone into their home until they are sure of their identity.&quot;Check through the peep hole on your door; ask them to pass their ID card or letter through the letter box. Our employees will be more than happy to wait while you check their identity.&quot;On occasion, when we need access to a customer’s property we normally try to contact them in advance and arrange a suitable time.&quot;However, there may be occasions when we need to cold-call. But all our employees carry ID badges and are happy to display these on arrival. &quot;Our staff and contractors never call at a customer’s home to collect money.&quot;In a bid to help protect customers against bogus callers, Scottish Water is again offering an Anti-Bogus Caller Pack which contains a personal electronic alarm, window sensor, door viewer, UV marker pen and guard bar.For more information visit www.scottishwater.co.uk/boguscaller and www.scotland.police.uk/keep-safe .

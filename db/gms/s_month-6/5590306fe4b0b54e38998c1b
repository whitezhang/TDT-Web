"Adored" dinner lady who served for almost 30 years to retireTHOUSANDS of pupils across Scotland have tossed their uniforms far back into the depths of their wardrobe and placed their books firmly under their bed, as school is officially out for summer.But come August when Bannerman High School is once again filled with a sea of purple and black blazers, there will be one noticeable difference as for the first time in almost 30 years “everybody’s favourite” dinner lady won’t be behind the counter.Despite receiving a medal of service just four years ago for an outstanding 25 years at the school, the “legend of Bannerman High,” Katherine Young, has decided to hang up her apron and enter the world of retirement leaving behind a devastated body of staff and more than 1300 adoring pupils – of whom she knows “almost all” of their names.While many people long for the day they can say goodbye to their working lives forever, Katherine admits she doesn’t know what she’ll do with herself without her second family around.The 65-year-old said: “I will miss it terribly, I feel like I’m just going on holiday and I’ll come back at some point.“I can’t believe I’m going it feels like this is happening to someone else.“It is very overwhelming, everyone is making such a fuss.”And it was a fuss indeed, on Tuesday more than a dozen of Katherine’s colleagues, friends and pupils gathered to wish their beloved dinner lady a fond farewell.Katherine was showered with flowers, jewellery and cards galore but the Baillieston native simply cannot comprehend why everyone felt she deserved such a spectacular send off.The answer lies with those who attended, including colleague and long-time friend Joyce Currie, who organised the event for the star dinner woman she was worked with for more than 21 years.The 51-year-old said: “I have worked with her for over 20 years and I have never seen her in a bad mood.“She looks after us all, every morning she has tea waiting for you coming in and she always checks me to make sure I have had something to eat – she is just the mammy.“She’s got time for everyone, such a loyal, loyal person.“I don’t know how she does it, she remembers everything and always pay attention – if your kid is ill she’ll never forget to ask how they are.“It’s things like that that make her so loved.“I shudder to think about coming back without her – I’m trying not to think about it.”Joyce is not the only one who is dreading to make the return to the high school next term - her sister, Anita Kirkpatrick, also a dinner lady at Bannerman High, “cannot imagine the place without her”.The 41-year-old has worked with Katherine for around ten years but has known her for even longer – as Katherine was Anita’s favourite dinner lady when she was at school.Anita said: “She’s been here for 29 years – she’s part of the place.“She was my favourite when I was at school, every day I had the same lunch – coleslaw and chips – and she would always keep it for me, she was just brilliant.“And she is the exact same now, working with her is just brilliant.“I’m dreading it without her – it will be so, so quiet.“She’s always singing, dancing and laughing.”Both Anita’s son and Joyce’s daughter, who were served their school lunches by Katherine, made a special appearance to say goodbye to the woman who made their lunchtimes memorable.Katherine said: “I see a lot of people who I’ve served them and then their kids come in but I didn’t expect any of them to come back to say goodbye.“It’s all very overwhelming, that’s the only word I can think of to describe any of this – it’s just all so overwhelming.“It’s lovely that the kids even remember me from when they were at school now that they are grown up.“I have loved it here – every day has been a highlight for me.“I can’t believe it’s been 29 years.“I only wish I was younger and I would still be here.“I’m in two minds about leaving, it has come so quickly.”And that is clear, when Katherine’s friends, family, pupils and colleagues wish her a happy retirement her eyes well as she says “It’s such a final word, retirement” only to be met with a chorus of “You deserve it, Kathy”.But don’t expect not to see the dinner lady around Bannerman High School next term.She said: “I’ll be in every Friday for my tea, they won’t get rid of me yet.”

Read all about it: kids urged to take part in summer library challengeAWARD-WINNING children’s authors are turning the first page on Glasgow's summer reading challenge.Alex McCall and Glasgow-based author and illustrator Alison Murray are urging children aged five to 12 to join the library and read six books during the summer holidays.Alex, whose book Attack of the Giant Robot Chickens, won the prestigious Scottish Children’s Book Award for younger readers, is one of Scotland’s youngest authors.He said: “I’m thrilled to support the launch of the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland. It was an initiative like this that got me interested in reading to begin with.&quot;As such, I know just what a positive impact it can have on young people.”Run by charity The Reading Agency, in partnership with Glasgow Life library services and Tesco Bank, the Challenge aims to keep children reading during school holidays - a time when literacy skills can dip.This year’s theme - Record Breakers - invites children to discover some of the astonishing real-life achievements and world records featured in the Guinness World Records Books.Collecting stickers as they go, young readers will discover weird, wonderful and wacky records from around the world in six different categories: Cool Tech, Way to Go, The Big Stuff, Animal Magic, People Power and Action, Adventure.Alison added: “I’ve spent many a rainy Glasgow summer’s day with my daughter in our local library, and been incredibly thankful for it.“No matter what the weather, reading can take you on an exciting adventure from the comfort of an armchair. As well as this, the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland invites you to use and support your local library, a hugely valuable community asset.”Since 2011, the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland has been drawing children into their local libraries and inspiring them to read for pleasure.It combines free access to books with fun social activities and a creative online element.Last year, more than 2,300 young people across Glasgow took part in the initiative and this year libraries across the city will be hosting an array of exciting events and activities to help even more youngsters engage in the programme.Free Record Breakers activities will be delivered in libraries across Glasgow, including innovative storytelling events, action-packed workshops and craft sessions, with library staff on hand to support children, helping them to discover new authors and explore a wide range of different types of books.Children can borrow books from any of Glasgow’s 32 community libraries, and the Mitchell Library, by signing up for a free Glasgow Library card or Kidz Card at their local library.Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, said: “A love of reading, and an enthusiasm for engaging with our libraries, is one of the greatest gifts we can give our children.“The Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland is a fantastic initiative that enables us to nurture important reading skills, which will stand our children in good stead throughout their lives.“Libraries are very often at the heart of their communities, and this year each of our libraries will be creating fantastic opportunities for young people to engage with reading throughout the summer holidays.&quot;I would urge all young Glasgow residents to visit their local library to take part in this year’s challenge.”To find out more about Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge Scotland in your local library, visit: www.glasgowlife.org.uk/libraries

X FACTOR winner Sam Bailey can’t wait to perform at the Sunday Mail race night – and catch up with old pal Nicholas McDonald.
 Sam, 37, who won the 10th series of the show, will appear alongside fellow former contestant Jay  James on Saturday, July 11, at the Hamilton Park course. 
She’ll fly in straight from holiday and will use the visit to Scotland to meet up with Nicky, who she pipped to the X Factor title in 2013.
Sam said: “I’m really excited about coming to Scotland. I’m coming straight from my hols in Barbados.
 

“I’m not even going home – I am getting off the plane back from Barbados and getting a flight straight to Glasgow.”
She joked: “I will be all tanned up, refreshed and ready to go. I’m really looking forward to it.”
She told how she can’t wait to catch up with Nicholas, who is godfather to her daughter Miley.
Mum-of-three Sam added: “I’m really looking forward to seeing my Nicky noo-noo.
 

“I just love going to Scotland. Over the last few years, I have a friend who has got me into horseracing.
“My daughter has also just started doing horseriding – she’s doing jumps and all sorts. It can get really addictive – it’s great fun for her and great exercise.
“So, I’ll hopefully also pick up some tips and info for her when I’m at Hamilton. I can’t wait.”

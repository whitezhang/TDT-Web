A WARRANT for the arrest of Rangers captain Lee McCulloch was granted when he failed to make a court appearance.
The 37-year-old was expected at Glasgowâ€™s Justice of the Peace Court today to face a speeding charge.
But when he failed to appear in the dock before JP Alistair McLean he granted a warrant.
McCulloch, from Bothwell, is alleged to have been driving at 81mph in a 60mph zone on the M8 motorway.
Papers from the court claim the alleged offence took place on July 8, last year while driving a Mini countryman Cooper.
McCulloch, who has played for Motherwell and Wigan Athletic, has been with Rangers since 2007.
He has been captain since 2012.
During the match against Motherwell on May 31, McCulloch was hit in the face with a flag.
The incident happened midway through the first half when he went to the touchline to collect the ball.

LEAH SHEVLIN hit the town in Dubai last  night after her  footballer boyfriend Allan McGregor called off their wedding.
The couple were due to tie the knot this Saturday at the Mount Stuart Hotel on Bute but the Scotland goalie called a halt to plans after reportedly having  second thoughts.
And after a wellwisher told Leah, 32, she would look back on the experience one day and be grateful, she replied: “I’m thankful already.”
 

She later tweeted a hotel room selfie in a tight white lace bustier and matching skirt, captioned “Dubai Nights”.
McGregor, 33, who plays for Hull City, reportedly broke off the wedding after he and Leah jetted off on holiday to Dubai with their daughter, three-year-old Noelle Rose.

Thanking Twitter  followers who had sent her supportive messages, she posted: “Beautiful, genuine and decent people always outnumber the bad. Thank you to all those lovely people for your kind messages.”

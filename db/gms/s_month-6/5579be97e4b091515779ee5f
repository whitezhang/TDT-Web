The music being played was just a starter for what’s on the menu at the Glasgow Jazz Festival, which runs between June 24 and 28.
There’s a real treat for fans of traditional New Orlean’s jazz on Sunday, June 21, between 6pm and 8pm, when the Scottish legends that are Penman’s Jazzmen, who were formed in 1959, take to the stage at intu Braehead.
General manager for intu Braehead, Gary Turnbull said: “We’ve jazzed up our new food mall and built a stage for performers to entertain our diners.

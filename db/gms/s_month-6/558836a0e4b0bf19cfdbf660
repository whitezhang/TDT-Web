A TRAIN driver hailed a hero by Sir Richard Branson has received an award for his actions during a fatal accident in Cumbria.
Virgin Trains employee Iain Black, 54, was driving the Pendolino that derailed in 2007 due to a set of faulty points, killing one passenger.
Mr Black, from Dumbarton, West Dunbartonshire, took prompt action to alert rail controllers to the accident despite the fact he had a broken neck.
He was given a special contribution honour at the Scottish Transport Awards, a month after retiring from Virgin Trains.
Mr Black said: &quot;I was taken aback when the award was announced but it's a fantastic end to my career. It's a nice swansong to the 36 years I've had with the industry.&quot;
Margaret Masson, 84, from Cardonald, Glasgow, was killed and 22 others injured when the Glasgow-bound train derailed in remote countryside near Kendal.
 

Speaking back in 2007, Mr Black said the train was like a &quot;violent bucking bronco&quot; as its nine carriages hurtled off the tracks and down an embankment.
His neck was broken but despite being seriously injured he made a mobile phone call to his girlfriend, a manager with Virgin Trains, to help ensure all other trains on the line were stopped.
The awards ceremony in Glasgow last night heard that Mr Black &quot;is fondly known within the railway industry for his warmth, humour, generosity and the work he has done to help colleagues prepare for and support those involved in traumatic incidents.&quot;
A Virgin Trains spokesman said: &quot;We're really pleased to see Iain honoured at this awards ceremony for his outstanding contribution, which went far beyond the call of duty.
&quot;He acted with great professionalism and fortitude both during the derailment and in the years subsequently.
&quot;He is greatly admired and loved by colleagues, and we all wish him a long and happy retirement.&quot;

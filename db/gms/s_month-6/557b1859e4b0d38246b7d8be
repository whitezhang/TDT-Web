AN organisation based in the Merchant City has been selected to administer Scottish Power's new hardship fund.The company has committed initial funding of &pound;5.2million over the next two years to help some of its most vulnerable customers.Social Enterprise Direct, which is committed to creating sustainable employment and tackling hardship, has won the contract to administer the cash.To date it has created 13 new posts to support the administration of the fund with all the jobs filled by people who were either unemployed or on a work programme.Andrew Bartlett, chief executive and founder of Social Enterprise Direct, said: &quot;We are delighted Scottish Power has chosen us to administer their hardship fund.&quot;Our organisation is committed to delivering services that make a difference to people's lives and the Scottish Power Hardship Fund will make a real difference to real people.&quot;The fund has already had a positive impact on our organisation, allowing us to offer 13 people jobs. All of these people were either unemployed or on a work programme. As an accredited Living Wage Employer, we know these jobs transform lives.&quot;The hardship fund helps people with difficulty paying their bills due to low income get their energy bill payments under control.Householders who apply successfully have their gas and/or electricity arrears cleared or reduced.The first step is to contact a recognised debt advice agency such as National Debtline which will provide free, independent money and debt advice and advise on how to budget for energy payments on an ongoing basis.

Police launch summer crackdown on antisocial loutsBOOZED-UP thugs intent on causing misery in Glasgow are to be targeted as part of a police summer crackdown.Dedicated officers will be targeting antisocial behaviour, which tends to spike over the summer months.Detective Inspector Michael Miller said: &quot;Crime does not take a summer holiday.&quot;During the summer months, we sometimes see an increase in antisocial behaviour with noisy parties and underage drinking.&quot;Officers will be monitoring and visiting licensed premises to ensure compliance with the relevant legislation.&quot;If you’re tempted to buy alcohol for people who are underage, please be aware you’re committing an offence and you’ll probably find yourself at the attention of the police.&quot;Antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.&quot;Police Scotland launched its Summer Safety Campaign at James Hamilton Heritage Park, in East Kilbride, yesterday.As the school summer holidays get underway, youngsters have been urged to stay safe in rivers and lochs.Meanwhile, revellers are being encouraged to stay safe as they make their way home from a night on the town.DI Miller, from Police Scotland’s Safer Communities, said: &quot;Hopefully we’ll see some sunny weather.&quot;And with the lighter nights, people are more likely to be out and about later, perhaps having a few drinks.&quot;Please ensure if you’re out with friends you look after each other.&quot;Plan your route home, pre-book a taxi and make sure it’s from a reputable firm.As well as raising awareness among young people about online dangers, the campaign is urging parents to play a vital role in protecting their children.Officers are encouraging parents to speak to children about how to use the internet, as well as check what they are doing online.DI Miller added: &quot;For many, the summer holidays will be a time for relaxation and rest, with this weekend set to be one of the busiest of the year at airports and on the roads as people head off into sunnier climes.&quot;The summer holidays are no doubt a time which kids and parents alike really look forward to, and kids might find themselves spending more time online.&quot;We’d urge parents to monitor their kids’ online activity and check what they are accessing to keep them safe.&quot;Police Scotland's summer safety campaign will run for six weeks.

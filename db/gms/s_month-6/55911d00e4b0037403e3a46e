 DJ LEGEND Fatboy Slim will play an extra special T in the Park warm up gig in Glasgow , it has just been revealed. 
He’ll play the Sub Club venue on Thursday, July 9 as part of a pre-T party.
Festival organisers DF Concerts and Tennent’s Lager announced the gig tonight ahead of the festival which starts in Perth on July 10 for three days.
Fatboy Slim’s live shows are an explosive mix of his own brand of party house and complex audio-visual production.
Having last played the festival in 1999, he makes a long awaited return this year to play historic first day of T in the Park at its brand new home, Strathallan Castle.

To T-up his hotly anticipated set at Strathallan Castle, he’ll treat a very limited number of fans to an intimate set at Glasgow’s iconic Sub Club the night before he takes to the T in the Park stage, getting the party well and truly started.
Tickets are expected to be snapped up instantly, and T in the Park is offering its T Lady e-newsletter subscribers the first chance to get tickets via a limited pre-sale exclusively for T Lady subscribers from 6pm on Friday 26th June.
 General tickets will go on sale on Saturday 27th June at 12 noon via www.gigsinscotland.com and www.ticketmaster.co.uk

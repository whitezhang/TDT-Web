RAIL passengers turned to the roads this morning to avoid major engineering work on the Edinburgh to Glasgow line.
Commuters were facing the first Monday of the closure of the Winchburgh tunnel which means passengers have to use alternative routes and lengthy diversion.
But while the railways ran smoothly it seemed passengers turned to their cars with increased traffic on the motorway network being blamed on the railway work.
Traffic Scotland said increased congestion on the M9 at Edinburgh was down to the Winchburgh scheme and delays were also reported on the M80 and M8 heading into Glasgow.
The closure of the tunnel, near Linlithgow, will affect rail services until Monday July 27.

Work on the multi-million upgrade got underway on Saturday and it involves lowering the track in the tunnel to make room above for electric lines.
It’s part of the &pound;742 million Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP) which will see the line in the Glasgow’s Queen Street station electrified by 2016.
Some commuters took to social media this morning to highlight issues with the work.
On Twitter @Labourcat said: “Strangely empty train – has everyone opted to drive to work – M8 and Edinburgh ring round could be hideous #scotrail #winchburgh.”
And @rnnbrwn said: “So far, so good. Slow (and early) train to Edinburgh very quiet. Maybe everyone else has decided to drive. #scotrail #winchburgh.”
@AndrewMcIntyr16 said: “Credit to @ScotRail for day 1 of #Winchburgh works - revised timetables running very well and got in on time.”
And @aitchisonross said: “First Monday of #Winchburgh...slower commute than normal but no major disruption so far. Keep it up @ScotRail.”

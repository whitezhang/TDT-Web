Legendary rock outfit Gun have announced two new Scottish dates - and one of them is the perfect Christmas present for fans.
The boys - whose new album Frantic won rave reviews - will play Aberdeen’s Garage on October 9 as part of a UK headline tour.
Then they play a special festive one-off at the barrowlands, Glasgow on Friday, December 18 - the wildest night of the year, Black Friday.
Frontman Dante Gizzi said: “The last time we played the Barras it was amazing and with some great Scottish music venues facing closure - such as the Arches and now supposedly the ABC in Sauchiehall St - thank God we will still have the Barrowlands.
 

“It’s the best venue in Scotland and the fans are also the best. Let’s make this the maddest, baddest Black Friday”
The title track of the album, the brilliant Frantic, is released as a single on Monday (June 8) - so expect to be hearing plenty more of Gun in the coming weeks.
 Tickets for both shows are on-sale tomorrow (Weds June 3) from www.gunofficial.co.uk

Concern is growing for a 13-year-old East Kilbride girl who has been missing for three days.
Brogan Mearns was last seen at around 6pm on Saturday, June 6 at her dad's home on Tormusk Road in Castlemilk.
She told him she was going for a walk but never returned.
The East Mains teenager also went missing in April but was later found safe and well.
Brogan is described as 5ft 4, medium build, with blue eyes and black shoulder length hair.
She was last seen wearing blue skinny jeans and a purple hooded top.
Constable Stuart Adams said: “Brogan has gone missing before but we are all very concerned about her well-being particularly due to her age.
“I would appeal to anyone that recognises Brogan or knows where she is to contact police immediately.
“I would also encourage Brogan to let someone know that she is safe – she is not in any trouble we just want to know that she is safe.
“Anyone with information can contact police via the non-emergency number 101.”

LOOKING for your very own slice of Scottish paradise - look no further.
For &pound;375,000 you could purchase a three-bedroomed house, complete with 2,574 acres of unspoilt land and your very own private beach on the Isle of Lewis.
The Aird Bheag Estate, which boasts some of the most stunning scenery in Scotland, can be reached by boat, helicopter, or a lengthy hike.
Stretching across some of the most picturesque glens, lochs and beaches in the country, the house overlooks a private bay.
The estate, which is five times the size of the Olympic Park in London, can be bought for &pound;136 an acre.
In contrast, a seven-acre plot at Pacific Quay in Glasgow - which could fit into the estate almost 400 times, is on sale for &pound;30million.
Meanwhile, in Londonâ€™s SE7, &pound;375,000 would buy you a compact two-bedroomed flat marketed by estate agent Hamptons International, the Daily Mail reports.
Aird Bheag is owned by Rory Miller Mundy and his sister, who grew up on the stunning island retreat.
Their father Andrew, bought the estate in 1971 and set about bringing running water and electricity to that area of Lewis for the first time.

 St Mirren have confirmed that former player and manager Gary Teale has left the club by &quot;mutual consent&quot;. 
 The 36-year-old took charge in December following the dismissal of Tommy Craig, however could not save the Paisley side from relegation. 
 Former Dumbarton manager Ian Murray was appointed new boss last week as they prepare for the Scottish Championship. 
 &quot;I am disappointed not to continue my years at St Mirren Park,&quot; Teale told the official St Mirren&nbsp; website. 
 &quot;I leave behind a lot of good friends and wish Ian and the club every success in the future. 
 &quot;I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my time here as a player none more so than 17th March 2013 [St Mirren winning the League Cup] which was the highlight of my career.&quot; 
 The former Scotland international made 53 appearances for the club after signing in 2011, and was part of the side that defeated Hearts 3-2 to win the League Cup final at Hampden. 
 Chairman Stewart Gilmour said: &quot;The club wishes Gary every success in the future and, as has already been stated, Gary will be a good manager in years to come. 
 &quot;The club appreciate the situation that Gary was left in by taking over somebody else's squad and thank him for all of his dedication and hard work during the season. 
 &quot;Gary will always be remembered at St Mirren as one of the Cup-winning legends of 2013 and will always be a welcome visitor at St Mirren Park. 
 &quot;It has been a very difficult period for Gary but throughout this testing time he has conducted himself with dignity and professionalism.&quot;

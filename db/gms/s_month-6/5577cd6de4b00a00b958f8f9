HUNDREDS of South Lanarkshire college students have been warned of the dangers of posting sectarian material online.South Lanarkshire College in East Kilbride have teamed up with anti-sectarian campaigners, Nil by Mouth, to deliver a new hard-hitting ad campaign to warn of the legal ramifications of online bigotry.The campaign group, which was founded by Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year, Cara Henderson, warns youngsters that they could face a prison sentence of up to five years for posting sectarian and offensive messages online.More than 100 posters featuring the campaign's message have been displayed across the college's campus since January.The publication of the final report of the Scottish Government's Advisory on Sectarianism last month highlighted the growing problem of online sectarianism.Campaign director, Dave Scott, said: &quot;For better or worse people are spending more and more time online and, sadly, we are seeing people use the internet, and social media sites in particular, to spread hate and bigotry.&quot;We have been working with a number of offenders, victims and families over the past few years and what become very clear is that people do not think there is any consequences for abusing people online. It's also astonishing how many people use words they don't even understand.&quot;We want this campaign to hammer home to people the very real consequences of posting sectarian material online and hopefully it will encourage them to pause before they post.&quot;

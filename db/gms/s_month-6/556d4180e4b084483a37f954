There will also be cooking classes, expert advice and activities for children.Organisers described it as &quot;a fun-packed family day out, designed to educate and entertain in equal measure.&quot;Event director Tom Treverton said: &quot;It's incredibly exciting to launch the fourth edition of this phenomenal event.&quot;While growing the show in London, Liverpool and Berlin, we have been inundated with requests from members of the Scottish public for this event to head their way.&quot;The scale of public demand, combined with a tremendously positive response from producers in the maturing free-from market, meant Scotland was absolutely the right choice for our next show, with Glasgow's SECC providing the perfect venue to make it happen.&quot;Dan Thurlow, director of exhibition sales at SECC, said, &quot;This is an event we have been observing for a number of years and are thrilled to now have a deal with F2F Events to bring it to Glasgow.&quot;Given the increasing demand for free-from products and information in Scotland, this is a show that our region really wants, so it feels great to be hosting it for them at our venue.&quot;The show will take place on March 19 and 20.

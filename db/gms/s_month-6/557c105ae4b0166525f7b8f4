IRELAND’S preparations for tonight’s crunch Euro showdown in Dublin have been overshadowed by a second personal tragedy for talisman Robbie Keane.
The 34-year-old striker trained with his team-mates yesterday morning just hours after being told a second of his cousins had been killed by the same freak industrial accident. On Wednesday, Alan Harris died after being overcome by toxic fumes while working on a sewer system in the city. Yesterday, his brother Stephen passed away after losing a two-day battle for life in a Dublin hospital.

Irish boss Martin O’Neill admits his star man might not recover mentally in time to play the Scots. He said: “Robbie is quite down at the moment. I am hoping he will come round.
“Whether he feels he wants to participate in the game will be entirely his decision. But he is not great, not great at all.”

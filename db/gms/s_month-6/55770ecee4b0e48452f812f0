CELTIC were today given the go-ahead to install standing areas at Parkhead.&nbsp;The &quot;safe standing&quot; area could be open by the start of 2016/17 season, the club revealed today.It is proposed that the rail seating area will initially accommodate up to 2600 supporters.Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: &quot;Celtic has worked tirelessly on this issue and we are delighted that this permission has finally been granted&quot;.&quot;The introduction of rail seating at Celtic Park represents an investment in spectator safety.&quot;Across football globally, the reality is that some supporters are choosing to stand at matches.&quot;This is something we must accept and manage and also understand the positive effect which these areas have on atmosphere at matches&quot;.&quot;Celtic's primary objective will always be the safety and comfort of its supporters - this new system will now allow fans to stand safely at matches.&quot;Rail seating has been in place in European football for some time and there has been considerable demand for some form of &quot;safe standing&quot; within the UK and particularly from our supporters.&quot;We are sure the rail seating section will prove very popular with supporters and we look forward to its introduction.&quot;&quot;I would like to thank Glasgow City Council for their support in delivering this measure and for the backing they have given to Celtic's focus on safety at matches.&quot;Safety and Security expert Dr Steve Frosdick has been closely involved in Celtic's work in this area and in the application to Glasgow City Council.Steve added: &quot;This is a great day for the club and its fans. This is a pioneering move by Celtic and one which has spectator safety at its core&quot;.&quot;For the first time in the UK, football fans will be able to stand to watch the game from purpose-built accommodation which is demonstrably safe. The club and its fans are to be congratulated for the way they have worked together to make the case to the authorities. Glasgow City Council and the emergency services are also to be commended, firstly for their rigorous scrutiny of the proposal and secondly for having the courage to grant the first approval.&quot;&quot;Although standing up throughout the match has become increasingly common, persistent standing between rows of seats has been a concern for football clubs and the authorities. Clearly the club was keen to find a better way of safely accommodating those fans who wanted to stand&quot;.&quot;There was of course no question of going back to the standing terraces of old. However the new style rail seating found in Germany and Austria provides the solution the club was seeking. The seat folds away and each fan stands in their own designated space behind a waist-high rail&quot;.&quot;This is a system which has operated successfully in Europe for a number of years and I am convinced it is one which will prove to be highly successful and popular at Celtic Park.&quot;Councillor Gordon Matheson, Leader of Glasgow City Council, said: &quot;I'm delighted with the decision to approve safe standing at Celtic Park, and I congratulate the fans and Celtic FC for working with the council to get to this point.&quot;Fans are the lifeblood of football and should be celebrated and supported whenever possible.&quot;My administration has for some time been in favour in principle of safe-standing, and I am pleased that Glasgow is once again setting a precedent for the country with this bold decision.&quot;It is right that we have all taken our time to work through the details. Safety remains our top consideration and we will continue to work with the club to assure this.&quot;A spokesman for the council said: “Following detailed discussions with Celtic we are satisfied in principle with the club’s proposals for a safe standing area at Celtic Park.“Previously it was felt that a stewarding plan alone would not ensure spectator safety in the standing area.“But the introduction of appropriate barriers, widened gangways, along with the kind of rail seating often found in European grounds and other measures, will address those concerns.“The new standing area will be subject to on-going monitoring and evaluation to ensure spectator safety is being maintained.“Renewal of the safety certificate for the stadium will continue to be required on an annual basis.”

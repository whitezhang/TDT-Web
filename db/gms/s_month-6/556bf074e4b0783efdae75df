AN app launched by a city expert has topped the app store charts in over 40 countries.Buddhify allows people to meditate wherever they are and since its release has been used for more than 14million minutes.Rohan Gunatillake, director of Merchant City based Mindfulness Everywhere, is now about to release a set of 54 cards aimed at bringing awareness, calm and kindness to people wherever they are.It is being funded through a crowd funding Kickstarter campaign, which resulted in 1035 backers pledging almost &pound;35,000 in just six days - &pound;10,000 more than the original target.The campaign ends on June 10 and if it reaches &pound;40,000 Rohan has vowed to gift 100 sets to the Mental Health Foundation.Each of the Cards for Mindfulness features an inspirational idea or phrase on the front with a detailed matching exercise on the reverse.The cards are said to be a gentle way to bring mindfulness to life and can be placed anywhere around the home or office to prompt people, whatever they are doing.Rohan Gunatillake said: &quot;The cards are beautiful and the ideas and techniques you find on them contain the best of what we have learnt about how to express mindfulness in a fresh modern way. And they really work.&quot;Making a physical product is a whole new adventure for us and that is why we decided to use Kickstarter to bring it to life. Reaching our fundraising goal in just six days is a great result and we are now ready to go into production.&quot;All parts of the product are made in Scotland - from design to print and production - using the best available materials.To order a set of the Cards, visit https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rohangunatillake/cards-for-mindfulness

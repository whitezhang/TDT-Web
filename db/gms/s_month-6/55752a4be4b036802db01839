TUCKED away in Glasgow city centre is an unassuming laboratory most people will not know is there.But the team of 18 scientists who work in the lab are helping to save millions of lives around the world.Glasgow is home to the Cancer Research UK Formulation Unit, which develops and manufactures new cancer drugs.Founded in 1983, the lab works on around 25 new batches of cancer drugs every year.And it has been behind two huge success stories - Temodal, a chemotherapy drug treating certain types of brain cancer, and Zytiga, a hormone therapy to treat advanced prostate cancer.These drugs alone have helped more than 3.5 million patients both in the UK and internationally.Dr Moira Elliott is assistant director of the unit and has worked there for 17 years.She said: &quot;Essentially, we make medicines. We take powders that have been developed on a chemist's bench and we turn them into something that is safe for a human to take - something that may help a person who has cancer.&quot;Smaller laboratories that develop potentially life-saving drugs contact Cancer's Research UK (CRUK) New Agents Committee, in London.The committee will then decide whether these drugs have enough potential to be developed at the Formulation Unit.Dr Elliott added: &quot;Once the committee has decided that we can work with the lab we receive a batch of powder that we then have to find a suitable formulation for to allow it to be administered to patients.&quot;We can be sent as little as 10g of powder. Have been sent powders from as far away as America, Auckland and Hong Kong but the trials they are used for are all UK patients.&quot;The lab's speciality is parenterals - or, in layman's terms, injectables.Essentially, the scientists are responsible for turning a compound from a powder on a chemists' bench to a drug fit for a clinic.Once a drug arrives in the unit it undergoes analytical testing to determine its purity and quality and separate any impurities out.It is also turned into a liquid to make it safer to handle as powders are easily inhaled.Dr Elliott said: &quot;These are brand new cancer medicines and it's up to us to prove that they are stable and safe.&quot;The unit is the most sterile place in Glasgow - it undergoes 160 air changes per hour to help make sure it is scrupulously clean.Air is constantly being filtered in, moved around and pushed back out.The manufacturing area is divided into four zones - A to D - with A being the cleanest.Leading in to the clean zones is a sticky blue floor, which pulls the dirt from shoes.The scientists who work in the central zones wear complete protective clothing. The machine - a semi-automatic ampoule vial filling machine - has a human operator and it is humans who bring the contaminates in with them.When entering the centre area, the scientists wear a sterile coverall with a hood, overboots, gloves and a mask to keep the area sterile.Glass wear is cleaned in a hot oven to make sure it is completely pure and the machine's containment isolator is cleaned with hydrogen peroxide gas.Much of the work is done in the main laboratory, however.Dr Elliott said: &quot;We can't just pluck something off the shelf and say 'this is going to work,' but we can pluck experience off the shelf and apply it to what we are doing.&quot;We need to work out what the carrier for this drug will be and how stable it is - will it break down over time or become less effective.&quot;But results don't happen overnight. It can take 12 to 18 months to go from powder to patient.&quot;Since its foundation, the unit has handled around 100 compounds and manufactured more than one million units of drugs.The team can be working on between eight and 10 different drugs at any one time as well as being responsible for 15 to 20 compounds in clinical trials.The results of their work go to human trials, which are carried out in four phases.Phase 1 is the first time the medicine has been used on humans. It will be tested on a small group of people to find out if it works, if it is safe, what side effects it has and what the dose should be.Phase 2 sees the drug given to a larger group of people and to see if it is effective and to find out more about its safety.In Phase 3, when the drug is given to an even wider group of participants, its side-effects are monitored and information is collected on how to use the drug safely.And in Phase 3 the drug is on the open market but is still be assessed and its side-effects for long term use are monitored.Dr Elliott said: &quot;People who volunteer for Phase 1 trials are very brave. Obviously they are doing it for themselves - they hope that this medicine will help them.&quot;But they know that they are at the end stages of their illness and they want to help other people too. It might not work for them but it might work for someone else.&quot;That is a very brave step to take. I have wonderful admiration for that.&quot;Dr Karen McInnes, who looks after the legal aspects of the unit's work, added: &quot;We obviously don't get feedback on individual patients but we are kept up to date with the phases of each trial.&quot;There's an easier way to tell if something is a success though - we get increased orders for the drug.&quot;Drugs created in the unit are designed to attack solid tumours in patients.For the scientists working there it is important to keep thinking about those people with cancer who just might benefit from the tablets and injectables they make.Dr Elliott said: &quot;What makes the job exciting for us is that there is a patient at the end of our work.&quot;Dr McInnes added: &quot;We are in the lab working with chemicals all day so it's important for us to keep thinking about the people who will receive this drug and how it might help them.&quot;Cancer Research UK (CRUK) spends around &pound;1million a year on the unit, funding everything from pieces of equipment worth &pound;200,000 to Marigold gloves and hairnets costing pennies.The two doctors are now taking part in Pretty Muddy - a women-only, non-competitive 5k obstacle course... with added mud.Last year more than 5,000 runners took part in Pretty Muddy in Glasgow, raising &pound;230,000.In 2014 Cancer Research UK invested more than &pound;22 million supporting the work of outstanding scientists, doctors and nurses in the area, including a &pound;1 million annual grant for Glasgow's Formulation Unit.Cancer survival rates have doubled since the 1970s and Cancer Research UK's work has been at the heart of that progress. But more funds and more supporters are needed to bring forward the day when all cancers are cured.Cancer Research UK spokeswoman, Linda Summerhayes, said: &quot;There are still places left at Pretty Muddy, which is sponsored by Scottish Power, and we're calling on the fun loving ladies of Glasgow to lace up their trainers and take on cancer at this year's event.&quot;Race for Life is to celebrate those who are with us, and also remember those who are not. The atmosphere is electric, our participants are so inspiring and we're calling on the women of Glasgow to help make 2015 our best year yet.&quot;To enter Race for Life see www.raceforlife.org or call 0300 123 0770.

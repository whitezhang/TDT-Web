Award-winning McGhee's Bakery has announced plans to boost production capacity by a third at its flagship Glasgow bakery.
The firm is to invest &pound;3m in extending its facility at the M8 Food Park in Port Dundas.
The extension is due for completion in the spring of next year.
McGhee's, which recently won the 2015 Scottish Baker of the Year award for the first time, has further operations in Kilmarnock and Motherwell.
The company is forecasting revenue growth of about 10% in 2015/16. 
Managing director Gordon McGhee said: &quot;The business has enjoyed strong growth following our move to the M8 Food Park 10 years ago and we are fully focused on further building our reputation and offering. 
&quot;Our significant investment in extending the bakery will help us consolidate and expand that offering to customers, in particular in the export market and frozen food sectors.&quot;

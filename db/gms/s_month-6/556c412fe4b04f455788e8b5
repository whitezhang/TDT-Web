A former police headquarters in Glasgow is being put up for sale.
The 190,000 sq ft Pitt Street site was vacated recently by Police Scotland, which has relocated to new administrative headquarters in Dalmarnock.
The site was built in 1924 and used by the Scottish College of Commerce before being taken over by the then Strathclyde Police in 1975.
It is expected to be demolished to allow for new development.
Mandy Watson, from property agents Ryden, said: &quot;This is an exciting and rare opportunity and we look forward to bringing the property to the market. 
&quot;The site is well connected and would suit a whole range of uses.&quot;
Deputy Chief Constable Neil Richardson from Police Scotland said. &quot;This represents a significant milestone for Police Scotland as we move to a purpose-built facility in Dalmarnock that will support the regeneration of that local area. 
&quot;Pitt Street served the legacy Strathclyde force well for many years, occupying an enviable location in the heart of the city. 
&quot;We look forward to seeing that site being developed again for the benefit of the city.&quot;

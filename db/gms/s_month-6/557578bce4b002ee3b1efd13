A 16-YEAR-OLD girl was badly hurt after she fell 50ft from a cliff edge on to rocks below yesterday.
Fire teams, two coastguard crews and an RAF helicopter were called to a beach below Dunbar Castle, East Lothian , at 3pm after a passerby saw the fall and raised the alarm.
The girl was airlifted to hospital. Her injuries were not thought to be life-threatening. A fire service spokesman said: “We administered oxygen to the casualty who was airlifted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary suffering from neck injuries, a suspected broken leg and suspected head and spinal injuries.”
The circumstances surrounding the fall were unclear.

Prince Charles: Glasgow School of Art must be rebuilt as it wasPRINCE Charles heard about restoration plans for the fire-ravaged Glasgow School of Art and stressed that it must be rebuilt as it was.On his first visit to the iconic Mackintosh building since last year's devastating blaze, the royal patron expressed &quot;genuine shock&quot; at the damage.Wearing a hard hat and high-vis vest, he was led through the charred remains.In the Mackintosh library, one of the most famous rooms in the building, he showed concern as asked questions about the exposed floor, walls and beams.Liz Davidson, who is leading the restoration for the GSA, showed him a lantern from the library's centre-piece light fitting which was salvaged in an archaeological dig following the fire.Prince Charles praised all those involved in the project and stressed his opinion that it the Mackintosh building should be rebuilt as it was.Ms Davidson said: &quot;If you look at out other buildings you will see that Glasgow school of Art is not afraid of modern architecture.&quot;But Prince Charles was very much of the opinion that the building is so exceptional that it should be restored to its original appearance.&quot;We share this opinion and agree that this is not the time to be too interventionist or fanciful.&quot;The restoration project is currently in the research stage but building work it due to get underway in June next year.It is estimated that it will be complete by 2018 and cost between &pound;25 and &pound;35 million.The royal visitor was led on a tour of the building by GSA director, Professor Tom Inns, and chair of the Board of Governors and author Muriel Gray.Professor Tom Inns added: &quot;Prince Charles has always been a great supporter of the school. He's very passionate about traditional crafts and art and design - all things that are important to us as a school and as part of the work to bring this building back.&quot;He had seen pictures of the damage but he was genuinely shocked to see it up close.&quot;He was explaining how the Royal Family dealt with the Windsor Castle fire so I think he really understands how complex it is to deal with something like this.&quot;Prince Charles took asked for details about what can be done to save the building's many original features.Ms Davidson added: &quot;He is very knowledgeable about the building, more so than I think many people would expect.&quot;He has a passion for architecture, and historical architecture, but was also very in touch with the modern technology being used in the project and how this might engage young people.&quot;For the first time in a project of such scale, special technology is being used to make digital scans of every space in the Mackintosh building and these have been uploaded onto a computer to produce very detailed 3D images.Ms Davidson said: &quot;Prince Charles is a passionate supporter of the art school and he was saddened to see the damage but very positive about the future of the building - as we all are.&quot;Glaswegians, art students and artists from around the world were left devastated when the renowned institution was devastated by fire on May 23 last year.A fire investigation last year confirmed that the blaze began when a projector ignited gases from expanding foam used in a student project.While in the city yesterday, Prince Charles also officially opened the a new Innovation Centre at the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank.The centre will see staff share ideas work to develop new projects for the benefit of patients.And Camilla visited a Credit Union Fair at Glasgow's Trade Halls to celebrate the success of the city's credit unions.She was presented with money boxes for Prince George, Princess Charlotte and each of her other grandchildren.

 Mark Docherty says he turned down the offer of full-time football to sign for Dumbarton after leaving Scottish Championship rivals Alloa Athletic. 
 The 27-year-old full-back has signed a one-year contract to become Stephen Aitken's fifth signing since taking over as Sons boss. 
 &quot;I enjoyed my time at Alloa and it was sad to leave,&quot; said Docherty. 
 &quot;I did have a couple of other offers to consider, including an option to go full-time.&quot; 
 Docherty, who made 46 appearances in his second spell at Alloa, is familiar with his new manager and assistant Stephen Farrell. 
 &quot;I've worked with the gaffer and Faz before,&quot; he told Dumbarton's website. &quot;They both played a part in me joining the Sons.&quot; 
 He is the second arrival from Alloa this summer, Aitken having already recruited striker Kevin Cawley. 
 Docherty bean his career with St Mirren before spells with Montrose, Stirling Albion, Annan Athletic and Stranraer.

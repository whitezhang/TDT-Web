He disappeared on his way to work.His son said he discovered a tent in a nearby park, while out looking for his dad, and left a food parcel and water next to the makeshift camp.&quot;We saw the tent and thought we would leave some food and water - just in case,&quot; John added.Police are also probing a new possible sighting of the missing dad at the Lidl supermarket in Duke Street.And officers are preparing to search a series of disused tunnels in the Duke Street area.The Evening Times published pictures last week which showed John entering a local shop in Duke Street at about 7am on Tuesday May 12.A few minutes later he emerged with a paper and appeared to be heading to get the bus to work.The Murphy family say they are sure John got on a bus, as he usually would, but something has happened during the journey.John, 25, added: &quot;Police have checked CCTV from further along the street, in the opposite direction my dad was walking to, past the shop he went into.&quot;They couldn't pick him up on any other cameras.&quot;We are sure he got on a bus.&quot;If he didn't, he would have been picked up on another camera further down Duke Street as there are several others.&quot;His son has vowed not to give up his search until he finds his dad and brings him home.John added: &quot;He's still out there, I know he is.&quot;Something has happened to him on the way to work.&quot;He would never leave and not get in touch with any of us, everyone who knows him has said the same.&quot;Meanwhile, a Facebook page, set up by John to collate information and sightings of his dad, has gained almost 14,000 followers in less than a week.Inspector Alan Bowater, said: &quot;John is close to his family and it is completely out of character for him to not be in touch with them.&quot;His wife and children are extremely distressed and upset as they have not seen or heard from him in two weeks and they just want to know he is safe and well.&quot;John was last seen by his family at their home in Craigpark Drive before he went to bed on Monday, May 11.He is believed to have left his home early on May 12, and was thought to be heading to Easthall Park Housing Cooperative, in Easterhouse.He never arrived at work and his family raised the alarm later that evening when he failed to return home.When he left his home, he is believed to have been wearing a beige T-shirt, embroidered with Easthall Park's logo, a black jacket, black cargo trousers and black boots.Anybody who has information as to John Murphy's whereabouts is asked to please contact Police Scotland on the police number 101.

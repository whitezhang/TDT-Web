Clinical research firm ClinTec International is expanding its Johannesburg-based regional hub office for Sub-Saharan Africa on the back of a “significant” new assignment.
The Glasgow company, which now operates in more than 40 countries, said the move to larger premises will support its region-wide clinical research services, including a “significant new clinical
FSP [functional service provider] assignment with a global biotechnology major where ClinTec is the sole FSP partner for South Africa”.
ClinTec International executive vice president, Bobby Bal, said: “ClinTec has a track-record of aligning its investment programme with strategically important client needs
“Our continued investment in South Africa over the last five years demonstrates a consistent effort to address high-potential markets for clinical research.”
ClinTec has also announced three new “key director level” appointments, effective immediately.
Dr Fraser Smith joins the group as director of global quality and compliance, Jane Coward joins as of director of client relations and Insook Cho joins as regional director of clinical operations for North Asia.
ClinTec International was launched in 1997 to carry out clinical trials for pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device firms.

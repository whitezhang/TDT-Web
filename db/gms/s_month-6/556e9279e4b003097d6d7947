YOUNGSTERS from two Glasgow primary schools got together to recreate a photograph from 100 years ago.As part of a Sense Over Sectarianism project children from St Paul's and Wellshot Primaries took a journey on a horse and cart.The 'Communities United' Project helps two schools in the same local community explore the issues surrounding sectarianism together and also discuss what positive change they could be making.Yesterday afternoon pupils travelled to Tollcross Park and recreated the photograph which shows both Celtic and Rangers Fans travelling together by horse and cart to an Old Firm game in the Early 1900's.The children wanted to show that people can still have friendships and work together even though they support different football teams.It was also be a chance for them to celebrate the heritage of the local area and hope you can come along to show your support.

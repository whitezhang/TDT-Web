MORE than 2000 packs of foil have been handed out to Glasgow heroin users in a bid to stop them injecting the drug.As we revealed in February, foil was given out by healthcare workers to cut down the risks connected to injecting, following a botulism outbreak in the city.Users can use the foil to heat up and inhale the class-A substance instead of injecting with a needle.Police Scotland confirmed 44 &shy;people across Glasgow and the west were admitted to hospital in the six months from December.Ten of those people have died.In all cases the heroin is believed to have been sourced from Glasgow.It follows the arrest of two men during a raid at a property in Calton. Two other men were detained in connection with alleged drug offences.Around 300 addiction staff have been trained up as part of the project to encourage drug users to try foil.The pilot started in September last year but was stepped up following the cases of heroin being contaminated with the botulism toxin.Patients with botulism can often have blurred vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing and muscle weakness.If left untreated the illness can lead to paralysis and death.Dr Carole Hunter, lead pharmacist of addiction services at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), said: &quot;The basis is to get people away from injecting and smoking instead because that's far safer.&quot;The big thing is it reduces the risk of drug-related death immediately by about 14 times.&quot;More than 2000 foil packs have been given out from September last year until March, 2015.In February following the botulism outbreak, Turning Point Scotland's Glasgow Drug Crisis Centre joined the pilot and began handing out foil packs.There are now plans to extend it to pharmacy exchanges across the area.Ms Hunter said 500 drug users had switched from injecting to smoking because of the project.She said: &quot;We're surprised at how receptive both the staff and the service users have been.&quot;We've done other initiatives and they haven't all been as popular as this one.&quot;I think everyone can immediately see there are positive health benefits.&quot;There are benefits for the community as well - it cuts down on drug-related litter and the risks there.&quot;Using foil eliminates a number of injecting complications such as abscesses, ulcers and cellulitis.It also reduces risk to blood-borne viruses, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV.Ms Hunter said the aim was to reduce the number of people using heroin.She said: &quot;This is just helping people not to inject.&quot;This is not about promoting drug use but it is about promoting safer drug use.&quot;rachel.loxton@eveningtimes.co.uk

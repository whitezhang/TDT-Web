A LIONESS found in an &quot;online date&quot; has set up home with a new partner in Edinburgh Zoo.
Asiatic lion Roberta arrived last October from Magdeburg Zoo in Germany but has only recently been introduced to male resident Jay as part of a breeding programme.
As an endangered species, an international project was set up to boost the number of Asiatic lions and Roberta and Jay were paired by experts due to their age and ancestry from a database zookeepers compared to an online dating site.
The pair were introduced earlier this year but kept in separate enclosures as they got used to the presence and scent of one another.
After a bit of a fight over food today, they sat resting their heads on one another in their shared enclosure.
 

Staff say they are bonding well and are hopeful that cubs will come along in the next few years as Roberta, currently two, reaches maturity.
Alison Maclean, carnivores team leader at Edinburgh Zoo, said: &quot;Roberta has settled in nicely, although she is still a little shy and nervous.
&quot;She is slowly starting to warm to her mate Jay and can sometimes be seen sitting close to him.
&quot;Things are always competitive when there is food involved but it wasn't anything major and we're happy with how they're getting along.
&quot;We are hopeful that they will become a breeding pair and produce cubs in the not too distant future, which will be fantastic for Roberta and Jay as well as the overarching conservation breeding programme for this endangered species.&quot;

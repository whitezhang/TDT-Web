OPPOSITION councillors have hit out at cost-cutting plans to remove bus passes from school children.The plans formed part of this year's council budget and could force hundreds of children walk up to three miles to get to school.Eligibility changes mean youngsters at secondary school do not qualify for a free bus pass if they live less than three miles away from school - previously the threshold was 2.2 miles.For primary children the distance is only two miles, an increase of 0.8miles from the previous threshold.The plans are hoped to save the council around &pound;600,000 and will be implemented at the start of the next school term in August.SNP councillors have hit out at the changes after scores of concerned parents contacted them for help.The only way those living within the three mile radius of the school would qualify for free transport is if the route they would have to walk is deemed unsafe by council officers.Councillor John Letford, who looks after the Maryhill and Kelvin Ward, said around a sixth of the pupils affected in Glasgow are in his area and the main routes to schools would force children to walk under the Maryhill viaduct and along the busy Maryhill Road.He said: &quot;This proposal will impact 370 pupils schooled in Maryhill - that's nearly 1 in 6 of those affected in the city.&quot;Young children will now have to walk up to 2 miles in the wind, rain and snow.&quot;They'll have to navigate one of the busiest roads in Glasgow, skirting floods, heavy vehicles and speeding cars.&quot;If mums and dads can afford the privilege of using the expensive bus service - if there actually is one - it will cost already under pressure community up to &pound;200,000 per year in Maryhill alone.&quot;That's money which is already being used, in one of the most socially deprived wards in Scotland, to buy play pieces, school dinners and evening meals.&quot;It is money that pays gas bills, buys school shoes and pays council tax.&quot;This decision is shocking.&quot;His fellow ward councillor Franny Scally also accused the Labour administration of reneging on promises to parents to keep free transport for their children when three Maryhill schools were closed in the last council term.In Pollok, only one pupil is understood to be still receiving free transport under the new rules, while in Shettleston 11 pupils at Trinity High School will now be denied the service.Commenting on the plans, Glasgow SNP Leader Councillor Susan Aitken said: &quot;The SNP voted against these plans and has voted against Labour's two previous attempts to introduce this policy.&quot;We understand that difficult decisions need to be made, but we cannot see the sense in making our children walk for miles to school in all weathers and conditions.&quot;This is simply wrong.&quot;Councillor Stephen Curran, Executive Member for Education and Young People said: &quot;The changes to free school transport eligibility was agreed at the council's budget meeting in February and is still below the statutory obligation.&quot;The saving will be used to retain the number of teachers in our schools.&quot;We are in the process of communicating with parents over these changes and new safe routes to school for each child currently eligible under the old distances, being recalculated and a decision made on each.&quot;Where there are no safe routes to school - regardless of the distance - free school transport will remain.&quot;

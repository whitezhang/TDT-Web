NURSING home bosses yesterday launched an appeal for mourners to attend the funeral of a retired soldier who had no relatives but was “married to the job”.
Alex McDougall, who was originally from Glasgow, served his country for 30 years – surviving being shot at and once almost starving to death on limited rations.
He passed away at Beeston Lodge Nursing Home, Nottinghamshire, aged 77 on 8 June after suffering from dementia and cancer. 
Staff at the nursing home, where Mr McDougall lived for 18 years, said he was devoted to his job in the Army and had no known relatives or friends. 
They are now appealing for anyone with a link to Chetwynd Barracks, or the military in general to go to the service at Bramcote Crematorium at 3:45pm on Friday. 
Mr McDougall, a Rangers FC fan, will have his ashes scattered at Ibrox Stadium.
Aisha Morrell, activities and welfare manager at the nursing home, said: “He has no living family and no friends we are aware of, so it is unlikely anyone will be at his funeral. 
“He was very much married to the job. He told me tales of playing pranks on his Army friends. He was a very proud man. It doesn’t seem any way for a send-off.”

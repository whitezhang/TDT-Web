RMT members at ferry operator CalMac have voted for strike action and action short of a strike, according to the union.The maritime union issued ballot papers to hundreds of its members last month in a dispute over jobs, pensions and working conditions.Members voted by 92% for strike action and by 98% for action short of a strike in a turnout of 60%, the union confirmed today.Overall, 55% of the total number eligible to vote backed strike action and 58% of the total eligible voted for action short of a strike.The RMT said the industrial relationship with CalMac on the Clyde and Hebrides network has &quot;deteriorated&quot; in recent months to such an extent that it had &quot;no choice&quot; but to declare a formal dispute with the company.The union claims the ferry operator has failed to provide it with satisfactory reassurances over job security, conditions of service, pensions and continuity of lifeline ferry services for remote communities and businesses.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: &quot;The failure to give our members the most basic assurances meant that RMT had no alternative but to ballot CalMac members for strike action and industrial action short of strike action, in order to secure our members' rights during this period of increasing uncertainty and insecurity.&quot;That ballot has now concluded and members have delivered a massive and solid mandate for action.&quot;RMT remains available for serious and constructive talks aimed at resolving this dispute.&quot;A CalMac spokesman said: &quot;We note that the RMT union has announced the result of its ballot for industrial action. We recognise that there are difficult issues facing our employees currently. We acknowledge that our trade unions wish to support the interests of their members, however, we do not believe that taking steps toward industrial action is appropriate at this stage.&quot;We have only just entered dialogue on the matters. That process has only just started and hasn't had any chance to deliver progress. We would be concerned that a dispute now can only damage the prospects of reaching a mutually acceptable outcome.&quot;We remain committed to continuing the ongoing discussions with all trade unions.&quot;ends

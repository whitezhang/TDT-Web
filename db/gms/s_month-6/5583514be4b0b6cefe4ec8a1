ALASDAIR Gray, the author and painter, is in a critical condition in hospital after a serious fall outside his Glasgow home.
Mr Gray, 80, is reportedly being treated for a broken back and serious head and leg injuries. 
The incident happened around 2am outside his house in the west end of Glasgow.
Mr Gray is understood to have fallen down a flight of stairs and into the basement outside the property, where he was found by a neighbour. 
Mr Gray’s friend and gallerist Joe Mulholland told The Herald: “He is in critical condition in the Royal Infirmary. I don’t know how it happened but I understand the police are involved.”
A spokesperson for Police Scotland said that they were called to an incident in Glasgow’s Marchmont Terrace involving an 80-year-old man at 1.50am on Thursday.
They said inquiries were ongoing but no criminality is suspected at present.
Mr Gray’s injuries were not thought to be life threatening.
His son Andrew, who lives in America, is flying back to Scotland to be with his father. 
Mr Gray’s wife Morag passed away in 2014.

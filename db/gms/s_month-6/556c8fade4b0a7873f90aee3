MANY women in Scotland are being made to look OLDER by opting for the popular browlift botox injections - according to a top cosmetic surgeon.
Leading Glasgow and London-based botox specialist Dr Darren McKeown claims that the injections are often lifting eyebrows to the wrong height and that this can considerably age a person.
Many women believe making their eyebrows higher will make them look younger but Dr Darren claims the opposite is actually true and that the majority of rejuvenating surgery can end up having the opposite effect.
He said: â€œNext time you go visit your dad or mother in an old age home have a look at their eyebrows.
&quot;Old ladies in nursing homes have eyebrows halfway up their foreheads. When you use botox to lift the eyebrows you are not rejuvenating the face you are inadvertently ageing the face.
&quot;Getting the eyebrow height perfect to achieve a natural look is one of the most challenging techniques you can do in botox.&quot;

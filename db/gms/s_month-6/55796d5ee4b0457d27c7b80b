A DOCTOR performed emergency treatment on an injured dog – then organised a land and sea mercy mission to save his life.
Bob the collie was in danger of bleeding to death when he suffered a deep gash on his paw.
With no vet on the island of Eigg, owner Libby Galli rushed him to GP Geoff Boyes.
He applied a bandage to stem the bleeding and arranged for Bob to be taken by boat to Mallaig on the mainland.
The collie was then driven to a vet in Fort William, where he had three layers of stitches.
Geoff, who had travelled from Skye to hold a GP surgery on Eigg, said: “This was my first emergency evacuation.
“I put on a pressure bandage which stopped the bleeding and we organised an emergency transfer back to the mainland, on the boat that brings the doctors to the Small Isles.
“The cut was a challenging injury and I was worried his life might be in danger if he wasn’t taken off the island for prompt treatment.”
Artist Libby, 51, said: “Bob cut his leg really badly. We think he did it on a piece of glass.
 

“He lost an awful lot of blood. It was just pouring out, so I took him to the doctor.
“The people that were waiting to go into the doctor all said, ‘You go first’. They were really nice to him.
“The doctor must be a real animal lover because he arranged for the boat that was taking him back to Skye to take us on to Mallaig, where we have a car, so we could drive to the nearest vet at Fort William.”
It took two hours to complete the sea and road journey to Fort William, which is 43 miles from Mallaig.
Libby said: “The vets stayed open for us. Bob had cut a vein and a tendon.
“He is back home now and on the mend.”
Morag McGee, an animal nurse at Crown Vets in Fort William, said: “The cut was pretty bad. There was a tendon that was severely damaged and a dog can bleed to death.
“But the pressure bandage had stopped some of the bleeding. He is making a good recovery.”

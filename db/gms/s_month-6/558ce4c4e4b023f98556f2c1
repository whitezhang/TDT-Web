Arches closure law change bid thrown outA GLASGOW MSP is disappointed his bid to change the licensing law following the closure of The Arches.Patrick Harvie Green MSP for Glasgow tried to amend a Bill to ensure Licensing Boards took account of social and cultural life when reviewing licenses.He called for the change after the Arches was forced to close the overall arts venue when the nightclub lost it’s late license, effectively closing it down.Mr Harvie argues that the loss of the arts venue will leave a huge gap in the city.He said it will not help reduce recreational drug use wither only move it to clubs which are less responsible.His amendment was heavily defeated in the Scottish Parliament by 109 votes to 9.Mr Harvie said: &quot;It's unrealistic to imagine that recreational drug use will be reduced by closing one venue, especially one with a record of staff training, medical facilities and a willingness to report problems rather than hiding them.“The loss of The Arches leaves a huge gap in the social and cultural scene of Scotland's biggest city, and it's disappointing MSPs have chosen not to take the opportunity to reconsider licensing objectives.&quot;Justice Secretary Michael Matheson rejected Mr Harvie’s calls and said his amendment would damage the whole system of alcohol licensing in Scotland.He said: “It sits uneasy within an act whose values propose to regulate the sale of alcohol.He said it would : Undermine the whole licensing system and all it sets out to achieve.”Others said it was not the right Bill to be discussing the importance of cultural and social life of arts venues.Mr Harvie criticised the Justice Secretary’s response as “hyperbole”.He said if the licensing system was not the place for promoting social and cultural life then it was also not the place for the promotion of the country’s drug laws.He said “Drug use was the central issue that led to the (Arches) decision.I cannot accept that moving drug use from one venue to another makes any difference.”He said it would only make the problem worse as The Arches had trained staff and medical assistance for anyone under the influence of drugs.He also said its approach to drug find was also responsible but also led to its downfall.He said: “ The ideas that people who use recreation drugs will go to the Library or a poetry reading is nonsense. They will go to a less experiences less responsible venue.“Many others will not report drug finds to police but will flush them.”

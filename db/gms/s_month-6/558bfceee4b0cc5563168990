THOUSANDS of Taylor Swift fans will be going home last night with a feeling so good they’ll never want to Shake It Off – after watching the American superstar rock Glasgow.
The Blank Space singer landed in Scotland aboard her multi-million-pound private jet yesterday for the first sold-out date of the UK leg of her 1989 world tour. 

And thousands of her dedicated Swifties gathered at the Hydro hours before their heroine was due to take to the stage.
 
Many wore fancy dress in tribute to the 25-year-old songwriter and her music.

 And although there was no sign of her boyfriend, Scots superstar DJ Calvin Harris, the passion of her fans meant there was one huge Love Story in the air. 
Earlier, Taylor swept into the arena in a chauffeur-driven black limo for rehearsals.
It’s quite possible she'll be leaving on her Swifties’ shoulders..

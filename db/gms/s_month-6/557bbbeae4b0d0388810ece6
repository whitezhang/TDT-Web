POLICE threatened to arrest a man over this garden gnome – because it is baring its bum.
Joe Hayes, 60, couldn’t believe it when officers arrived at his door to chin him over the cheeky chappie.
Officers swooped after Joe’s neighbour – a former policeman – complained, saying the gnome was causing fear and alarm to his family.
Taxi driver Joe said: “The officers who came round were laughing about it but said in all seriousness, if I didn’t move the gnome, they would charge me.
“I had a pair of them sitting on plant pots. One of them is looking through a set of binoculars and the other one is showing his bum.
“Admittedly, they were facing into my next-door neighbour’s garden, but it is ridiculous that the police would come out for something like that. The gnomes are just a bit of fun.”

 Joe has moved the &pound;4 gnome out of sight. And he is trying to sell it and its partner in  crime, with a sign in his garden advertising “Two bad gnomes”. 
The cabbie and wife Bernadette, 58, have lived in the quiet cul-de-sac in Viewpark, Uddingston, Lanarkshire, for 28 years.
He said he and James Johnston, who moved to the street about four years ago, have had a series of bust-ups.
James, who has children aged 11 and 17, said: “There is more to this than the gnomes. There are other issues the police have identified with Mr Hayes and he has been asked by the police to move them before.
“He is putting fear and alarm into me, my wife and my young children.”

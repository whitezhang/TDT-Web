TWO people have been taken to hospital after they were knocked over by a bull on the loose in a town.
A woman in her 70s and a man in his 40s suffered minor injuries in the incident in Lerwick, Shetland, at about 7.45pm yesterday, police said.
 

The man was knocked over and trampled as people tried to get it into a trailer while the woman was knocked over earlier.
Both were taken to Gilbert Bain Hospital for treatment.
It is thought the bull had escaped from a field before wandering into the town.
 

Michael Waterhouse, 14, spotted the bull charging at a women at the end of a football game.
He told STV: &quot;The woman was walking away from the bull and couldn’t see it. She turned around but it was too late for her to move - I think she tried to jump out of the way.
&quot;I saw her fall down but the bull kept charging forward. A minute later it came back and tried to charge the crowd.&quot;
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “Officers saw the cow leaping over a wall at Tesco, it had already escaped at that time.
“It then travelled down South Road to the Clickimin Centre where it charged a woman in her 70s. She has not been seriously injured but was taken to hospital.
“The bull was escorted to a walled garden, where officers were able to take control of it. A man in his 40s was charged and stood on while they were trying to get it into a trailer. He was also taken to hospital.
“They brought in a cow to settle it down and it was taken back to its farm.”

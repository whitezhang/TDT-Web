PHYLLIS Wiper never thought she would live to see her 100th birthday.But the prospect of celebrating the milestone with her big sister was even more unbelievable.Margaret McVean, known as Rita, will mark her 102nd birthday in August.The remarkable sisters, who say staying positive is the secret to a long and happy life, came together to celebrate Phyllis' 100th birthday at a party in Parklands Country Club in Newton Mearns on Saturday surrounded by children, grandchildren and great grandchildren.Phyllis and Rita - who both still live independently - are the oldest of four born to parents Beatrice Maude Johnstone and Joseph Johnstone.They were brought up in Gourlay Street in Springburn along with younger siblings Zena and Tommy, who have both passed away.Phyllis's daughter Doreen Couper, 75, told the Evening Times: &quot;My Aunt Rita was the artistic one and mum was the academic one, but they are both so positive and happy.&quot;My Auntie Rita is always smiling and my mum has a fantastic sense of humour -when we get going we can laugh for ages.&quot;Phyllis and Rita have also kept in good health throughout their lives.Phyllis, who is soon to be a great, great grandmother, was a keen swimmer and former club captain of Springburn Amateur Swimming Club, a title which she passed on to her daughter.She said: &quot;I always loved to be in the water, I don't know why but I was drawn to it.&quot;I taught myself to swim and went on to swim competitively.&quot;Doreen added: &quot;In my mum's day you had to queue to get in the swimming baths then you had 30 minutes and if you weren't out in time they threw your clothes in the water. Mum would get out of the pool after 30 minutes and join the queue again to go back in.&quot;Phyllis said: &quot;I think being so fit when I was younger has a lot to do with living so long.&quot;Doreen also describes her mum as &quot;feisty&quot; and said this more apparent than ever when 10 years ago she tackled a thief who made the mistake of trying to steal her purse.Doreen said: &quot;Mum was waiting for the bus in Shawlands and she was aware of this man standing close to her.&quot;She then noticed that her handbag was open and her purse gone.&quot;The man made off and mum ran after him, straight across the busy road and the man jumped on a bus.&quot;Mum stood in front of the bus to stop it then ran on and up to the back where the man was. She challenged him and he dropped her purse and ran away.&quot;Doreen added: &quot;When I heard what she had done I was worried about her, but so proud.&quot;My mum worked so hard for everything she had.&quot;Phyllis's first job was at the Co-operative where she worked in book-keeping - something which she excelled in as she was very good with numbers.

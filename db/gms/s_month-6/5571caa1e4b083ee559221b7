THE Orange Order has defended a planned day-long event in Glasgow as a petition calling for it to be cancelled passed 25,000 signatures.
Dubbed “Orangefest”, the Order’s Cultural and Heritage Day will take place on Saturday between 9:30am and 4:30pm.
The George Square event includes music, speeches and religious aspects with a 400-strong parade through Glasgow city centre ending the day. The Orange Order said the aim was to create a better understanding of the group. Other civic and religious leaders have been invited to the event. The Order said it was paying for every aspect of the event.
It has been approved by Glasgow City Council but an online petition has called for it to be scrapped. The petition states: “The people of Glasgow and Scotland are sick of their voices going unheard in relation to sectarian, hate-filled Orange marches. Now we have to put up with Orangefest.”
The Order said the event was an “open invitation to gain a better understanding of one of Glasgow’s oldest and biggest fraternal and charitable organisations, warts and all”

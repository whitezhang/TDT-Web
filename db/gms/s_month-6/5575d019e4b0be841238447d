A warrant has been issued for the arrest of former Rangers captain Lee McCulloch after he failed to appear in court to face a charge of speeding.
The 37-year-old was expected to appear at Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court on Monday.
The warrant was granted by Justice of the Peace Alistair McLean after the player did not appear.
Mr McCulloch is alleged to have driven at 81mph in a 60mph zone on the M8 motorway on 8 July last year.

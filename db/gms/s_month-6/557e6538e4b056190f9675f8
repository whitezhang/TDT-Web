A TEENAGE leukaemia survivor is urging more young people to donate blood to help a city donation unit.Connor McDowall, 17, is encouraging 17-24-year-olds to donate blood at a pop-up donation unit running for two weeks at the St Enoch's Centre.The vital transfusion unit, usually located at Nelson Mandela Place, will move to the temporary site on the first floor of the shopping mall while their old premises are refurbished.It will be open from today opposite Debenhams inside the mall.Connor, from Renfrew, was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia in 2010 and was given the all clear in February last year.He said: &quot;During my illness I received so much blood and platelets and I know if it wasn't for the donors who gave, then my treatment would not have been possible.&quot;I just want more people around my age to understand that it could happen to them at anytime just like it happened to me and if they are able to give blood now they should try it.&quot;As someone who has had so many needles during my treatment I don't think giving blood is that difficult a thing to do if it helps someone else at a time when they really need it.&quot;Mrs Lynne Willdigg, Head of Donor Services for the West of Scotland, SNBTS says: &quot;We are extremely grateful to St Enoch Centre for supporting blood donation by providing this unit for us at this important time for blood stocks.&quot;Traditionally blood donations drop by approximately 20% over the summer period so every donation is most welcome at this time.&quot;Not only will this 'Pop Up' unit ensure we can collect from our existing donors but help us reach out to many new ones who maybe just didn't want to take those tentative first steps to donation.&quot;To book an appointment to donate please visit www.scotblood.co.uk or call 0845 90 90 999.

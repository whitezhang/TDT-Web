CELTIC FC marked the closure of Yorkhill hospital with a Â£10,000 donation to the charity which supports patients and families.&nbsp;The club's Chief Executive, Peter Lawwell, handed over a cheque to Yorkhill Children's Charity which will continue fundraising work to assist all hospital services at the new site.Celtic has a very close bond with Yorkhill Hospital and has donated hundreds of thousands of pounds over many years.Celtic players through the decades have made regular visits to the hospital to meet young patients and staff.Mr Lawwell said: &quot;Yorkhill Hospital has been synonymous with the Club's charitable vision for decades and we felt it was important to mark the closure of the hospital with a significant donation to the continued efforts of Yorkhill Children's Charity.&quot;During its long history it is difficult to imagine the huge numbers of children who have been cared for and the positive impact which Yorkhill has had on the lives of so many. We are delighted to have supported this work in some way.&quot;While the old hospital will close and a new chapter starts, it is important to remember that the fundraising work will continue through Yorkhill Children's Charity, based at the new hospital.&quot;We know that the high level of care given to children will continue at the new hospital and, while we celebrate the wonderful achievements of Yorkhill, we are delighted to support this new work and help make a positive difference to the lives of more and more children in need.&quot;

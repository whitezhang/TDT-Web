ON Sunday the Glasgow Mela will celebrate its 25th anniversary with a massive party in Kelvingrove Park.Around 40,000 people of all ages are expected to turn up to join in the fun at what has become one of the highlights of the Glasgow calendar.The West End park will be the setting for a sea of colour, sights, sounds and smells.But in 1990, the Mela was a very different event, staged in the confines of the Tramway Theatre.Devised as part of Glasgow's celebrations as European City of Culture, the event is now one of the largest in the country.Originating from Sanskrit and meaning 'to meet' the concept of Mela has developed to represent a coming together of many peoples from varied cultures, to celebrate their shared diversity.It is based on the traditions of the Indian sub-continent and has evolved to become an outdoor multi-cultural spectacular.The first Mela in Tramway was based around the idea of an Indian Bazaar and developed to what it is today despite early financial difficulties and having to recruit London based carnival experts as nobody in Glasgow had the experience to organise the festival.There were also issues with its home as Tramway became too small, Queens Park became waterlogged and Bellahouston suffered a mud slide forcing it to transfer at the last minute to Kelvingrove where it has been for the past decade.The people behind the Mela also changed with Glasgow Life taking over from the Scottish Academy of Asian Arts around six years ago.In that time, the number of people who attend the event has soared from around 10,000 to around 40,000.Surjit Sokhi was one of a small group of people responsible for setting up the Mela in Glasgow.He was a member of the Scottish Asian Action Committee which decided it wanted to stage something to mark the city's year as Cultural Capital of Europe.The Mela was the result and over the years Mr Sokhi has watched it grow from strength to strength.He said: &quot;That first year was a great success. We had street artists, serious performers and even a Chinese concert.&quot;In 1990 we had Indian restaurants and a reasonably large Asian community so it was not difficult for it to be a success.&quot;Mr Kohli said Glasgow residents embraced the Mela from the outset, establishing a new bond between the two communities.He added: &quot;I am pleased with how it has developed although I would like to see more serious performances as part of it.&quot;Comedian, writer and actor Sanjeev Kohli, who plays shopkeeper Navid in Still Games, attended the first Mela a quarter of a century ago.And on Sunday he will be back hosting the music and dance events on the main stage in Kelvingrove with his proud parents and children looking on.Sanjeev remembers the first Mela in Tramway being a big event for the Asian community in 1990.He said: &quot;I attended the first Mela with hair down to my shoulders and a beard so cut a very strange figure in Glasgow.&quot;I remember the Mela being a massive deal in 1990. It felt like a validation of Asian culture because it was the first time anyone had provided one focus for it.&quot;There was fashion, food, music under one roof. There was a lot of energy and vibrancy about it because there has always been a lot of vibrancy in Asian culture.&quot;Two years later, Sanjeev would take to the stage in the Mela for the first time - and he recalls the experience only too well.He said: &quot;In 1992, a friend of mine organised a fashion show and asked her pals who were over 6ft tall to model for her - I was one of them.&quot;I recall coming on to the tune Thunder by Prince so it was quite dramatic.&quot;I tried to do a model type walk and crossed my arms looking like a bouncer.&quot;I remember someone shouting in broad Glaswegian from the audience that I should have gone to Specsavers because I was wearing my glasses.&quot;Nobody was going to let me get away with thinking I was sexy so they punctured my pomposity.&quot;Sanjeev, who recently performed with the Still Game cast at record breaking sell out performances at the Hydro, can look forward to a more appreciative audience on Sunday.

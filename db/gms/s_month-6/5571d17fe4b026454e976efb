AN autistic schoolboy who was terrified of large crowds has starred in a village carnival in front of hundreds of people.
Charlie Bashford, 12, who has learning difficulties and a speech problem, was named Tweedbank Lad and led the festivities in his home village, near Galashiels.
And mum Caroline said being chosen for the role has made a massive difference to him.
She said: “It’s been amazing to watch him. We’re so proud.
“His confidence is definitely growing and it’s given his self-esteem such a boost.”
 

Caroline, 36, worried how he would respond to having such a high-profile role.
She admitted he had been prone to violent meltdowns and in the past, the family had shied away from noisy public gatherings.
The mum of four said: “Charlie needs a lot of help with everything and he struggles if we go out. He finds it hard to cope with people around him.
“It’s made us feel more confident because we shouldn’t have to hide him away because he’s got autism.
“It’s shown that he’s just the same and just as big a part of the community as any other child. Everyone has been so kind.”
Charlie was selected as Tweedbank Lad with his classmate Carmen Paterson-Benton as Tweedbank Lass.
Their duties included leading the parade through Tweedbank on a horse and cart and exchanging ribbons with the Galashiels Braw Lad Cameron Pate and Braw Lass Abbie Frankland.
 

They also took part in judging the fancy dress competition.
Caroline admitted he did struggle with some parts and wasn’t keen on getting a kiss from the Braw Lass.
But she says he enjoyed the experience.
She added: “Charlie’s so proud of himself. He is wearing his special tie every day and loves having bunting up at the house.
“When he ran away from the Braw Lass, everyone just laughed. There was no
nastiness. It’s been such an incredible experience and we’re all so thankful.”

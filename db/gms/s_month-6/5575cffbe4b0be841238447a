A teenage boy who set fire to his mother after spraying her with lighter fuel as she lay in bed has been detained for 21 months.
The boy admitted assaulting his mother to the danger of her life at a house in Newmilns, East Ayrshire, in January. 
The 15-year-old had been brought home by police on the night of the incident. He later told his mother: &quot;Don't go to sleep - I'm going to burn you in bed.&quot;
He will be detained for a further 10 months after his release. 
Kilmarnock Sheriff Court heard the boy, who is now aged 16 but cannot be named for legal reasons, set fire to his mother as she slept before punching and kicking her as she tried to extinguish the flames. 
He then told her: &quot;Don't bother contacting the police - I've cut the wires.&quot; 
His mother fled the house in her night clothes and ran to a friend's home. She was described as being &quot;chalk white and in a state of shock&quot; and had suffered bruising and singed hair.
When police arrived, the boy threw a piece of banister at them and then brandished a baseball bat at the officers, who drew their batons and CS gas sprays. 
The boy was then restrained and handcuffed.
He also admitted cutting the telephone line, acting in a threatening or abusive manner, shouting, swearing and challenging police to fight.

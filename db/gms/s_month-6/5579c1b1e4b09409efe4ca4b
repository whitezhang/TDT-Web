A PUB poker player scooped a &pound;10,000 prize after winning a tournament in Las Vegas.
Gordon Cuthill, from St Andrew’s, became the UK Pub Poker champ after beating off 99 other players on the day - the finale of a year-long tournament which saw more than 30,000 entries.
He secured the &pound;10,000 top prize, which included a &pound;5,000 sponsorship deal.
Gordon, who plays at the Ceres Inn in Fife, said: “I feel completely numb. I honestly can’t believe that I have done it and actually won the Vegas 100!
“When I came to Vegas I did feel pretty confident and early on I played a couple of games well, which made me think I had a chance of winning the tournament but so did 99 other people and so it only just sinking in that I have actually won it!”

Martin Green, managing director of Redtooth Poker, who organised the competition, said: “Over the years the competition has just got bigger and better. We are absolutely delighted for Gordon and would like to congratulate him on winning this prestigious tournament.”
In its ninth year, Vegas 100, is the UK’s largest live pub poker league with more than 1,000 venues. More than 180,000 players have registered with the event since it was launched.

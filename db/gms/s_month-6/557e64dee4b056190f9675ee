ONE of Glasgow's biggest engineering projects has helped to make further regeneration work across the city a reality.The Camlachie Burn Overflow is a huge underground pipe, designed as a &pound;13 million anti-flooding measure extending across Glasgow's East End.It was built in the run up to the Commonwealth Games, and as a response to flooding chaos across the East End in July 2002, but its importance has stretched far beyond that.The restoration of the burn as an open watercourse in Beardmore Park, the creation of a further watercourse in the existing carriageway of Shettleston Road and several other projects have all been made possible by the original investment downstream.Completed in 2012, 10 years after the flooding, the Camlachie Burn Overflow came in on time and in line with the budget.The gaping hole in the ground where it begins eventually leads through to the River Clyde.While the massive project's primary purpose was to improve drainage in the region in order to avoid another disastrous flood, its construction also meant regeneration work could be carried out elsewhere.The risk of potential problems being transferred downstream was removed, and with adequate surface water drainage, several sites which had seen their plans halted could be developed once more.Glasgow City Council was behind the construction of the pipe itself, but it is a key part of a wider plan of flood prevention carried out by the Metropolitan Glasgow Strategic Drainage Partnership (MGDSP).The MGSDP is made up of nine different organisations, all dealing with the sewerage and drainage network, and covers seven local authorities.The projects making up the next phase of works are receiving funding from MGSDP's part of the City Deal funding package, along with grant funding from the Scottish Government.Once completed the massive project's route saw it run under locations including the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, the Athletes' Village and the East End Regeneration Route.Since then, areas around Celtic Park, the Emirates Arena and nearby sites, more parts of the Athletes' Village and other developments on Springfield Road have all had their surface drainage connected to the Camlachie Burn Overflow.Further emphasising the scale of work made possible by the original project are the re-profiling of the burn near Biggar Street and repair work to a tunnel carrying the burn in the Rigby Street area.The restoration of the open watercourse at Beardmore Park is part of the MGSDP's goal of using water to make the city a more enjoyable place for the public, rather than hiding it away underground.Councillor Liz Cameron, Executive Member for Jobs and the Economy, said: &quot;We are working with the MGSDP to reduce the risk of flooding in areas considered to be among the most vulnerable to regular flooding in the city during heavy periods of rain.&quot;The work we're doing has wider environmental benefits as well as supporting future growth in the local economy.&quot;More infrastructure work is being planned for the future, but it all requires a large amount of prior planning, due to the risk of flooding that is always present.

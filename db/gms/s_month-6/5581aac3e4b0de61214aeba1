“Mr McDonald had significant injuries, and we’re trying to establish just how he sustained them by piecing together his last known movements. Understandably his family and friends are completely devastated, and specialist officers are providing them with support at this tragic time.
“It is imperative we find who is responsible for Albert’s death. I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of Cumbernauld Road around 2130 hours or earlier, and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward to police. You may think that the information you have is insignificant however it may be the piece of information we are looking for.
“Cumbernauld Road is an exceptionally busy area at most hours of the day. It is one of the main routes from the North and East of the city into Glasgow City Centre, so I am confident that there may be more witnesses that could come forward to help us with our enquiries.”

Public health officials "concerned" by rise in HIV infections in GlasgowTHE number of new HIV infections has soared in the Glasgow area.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde would expect to see 10 new cases each year through drug injection but there has been 17 cases already.Public Health Officials said they are &quot;concerned&quot; about the rise and drug users are being urged to protect themselves.There are on average 115 new cases of HIV in Greater Glasgow and Clyde each year, the majority of which are sexually transmitted.Dr Catriona Milosevic, Consultant in Public Health Medicine, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: &quot;Already this year we have seen the number of new HIV infections in people who have a history of injecting drugs exceed the number for the whole of 2014.&quot;We are very concerned to see signs of increased HIV transmission in this population.“We need people who are injecting drugs to be aware of the risks. HIV has not gone away and is a risk now.&quot;There are three key messages: if you are injecting use clean fresh equipment and never share, use a condom for sex, and take an HIV test. You won’t know if you have HIV unless you test and it is important to diagnose and treat HIV early.“There is support available for drug injectors including foil for smoking heroin as an alternative to injecting, and needle exchange units who provide a range of clean equipment. No drug injector needs to share equipment when it is readily available.They are being reminded to use fresh equipment every time they inject and condoms for sexual intercourse.“The ultimate goal for the NHS is for drug users to recover from their addiction and remain drug free. However until someone is ready to seek and receive help it is important to keep them as safe as possible while they continue to use drugs.”Susanne Miller, Glasgow’s Chief Social Work Officer and chair of the city’s Alcohol and Drug Partnership, said: “The rise of HIV cases among those who inject drugs is clearly an issue of concern.“Our street teams are constantly seeking to engage with those with addictions issues to divert them to the appropriate services.“Clean needles are widely available for injectors and staff routinely spell out the dangers of sharing needles with other users.&quot;

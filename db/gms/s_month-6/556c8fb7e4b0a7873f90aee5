Property agent Ryden has been appointed to market the former Strathclyde Police headquarters site in Glasgow city centre for commercial development.
The 1.37 acre site, which has existing buildings totalling 190,000 sq ft on an entire ‘island site’, is billed as “one of the rarest and largest commercial development opportunities in the city centre to become available for many years”.
Police Scotland recently relocated to new purpose-built facilities at Clyde Gateway in Dalmarnock, releasing 173 Pitt Street to the market.
Ryden has been tasked with devising a disposal strategy and marketing the property to secure best value for Police Scotland.
The Scottish Futures Trust, which delivers infrastructure investment projects on behalf of the Scottish Government, is providing strategic support to Police Scotland on the project as part of a wider initiative to assist public bodies with disposal of their surplus assets.
Marketing for the site “will be launched shortly”, Ryden said.
Ryden's head of public sector, Mandy Watson, said: “This is an exciting and rare opportunity and we look forward to bringing the property to the market.
“It is likely that the existing buildings will be demolished to pave way for new development.
“The site is well connected and would suit a whole range of uses.”
Detective Chief Constable Neil Richardson of Police Scotland, added. “We’re delighted to confirm the appointment of Ryden to market the former Pitt Street Police headquarters.
“This represents a significant milestone for Police Scotland as we move to a purpose built facility in Dalmarnock that will support the regeneration of that local area.
“Pitt Street served the legacy Strathclyde force well for many years, occupying an enviable location in the heart of the city.
“We look forward to seeing that site being developed again for the benefit of the city.”

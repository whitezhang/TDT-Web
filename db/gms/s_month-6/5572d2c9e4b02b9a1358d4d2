 STARS gave Still Game’s Pete the Jakey a showbiz send-off yesterday. 
 Celebrities from stage and screen saw actor Jake D’Arcy – real name John Sinclair – take his final bow at Glasgow Crematorium to the strains of Frank Sinatra’s One for My Baby. 
Still Game stars Greg Hemphill, Ford Kiernan and Gavin Mitchell joined other Scots celebrities including Tony Roper, Jonathan Watson, Paul Young and Dave Anderson to pay their respects.

Jake, who died aged 69, was also famous for roles in Gregory’s Girl, Tutti Frutti and A Sense of Freedom.
His long-term partner, actress and ex-dancer Natasha Gerson, paid a touching tribute to him.
She described the actor, a keen hillwalker, as a loyal and discreet friend and devoted to his family.

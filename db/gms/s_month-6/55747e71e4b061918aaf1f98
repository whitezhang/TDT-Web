A bogus caller has pushed an 81-year-old woman and forced his way into her Irvine home before stealing her handbag. 
Police officers described the man, believed to be between 20 and 29 years-old, as a &quot;despicable individual&quot;.
He knocked on the woman's door on Frew Terrace at about 17:00 on Friday 5 June and claimed to be from the Water Board. 
He is described as having an Ayrshire accent, was between 5ft 8in and 5ft 10in tall and of medium build.
After pushing past the woman he made off with her handbag, which contained money and personal items.
Det Con Gail Howat of Saltcoats CID said: &quot;This man is a despicable individual who has preyed on the most vulnerable in our community. 
&quot;It is totally unacceptable to leave elderly people feeling unsafe within their own homes.&quot;
She added: &quot;I want to reassure those in the Irvine that we are doing everything we can to trace the man responsible.&quot;

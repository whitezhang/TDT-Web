Forecasters have warned of an unseasonable spell of severe weather affecting large parts of Scotland.
The Met Office has issued a yellow &quot;be aware&quot; warning for Monday and Tuesday. Ferry operator CalMac said 17 of its 26 services have been disrupted. 
Southerly gales with gusts reaching speeds of up to 50mph and heavy rain have been forecast.
Winds gusting up to 70mph could affect the Irish Sea with large waves on the west coast, the Met Office said. 
The warning said: &quot;An unseasonably windy spell is likely across many parts of the UK later on Monday, overnight and well into Tuesday, as active frontal systems sweep across the UK. 
&quot;Given the unseasonable nature of the winds, the public should be aware of the potential for disruption to transport and outdoor activities. Damage to some trees seems likely.&quot;
Ferry services affected included sailings between Oban and Lochboisdale and Oban and Castlebay, also Ardrossan and Brodick and sailings to Gigha.

High winds which hit parts of Scotland have eased off, letting crowds enjoy summer festivals across the country.
Gales and rain had disrupted a number of events at the start of the weekend, while several children were injured when a bouncy slide blew over in Fife.
The Meadows Festival went ahead in Edinburgh on Sunday, after being called off completely on Saturday.
In Glasgow, the West End Festival staged its annual parade and BBC Music at the Quay hosted events all weekend.
The sun even came out at the Meadows Festival, in contrast to Saturday's wash-out.
The West End Festival Sunday Parade in Glasgow say thousands take to the streets, with dancers and musicians winding their way from the Botanic Gardens to the Kelvingrove Bandstand.
The entertainment for BBC at the Quay, based around Saturday's BBC Music day, ranged from hip hop and dance music workshops to a full line-up of BBC Introducing bands on the outdoor stage.
The sun also shone eventually on the UCI Mountain Bike World Cup in Fort William.
Organisers said the crowds &quot;lapped up the magical atmosphere&quot; - where they were also treated to a masterclass from stunt rider Danny MacAskill.

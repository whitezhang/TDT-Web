 

A MOTHER has been forced to hold graveside vigils beside her dead son in a bid to thwart vile vandals who have launched campaign of destruction against his headstone.
Devastated Teresa Fleming branded the yobs “evil” as she cleaned up the latest attack on his grave - the 20th since the 28-year-old died suddenly in 2013.
In the latest incident, tomato sauce was smeared over the Stephen’s memorial.
Teresa said she can’t sleep with worry because of the hate campaign.
The 54-year-old told our sister paper, the Dumfries and Galloway Standard: “It’s disgusting.
“They obviously used tomato sauce to make it look like blood.
“We’re all devastated. It’s evil.”
The heartbroken mum told how she was forced to keep a graveside vigil for months after yobs targeted Stephen’s memorial more than 20 times.
The Dumfries woman said she had been in a “constant state of turmoil” since her boy died in 2013.
 
 

She claimed vandals had regularly wrecked his headstone by chiselling out his picture, daubing it with paint, ripping up flowers and throwing personal items in the bin.
 She said: “My family have all still been taking it in turns to check the grave every day but the attacks seemed to stop after the original article was printed . 
“But on Saturday my son and my daughter’s partner went up and found fresh flowers and cards were gone and the headstone was covered in what we thought was red paint but it’s actually tomato sauce.”
She added: “We can’t sleep at night with worry about it.
“We can’t even put his picture on the stone because they chiselled it out last time. ”
A police spokesman said: “The fact that this gravestone appears to being singled out and targeted makes it even more despicable.
“We are patrolling the area but we appeal to the public to get in touch with us if they see anyone acting suspiciously in any cemetery.
“These are final resting places, not playgrounds, and they should be treated with respect.”
Anyone with information should contact Police Scotland on 101.

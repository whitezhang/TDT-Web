GLASGOW city centre's top cop has insisted his officers are not overusing the powers of stop and search to target homeless people.However, Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland warned that an area known as the 'four corners', where rough sleepers often gather, is a hot spot for violent crime and disorder.And the Area Commander has vowed to crack down on the criminals, whether they are homeless or not.Homelessness charities in Glasgow have previously claimed that police are unfairly targeting rough sleepers.Sandy Farquharson, Director of The Marie Trust in Midland Street, contacted the force about the use of stop and search outside the centre, which he has described as &quot;heavy-handed, unreasonable and excessive.&quot;Lorraine McGrath, Chief Executive of Simon Community Scotland, which sends out a street team every night, added that homeless people are &quot;stigmatised&quot; by police.Chief Inspector Sutherland defended his officers against the criticism.&quot;There is absolutely no directive regarding homeless people in terms of stop and search,&quot; he insisted. &quot;We have absolutely no desire to target homeless people in terms of stop and search.&quot;If we have an area which is showing excessive numbers of violent incidents or antisocial behaviour incidents it is only right and proportional that we would look to increase our stop and search in that area but that's absolutely not designed to target to homeless people.&quot;It will be intelligence-led and based on information we have at that time. The areas move from time to time depending on where we have issues.&quot;The city centre area commander admitted that the force is in a constant battle against violent criminals in parts of the city centre.He said: &quot;The area known often as the four corners continues to be a problematic area for violent crime. I'm talking about from Gordon Street, down Union Street to Argyle Street into Midland Street. It's one of our most problematic areas.&quot;While it continues to be a problematic area for violent crime it's only right for the Glasgow public that we continue to have a high presence in there and continue to use appropriate policing tactics.&quot;At the moment the four corners and the surrounding area remains an issue in terms of violence and disorder both during the day and at night and we will continue to commit resources to that area.&quot;But my officers have been briefed regarding the existence of the charities and the homeless community in Glasgow to make sure their policing tactics are proportionate at all times.&quot;Charities have estimated that up to 800 people sleep rough at dozens of hidden sites throughout the city.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland, said: &quot;It's difficult to estimate the number of homeless people in Glasgow. They are often unseen, sleeping in basements and lanes through the night and then move on during daylight hours.&quot;Homelessness remains an issue for Glasgow generally, and particularly in Glasgow city centre where there is a definite homeless community that exists and continues to remain.&quot;For us, the police, it's very much a balance between promoting the health and wellbeing of the homeless community and trying to, where we can, refer those who are vulnerable on to other agencies.&quot;We also have to ensure there is no negative impact in terms of antisocial behaviour. Rough sleeping is technically not illegal. There are a number of offences which can be committed under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act, such as obstructing the footpath. There is also some antisocial behaviour legislation which could be brought into play with regards to homelessness but there is no specific legislation for sleeping rough.&quot;Often what can be found where there are a number of homeless people sleeping, or if they remain for a period of time, they can gather up bedding, there can be an issue with urinating and defecating. Where that's close to residential or office premises it can obviously lead to a conflict of interest there.&quot;Glasgow's top cop said they are often called out to deal with complaints about homeless people.Chief Inspector Sutherland said: &quot;It tends to be from the business community in Glasgow when you have people sleeping rough in fire exit doorways and basements and that type of thing.&quot;We will deal with that first and foremost on an advice and guidance basis. We will speak to the homeless individuals themselves to make sure they are aware they are causing problems and that there has been a report regarding their activity and the location that they're sleeping in.&quot;We'll also try to find out why that person is homeless, who they are, why they're in Glasgow city centre and try and assess their needs in terms of vulnerability.&quot;Chief Inspector Sutherland met recently with charities and intends to foster a closer partnership in future.&quot;We try to speak to the charities which do a lot of good work throughout Glasgow to try and assist where we can and I think that's something we'll be looking to enhance, moving forward,&quot; he added.&quot;We have met recently with the both The Marie Trust and the Simon Community to make sure we understand exactly what the issues are for each organisation to try to make sure our relationship is better and much more of a partnership moving forward.&quot;

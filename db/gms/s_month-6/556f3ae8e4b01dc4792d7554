A MAN and woman who stabbed a friend and then dumped his body in the River Clyde - leaving him to drown - were jailed for eight years and one month and six years and four months respectively.Kevin Caughey, 33, and Margaret McKellar, 31, admitted killing dad-of-four Scott McGuire around 3am on July 8, 2014 at the Portland Street suspension bridge at Carlton Place, Glasgow.The High Court in Glasgow heard that the stabbing injuries to Mr McGuire, 41, were minor, but he hit his head on a rock as he was pushed into the river.Caughey and McKellar made no attempt to rescue him from the water or get help for him.His body was spotted the following day by a passer-by. The court heard that the incident was sparked by a row which led to Mr McGuire hitting McKellar with a bottle.The pair then attacked Mr McGuire.Yesterday Judge John Beckett QC told the pair: &quot;This senseless killing of a man of 41 has left his family bereaved. He is survived by his father and four grown up children.&quot;While I accept he may have triggered the attack by initially using violence, you reacted with wanton violence. Mr McGuire was repeatedly struck on the head and body with a knife and pushed into the river where he hit his head on a rock. &quot;You left the scene doing nothing to help him yourself or seek help for him.&quot;Advocate depute Alison Di Rollo, prosecuting, said: &quot;The injuries caused by the use of a knife or knives were superficial and did not contribute directly to his death.&quot;Pathologists concluded that the cause of death was drowning.&quot;The court heard that McKellar had been in an on/off relationship with Mr McGuire for 13 years.Miss Di Rollo added: &quot;Over the days afterwards both accused made a number of comments to friends and associates to the effect that they had assaulted - 'battered' - Mr McGuire and pushed him into the River Clyde, and that he had hit his head on a rock as he entered the water.&quot;Both were originally charged with murder, but their plea of guilty to the reduced charge of culpable homicide was accepted by the Crown.When initially questioned by police about the death of Mr McGuire, McKellar and Caughey both claimed that he was alive and well when they left him at the suspension bridge.Caughey has 74 previous convictions, including seven for possessing a weapon, and McKellar has 60 previous convictions including assault.Defence QC Donald Findlay, representing Caughey, said: &quot;Mr McGuire used violence towards Miss McKellar and my client intervened.&quot;Mr McGuire ended up in the Rivewr Clyde, unfortunately striking his head as he went in. He realises he ought to have done something about the fact this man was in the river, but did not.&quot;He has expressed remorse in regard to what happened and the consequences for Mr McGuire.&quot;Defence counsel Tony Graham, representing McKellar, said: &quot;This was an argument which escalated. There was an assault on her, then an assault on Mr McGuire resulting in his death.&quot;She does accept her part in this man's death. She accepts she has deprived a family of a loved one. She has asked me to apologise for what happened.&quot;

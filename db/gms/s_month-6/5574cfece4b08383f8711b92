A SCOTTISH secondary school is at the forefront of helping to tackle the security problems which make cybercrime possible.
Kyle Academy in Ayr decided the best way to tackle the cyber security problem is through education.
In a ground-breaking partnership with Police Scotland, the school created a course for first years on how to identify the dangers their families face while on the net.
It is understood to be the first course of its type in Europe and has already attracted the interest of police forces and schools throughout the UK.
Even PM David Cameron has been briefed on it.
All other South Ayrshire schools with a computing department will use it next term.
The school is one of three finalists in the Learning Through Technology category at the Scottish Education Awards. The ceremony, hosted by comedian Des Clarke, is at the Thistle Hotel in Glasgow on Wednesday.
 
Computer science principal teacher Scott Hunter said: “We worked with police to create a Police Scotland Cyber Security Open Badge – much like you would get in the Scouts.
“The first years come in for a 10-week course. As part of it, they go home and examine their security and teach their parents about cyber security.
“The police supplied us with real case studies – like extortion on the web – so pupils could relate to what goes on rather than me just saying, ‘This is dangerous’. This had a great impact.
“They learned how Russian gangs target Scotland and they have to worry about that and not just friends learning their passwords.”
Scott hopes to work with Education Scotland to create a Massive Open Online Course in cyber security for parents.

MIKE Ashley's injunction stopping Rangers from blowing the lid off certain controversial details of contracts with Sports Direct has no teeth in Scotland,according to one of Scotland's leading lawyers.Sports Direct won the gagging order against Rangers at the Chancery Division of London's High Court to prevent secret information being revealed at theshareholders meeting called by Mr Ashley's Mash Holdings firm to be held at Ibrox on Friday.Sports Direct argued that some information had already been leaked to the press and was concerned that confidential information relating to thecommercial links, including the controversial joint venture retail deal, between the Ashley-controlled sports group and Rangers would be divulged atFriday's meeting.Rangers' lawyers said there was no evidence as to the actual source of any leaks and said the injunction was unnecessary as there was no indicationfrom the club directors of any intention to breach undertakings of confidentiality,A judge ruled: &quot;I am satisfied there is a real risk of disclosure tomorrow of confidential information&quot;.Mr Ashley's sports firm is understood to have been awarded costs of &pound;20,000 at the Royal Courts of Justice in the injunction hearing.But Austin Lafferty, a past president of the Law Society of Scotland said that the injunction secured in England is null and void unless Sports Directextend its reach through the Court of Session in Scotland.&quot;I am clear that a High Court injunction does not extend to Scotland, unless a subsequent procedure is undertaken (in Scotland),&quot; he said.&quot;They should maybe have done it in both courts or started it in the Court of Session.&quot;I am still astounded they don't seem to remember these things.&quot;In June, 2011 sister paper, the Sunday Herald named Ryan Giggs as one of the celebrities whose identities were protected by so-called superinjunctions after the paper argued it was not bound by an English court's injunction. The paper argued that it could name Giggs because his lawyers had not sought agagging order in a Scottish court.The High Court move came after Mr Ashley forced an extraordinary general meeting to force Rangers to pay back a &pound;5 million emergency loan given tothe club in January.Rangers responded in a statement by threatening to disclose certain details of the Rangers Retail joint venture deal set up by former Rangers chief executive Charles Green including a breakdown of the income to the club, at Friday's Ibrox showdown meeting.But the Rangers International Football Club plc board, also noted that directors would have to be &quot;mindful&quot; of confidentiality provisions that Mash soughtto enforce.The Rangers Supporters Trust, which has called for the stepping up of a boycott of official Rangers merchandise in protest at secrecy over the Ashley retail deal, said they hoped the board would still be able to divulge new details of the agreements at Friday's meeting, that was safe to present to shareholders.An RST spokesman said: &quot;If they can give us a breakdown of the financial information, for instance, from Rangers Retail, then it is not a huge leap to work out how bad the deal is.&quot;Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley sent his lawyers to court after the Daily Record newspaper carried reports of what the judge was told was secretinformation relating to commercial links between Sports Direct and Rangers which, it was claimed in court, must have come from board members.Mrs Justice Asplin granted the injunction, saying if a breach of confidentiality occurred it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to quantify andcompensate.David Quest QC, appearing for Sports Direct, said Rangers were offering an undertaking to stop disclosure, but there was a dispute over the scope of theoffer.He said Rangers chairman Dave King was quoted in a newspaper that he planned to use Friday's meeting &quot;to blow the lid off secret details of thecontracts handed to Ashley's retail company Sports Direct by previous Rangers (chief executive) Charles Green&quot;.If confidential information did come out at the meeting &quot;there is no putting the worms back in the can&quot;, Mr Quest told the judge.Louis Mably argued for Rangers that the claim was &quot;entirely speculative&quot;.But the judge ruled the &quot;balance of convenience&quot; was in favour of granting the injunction.Since the loan was agreed in January, Mr Ashley, who is Newcastle United owner has been the &quot;ultimate controlling party&quot; of Rangers Retail, whichhandles the club's merchandising and stores. Papers confirmed the switch was made from the previous controllers, RIFC plc as one of the conditions ofthe loan.Rangers declined to comment. Sports Direct were approached for comment.

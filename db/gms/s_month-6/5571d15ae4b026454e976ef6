ZIP up the cagoule and batten down the hatches – June has arrived complete with severe weather warnings, 50mph gales and travel disruption.
The Met Office have issued a yellow “be aware” warning for every area of Scotland apart from Orkney and Shetland. They predict southerly gales with gusts reaching 50mph and more heavy rain.
Conditions offshore are even worse with 70mph gusts on the Irish Sea and huge waves on the west coast.
Yesterday, there was 20-40mm of rain in northern and western areas.
Ferry operators CalMac said 21 of their 26 services had been disrupted, with boats to Islay, Cowal, Colonsay, Bute and Arran cancelled. Traffic Scotland issued high wind warnings for the Forth Road, Skye, Erskine and Dornoch bridges and warned of surface water on Strathclyde roads.
The stormy conditions are caused by a powerful jet stream stretching across the Atlantic into the UK. A front that crossed from the west on Monday will continue well into today as a vigorous depression crosses northern Scotland.
Winds will become west or south-westerly with gusts reaching 40-50mph before gradually easing.
Large waves will affect some coasts in the west and south at times. The Met Office warned: “Given the unseasonable nature of the winds, the public should be aware of the potential for disruption to transport and outdoor activities. Damage to some trees seems likely.”
There is some better weather on the way. Although temperatures dropped to 5C last night, it is due to get warmer as the week goes on.

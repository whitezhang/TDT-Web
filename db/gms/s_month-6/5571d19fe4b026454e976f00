A HERO rescuer plunged into icy seas to save the lives of two young women who were &quot;seconds from death&quot; following a late-night dip.
Coastguard Allan Corse, 26, managed to swim 75 metres to reach the stricken duo before being hauled back to shore on a safety line with one woman under each arm.
The woman - who were barely conscious during the rescue - had been swimming in Inganess Bay, Orkney, when they got into difficulties.
It is understood both woman, who were in their 20s, had been on a night out when the drama they ventured into the sea.
Mr Corse said: &quot;I knew that if I didn't go out, it would have been a different outcome.
&quot;All the training comes into play in the moment and you just do it.&quot;
John Hope, Coastguard commander for Orkney and Shetland, said only Mr Corse's &quot;stamina and bravery&quot; prevented a tragedy.
He added: &quot;These girls were seconds from death. They were beat - jiggered. They were being carried out and there was nothing they could do about it.
&quot;I think they know that now. They have recovered and realised the seriousness of the situation. They know that they couldn't have made it back on their own.&quot;

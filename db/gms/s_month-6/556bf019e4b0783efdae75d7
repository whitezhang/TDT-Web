A BILL which aims to change Scotland's transplant laws will be launched tomorrow at Holyrood.Glasgow Labour MSP Anne McTaggart will present her Transplantation (Authorisation of Removal of Organs) Scotland Bill to parliament.The bill proposes to introduce a soft opt-out system, where the default position is that everyone is considered a donor but the right to say no is respected.It was launched on the back of the Evening Times' award-winning Opt for Life campaign.Major charities including the British Heart Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, the Scottish Kidney Federation and the Scottish Youth Parliament will attend the launch together with organ recipients and patients who are on the transplant list.Support for the 'soft' opt-out system, where family are consulted, in Scotland is believed to be at 70%. Many transplant doctors are understood to be privately in favour of the change to help drive up donation rates.Research by the Evening Times has indicated that more than half of MSPs would back the change.Ms McTaggart said: &quot;I'm delighted to be able to formally introduce my Bill to the Scottish Parliament. It's been a lengthy journey and there's still a long way to go in the legislative process but I'm confident that the overwhelming evidence in favour of my proposals will ensure the success of my Bill.&quot;With three people dying every day across the UK while waiting for a transplant, it's vital that we introduce a 'soft opt-out system' in order to increase the supply of available organs for transplant and save people's lives.&quot;The event should be a great opportunity for successful transplant patients, those still waiting on a transplant, medical professionals and other interested parties to come together to mark the formal launch of the Bill and I hope that it will be a resounding success.For Scotland alone, in 2013/14 38 people died whilst waiting for a transplant.International data shows that an opt-out system is associated with higher donation rates, and several studies suggest that it would increase the numbers of organs available for transplantation by up to 30% in the UK.On December 1, Wales will become the first country in the UK to adopt an opt-out transplant system.

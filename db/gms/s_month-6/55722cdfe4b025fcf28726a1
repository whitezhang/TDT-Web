THE hunt is on a for a mystery lottery winner who still hasn’t claimed a &pound;3million prize.
A giant gold &pound;3M was dropped into animal enclosures at Stirling’s Blair Drummond Safari Park today as National Lottery chiefs tried to track down the missing punter.
The unwitting winner is sitting on a &pound;3,062,272 fortune – but only has until Monday to claim the jackpot.
The ticket was bought in the Stirling Council area and matched five numbers and the bonus ball in the Lotto quadruple rollover draw on December 17 last year.
 

The winning numbers that day were 2, 19, 24, 33, 35, 46 and the bonus ball was 12.
A National Lottery spokesman said: “We’ve been searching for this missing winner for five months but as yet we’ve had no luck. With the ticket expiry date looming, we’re giving it one final push to find the mystery millionaire.
“While there is still time, there is still hope.
“Considering that going on safari is one of the top things on lottery winners’ bucket lists, partnering up with Blair Drummond Safari Park was a natural fit.
“We hope this activity will help jog people’s memories, as someone who bought their ticket in Stirling could be heading off on a luxury safari or another adventure of a lifetime is they claim in time.”

If no one comes forward with the winning ticket before the deadline, the prize money plus all the interest it has generated will go to help National Lottery-funded projects across the UK.
Anyone who believes they have the winning ticket should call 0845 910 0000.

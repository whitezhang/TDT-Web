RANGERS fans are expected to wait until Monday to find out the results of a shareholder vote on the Â£5 million Mike Ashley loan and retail links to Sports DirectThe general meeting yesterday was called by Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley, who did not attend, to demand the repayment of a &pound;5million loan.A total of 500 shareholders, who turned up to see director Paul Murray chair proceedings at the front of the Bill Struth stand as he stood in for club chairman Dave King, had their say on the repayment as well as a resolution calling for retail links with Sports Direct - which currently sees 75 per cent of profitsfrom shirt and merchandise sales go to Ashley - to be renegotiated.That figure would drop to 49 per cent if Rangers wereto repay the cash theyhave borrowed from the tycoon.The results of the shareholder vote are expected to be announced on Monday.Despite being invited to address the vote by the Rangers board, no-one from MASH Holdings, the company which holds Ashley's 8.92 per cent shareholding in the club, made the journey to Glasgow.Murray told the meeting: &quot;MASH was asked if it would send a representative to today's meeting. No reply was has been received on that point.&quot;The board are surprised that having called a meeting have not seen fit to attend and explain themselves.&quot;It would appear MASH sees no reason to explain its conduct.&quot;Ashley went to the High Court in London on Thursday to take out an injunction gagging the Gers directors from revealing &quot;confidential&quot; details of the club's controversial commercial deal with Sports Direct.That left Murray, fellow director John Gilligan and company secretary James Blair to rebuff many of the questions they faced from shareholders.Murray said: &quot;Keeping shareholders and supporters in the dark is not something the directors are comfortable with but we must respect the decision of the courts.&quot;We will therefore have to refer any such queries to Sports Direct.&quot;Gilligan did reveal that the directors had been served with the injunctions by sheriff officers to their homes on Thursday night.Murray, who confirmed the club hopes to appoint a new manager early next week, also insisted the board was still &quot;confident&quot; it would be able to have Rangers listed on the ISDX market followingtheir expulsion from the AIM stock exchange three months ago.And he outlined plans to introduce a ban on the voting rights of shareholders at this year's AGM if they were found to put the club at risk of breaching SFA rules.That follows the &pound;5500 fine issued to Rangers by Hampden chiefs after the previous board broke &quot;dual-ownership&quot; regulations by allowing Ashley to get involved at Ibrox.Ashley's resolution also called for details of the loans given to the club by the Three Bears - Park, Letham and Taylor - to be laid bare.Murray said the &pound;1.5m sum handed over just days after King took control of the club were &quot;interest-free&quot; with no fees attached.

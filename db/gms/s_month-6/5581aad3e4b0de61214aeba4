T IN THE PARK organisers have announced a new raft of acts who will play the BBC Introducing stage at this year’s festival.
The weekender, which takes place at Strathallan Castle for the first time, will see a number of breakthrough acts taking part including BDY_PRTS, Cassels, Clubs., Dead Ceremony, Dive In, Love Nor Money, Man of Moon, Miaoux Miaoux, Monogram, Neon Waltz, Peur, Pinact, RedFaces, Stillhound, SYKES, The Xcerts, TONGUES, Vukovi and Yr Eira.
With just over three weeks to go until this year’s festival gets underway at its brand new home, T in the Park is preparing to make its Strathallan Castle debut over10th-12th July 2015.
Caithness band Neon Waltz penned a deal with Atlantic Records earlier this year.
They released their debut First Light earlier this year after locking themselves away in a croft for months of intense writing, the band celebrated a top 10 spot in the Official Vinyl Album Chart alongside records from the legendary Pink Floyd and The Stone Roses.
First playing T in the Park in 2011, The Xcerts return to the BBC Introducing stage once again, this time to headline on the Saturday night.
The four piece rock outfit, from Aberdeen , have supported bands including Brand New and Manchester Orchestra in recent years.
Since they first made their T in the Park debut on the T Break Stage in 2012, Vukovi have attracted plaudits from the likes of Kerrang! and Clash magazines for their anthemic rock sound.
Dive In released their EP Eighteen - packed with sparkling synths and huge hooks – last month.
Also appearing will be Kent’s Dead Ceremony, Oxfordshire brothers Cassels, Sheffield four-piece RedFaces and South London indie, pop band SYKES.
Yr Eira have exploded onto the Welsh music scene in the past year and will also take to the stage, as will Man of Moon, who were selected as NME’s Buzz Band of the Week last month.
Glasgow’s music scene will be represented through the likes of the indie dance pop of producer Miaoux Miaoux, Pinact, Monogram, alt-pop duo BDY_PRTS and TONGUES.
Also on the bill are Leicester’s hotly tipped Clubs, pop trio Love Nor Money and alternative rockers Peur and electro act Stillhound.

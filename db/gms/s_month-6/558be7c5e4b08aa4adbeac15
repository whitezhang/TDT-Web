Grant to help repair Mackintosh's Hill HouseA US cultural organisation is donating &pound;95,000 to help fund conservation work on one of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's finest buildings.The Getty Foundation announced details of the grant today, following an appeal by the National Trust in Scotland which said &pound;2.5m was needed to help save the 111-year-old Hill House building in Helensburgh from “excessive water ingress”.The award, which comes through the Los Angeles-based Foundation’s Keeping it Modern architectural conservation grants initiative, is the first made to a building in the UK.Chief executive of the National Trust for Scotland Simon Skinner described it as an &quot;exceptional act of generosity by the Getty Foundation for an exceptional building.&quot;He added: &quot;Last year’s events at the Glasgow School of Art were a salutary reminder of the preciousness and importance to architecture of Mackintosh’s remaining buildings.&quot;Although many of the conservation challenges at Hill House stem from the original specifications, we are obliged for the sake of Scotland’s heritage to ensure that this striking and wholly innovative property is brought to the best possible condition for future generations to enjoy.&quot;The Getty Foundation’s grant allows us to materially progress our conservation plan for Hill House.&quot;The house, built for publisher Walter Blackie in 1902, is regarded as the architect's most accomplished domestic endeavour.The trust, which has cared for the building for more than 30 years, said Mackintosh made use of &quot;innovative&quot; building techniques to create the beautiful, minimalist exterior design.Because as he did not use traditional weathering material, over the years damp has damaged the structure.Director of Conservation Terry Levinthal said the trust had agreed a strategy for repairing the building, admittedly at a &quot;significant cost&quot;.He launched formal fundraising plans at the weekend and is asking for wealthy donors to step forward and help.Among the building's many international admirers is actor Brad Pitt who visited the site four years ago during the filming of World War Z.The star later agreed to become patron of the appeal to restore Mackintosh's iconic Glasgow School of Art building following last year's blaze that damaged the building.

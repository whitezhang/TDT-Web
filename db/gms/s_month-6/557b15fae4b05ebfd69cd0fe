A teenage girl who had been missing for almost a week has been found &quot;safe and well&quot; in central Glasgow, police have said.
Brogan Mearns, 13, had not been seen after leaving for a walk from her father's house in the Castlemilk area of the city last Saturday. 
Police Scotland had expressed concern for her wellbeing.
The force said on Friday that the teenager had been traced in Glasgow city centre.

Labour must reach to the people warns MathesonIf Labour turns in on itself it will be “doomed” Gordon Matheson has warned.In a hustings even in Glasgow the city council leader who is standing for the deputy leader of the Labour party said it had to be relevant to the people.Almost 200 party members were at the Emirates Arena in the east end to hear from the candidates.Mr Matheson is contesting the deputy post with Cowdenbeath MSP, Alex Rowley and North East MSP Richard Baker.Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh are in a two way contest to replace Jim Murphy as leader.Mr Matheson said he was the candidate with the passion, drive and record of success to be deputy leader.&quot;He said the party’s values of Equality and opportunity for all need to be presented to the people.However he warned that people did not view Labour as being on their side.Mr Matheson said: “Sometimes we give a good impression of being more interested in ourselves than the people of Scotland.“We’ve got to change. Turn in on ourselves and we’re doomed.”He added: “Let’s use this campaign to remind ourselves why we joined the Labour Party in the first place.“But let’s keep our focus on the lives of the people of Scotland.”Mr Rowley said Labour had to be seen as the left wing party of Home Rule and he warned there will be another referendum on independence.He said: “There is no hiding the fact May was a disaster.“We need to give the people of Scotland a reason to vote Labour.We need to develop a radical agenda.”In response to a question from a former MP, Anne McGuire, that Labour spend too much time on the constitution and not on Labour’s previous successes, he said it could not be ignored.She said: “We have allowed the irrationality of a movement to overshadow our achievements.“How do we hold the SNP to account instead of allowing them to pull us on to their ground, the constitutional issue.”However Mr Rowley said the constitutional issue was not resolved and Labour had to prepare for another referendum.He said: “Were not going to win elections talking about what we’ve done, but we need to talk about what we are going to do.”He added: “The constitutional debate has not gone away.“We will have a referendum it’s not a question of if but when. The 45% is nearer to 50% now.”Mr Baker said he wanted to be the voice of members in the Labour Party.He said: “People did see the SNP as the party of change in May. In 2016 and 2017 we need to show we are the reformers.”“People wanted change they were tired of Westminster and they saw the SNP as that change.”He said he wanted to give local government more tools and get back to grassroots campaigning.The SNP was seen as a successful campaign movement which drew in activists across a wide spectrum.Mr Matheson said that Labour had to campaign all year round in communities not only when seats were up for grabs.He said: “ We can no longer be a party that builds up campaign either side of an election then collapses it.Need to join local campaigns. Need to have communities that feel empowered.”

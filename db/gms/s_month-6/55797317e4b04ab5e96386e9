POLICE are warning members of the public to stay away from a WWII bomblet that washed up on a remote beach.A member of the public is understood to have been prodding the cylindrical device after it was found on Scaur at Kirkcolm, near Stranraer on Wednesday June 10.The phosphorus shell then began to &quot;fizz&quot; and &quot;burn&quot; according to one officer, before the man took off.Police have now warned the public to stay away from any more small bombs that may wash ashore.A spokesman from Dumfries and Galloway police said: &quot;Every now and then when you get one, you get two or three for whatever reason, sometimes a box has been disturbed.&quot;Our fear is that there are others and people, particularly kids , will want to go and see what it is.&quot;Our message is that if you see one of them, note where it is and give us a call on 101.&quot;It is thought the shell may have come from Beaufort's Dyke, a 50km trench between Northern Ireland and Scotland which holds a large amount of disused chemical munitions.Although the risk of one of the devices exploding is low, the gas given off by them can be dangerous to the public.A police spokesman said: &quot;It wouldn't do you much good to breath it in, it is a toxic gas it gives off and it burns very brightly as it's phosphorus, it's a very bright heat.&quot;

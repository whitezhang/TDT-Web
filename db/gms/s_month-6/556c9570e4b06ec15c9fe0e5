Three people have been arrested after a ticket collector and another man were stabbed on board a train.
The incident happened as the 14:54 Largs to Glasgow Central service approached West Kilbride station in Ayrshire at about 15:05 on Sunday.
The ticket collector, who is 43, is in a stable condition in hospital. Another man, 40, was treated by paramedics.
British Transport Police (BTP) said two men, aged 21 and 35, and a 26-year-old woman had been arrested.
All three are expected to appear at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court on Monday.
BTP said the train was held at West Kilbride while emergency services dealt with the incident.
The ticket examiner is being treated at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock. The other victim was treated for a minor injury to his body but he did not need to attend hospital.
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: &quot;We do not tolerate crime on the railway and we are fully co-operating with British Transport Police in their investigation.&quot;

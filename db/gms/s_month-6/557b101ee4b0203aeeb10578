A 13-year-old girl who had been missing for six days has been found safe and well.
Brogan Mearns disappeared after telling her father she was going for a walk.
She was last seen at about 6pm on Saturday at her father's home in Tormusk Road in the Castlemilk area of Glasgow.
 Her family issued a desperate plea for information earlier this week as concern grew for Brogan's wellbeing. 
Police said she was found safe and well in Glasgow city centre this afternoon.
Officers thanked the media and the public for their help.

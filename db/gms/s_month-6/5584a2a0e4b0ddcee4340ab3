STUNNING footage of Glasgow from the air has been filmed, showcasing the city’s beauty from the skies.
The two-and-a-half minute video, uploaded to YouTube by Stuart Hatch, offers viewers a glimpse into the daily life of dear old Glasgow town.
A number of Glasgow’s iconic monuments are included in the video, which was filmed using a Phantom drone.
Viewers will no doubt recognise Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Waverley paddle-steamer, the Finnieston crane, the SSE Hydro concert venue and the University of Glasgow.
Also making an appearance are the Clyde Auditorium - or ‘Armadillo’ - and George Square.
The headquarters of BBC Scotland, Pacific Quay, can be spotted as well as the River Clyde itself and the Tall Ship and Riverside Museum.

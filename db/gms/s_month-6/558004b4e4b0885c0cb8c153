A PARKING attendant was injured outside a school yesterday after being knocked down by an angry driver.
Witnesses claimed the man was deliberately targeted while clearing illegally parked cars.
Police were last night hunting the motorist, who sped from the scene.
The attendant was taken to hospital with minor injuries after the incident, which happened outside St John’s Primary School in Edinburgh’s Portobello.
 A source said the victim was dealing with problem parkers during the peak drop-off time shortly before 9am when a motorist in a people carrier  drove at him. 
The witness said: “The ‘keep clear’ areas are there to make sure pupils have as safe a route to school as possible, but some parents just ignore it.
“The attendant had cleared someone away from the area when he spotted a people carrier doing exactly the same thing further up the road.
&quot;When he moved towards it, the motorist aimed their car at him as if to scare him, but then hit him instead, throwing him against the railings and then hitting him with the wing mirror.
 

“He was taken to hospital and should be OK but he is really shaken up.
“Parking attendants are used to getting abuse, but this is just beyond belief.
“The driver sped away – and if there had been a kid crossing, they’d have had no chance.”
Police Scotland confirmed they are investigating the incident and appealed for any witnesses to contact them.
A spokeswoman said: “Police received a report of a road traffic collision involving a car and a pedestrian on Hamilton Terrace at around 9am on Monday.
“A man sustained minor injuries and officers are eager to trace the owner of the vehicle to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident.”

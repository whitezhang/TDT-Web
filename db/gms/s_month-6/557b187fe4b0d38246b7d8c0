GLASGOW could see a raft of new radio stations launch as a result of an Ofcom trial.Listeners in ten areas around the country will benefit from new DAB digital stations.Around 60 stations will begin broadcasting on digital radio for the first time using 'small scale DAB'.The new approach could provide a more affordable way for smaller stations to broadcast on DAB digital radio.Scrimshaws Information Directories will bringYour Radio, Celtic Music Radio, Pulse FM and Go Radio to Glasgow.If the trials are successful, UK listeners could benefit from hundreds more local and community radio stations on digital radio in the future.Ofcom has awarded ten trial licences for radio 'multiplexes' - discrete chunks of the airwaves used to broadcast several radio services.This will enable groups of community, online and local commercial radio stations to work together and bring new stations to areas including Glasgow.The stations are expected to begin broadcasting on DAB digital radio from the summer for a period of nine months.Each successful applicant now has 12 weeks to launch their multiplex.Peter Davies, Ofcom Director of Content Policy, said: &quot;There's been huge interest in these trials, which are another step in bringing new local services to digital radio listeners.&quot;Ofcom is helping unlock the potential of this new approach and, if it proves successful, millions of radio listeners could benefit right across the UK.&quot;

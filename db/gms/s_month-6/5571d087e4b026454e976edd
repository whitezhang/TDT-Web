IT looks like some high jinks have gone wrong in Greenock!
The man in a cycle helmet tries to use a children’s trampoline to vault a three-foot fence in a back garden.
Wearing just his jeans and a grass skirt, he backs out of the first two attempts as he hasn’t jumped high enough.

His pals erupt in laughter as they film the scene nearby.

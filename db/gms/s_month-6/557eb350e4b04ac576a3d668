A LOCKERBIE disaster hero who found love with a victim’s mum is to have his ashes scattered back home after dying in America.
George White, who was 83, was a paramedic in Lockerbie on the night of the PanAm 103 bombing in December 1988.
He tended the body of American student Suzanne Miazga, 22, after she fell to earth near his ambulance depot.
George later planted a rose in Suzanne’s memory and wrote to her mum Anna Marie in upstate New York.
Anna Marie visited Lockerbie and became close friends with George and his wife Elma.
 And after Elma died in 2002, George found love again with Anna Marie. He died in her  arms in the US last month after suffering from cancer. 
Anna Marie, 77, said: “George was the angel who tended the body of a stranger, my daughter. Neither of us knew then that his actions would lead to the great love we came to share.
“We had 10 good years together and travelled the world. All I have now are wonderful memories of a very special man.
“I was able to hold him at the end and say goodbye. We had planned to return to Scotland on June 27 for his grand-daughter’s wedding, but that was not to be.”
Anne Marie and George fell in love three years after Elma’s death, when he flew to New York for a visit.
 

She said: “We knew almost immediately that we were meant to be together.”
George’s son George jnr, who lives in Clinton, New York, will bring half his ashes home and lay them to rest near the Lockerbie disaster memorial at Dryfesdale Cemetery in the town.
 The rest will remain at Holy Trinity Cemetery in Utica, New York, where Anne Marie can  visit her husband. 
As well as George jnr, George is survived by daughters Audrey and Cilla, who still lives in Lockerbie.

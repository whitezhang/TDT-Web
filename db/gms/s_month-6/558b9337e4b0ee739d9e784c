A major investigation is now underway into the cause of the contamination.John Wilson MSP yesterday asked the Scottish Government when the public could expect to get answers.He asked: &quot;Given the level of disruption and inconvenience caused to the local population, especially the vulnerable and those with young children, what provisions is Scottish Water taking to ensure that such an incident does not happen again? How can it ensure that it gets back the full confidence of the population of the area as far as their water supplies are concerned?Transport Minister Derek Mackay said there was no timescale for the publication of the report.He said he had met with Scottish Water but was as yet unable to discuss further details of the issue but pledged that the govenrment would take any action that is required.He said: &quot;Water quality is, of course, of the highest importance.&quot;I can inform the chamber that I was in Scottish Waterâ€™s national control centre just this morning, when I asked questions about the incident.&quot;We will be able to take further action once we have learned what caused the contamination.&quot;That is why an intensive investigation is under way to establish the cause. That will inform us as to what further actions are necessary. We will, of course, take any action that is required.&quot;The key issue now is to identify the cause and minimise the risk that is happens again.&quot;

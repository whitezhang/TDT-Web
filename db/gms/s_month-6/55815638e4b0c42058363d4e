A GANG blew a hole in a furniture store wall then tried to crack a safe holding &pound;60,000.
 The thieves targeted a room containing the safe, which held the weekend’s takings. 
But it’s thought they were disturbed by the night manager of The Range superstore in Edinburgh when he responded to an alarm.
Police said they could not reveal whether anything had been taken from the store – the former Big W – in Newcraighall.
It’s not known what the gang used to blow the hole in the wall.
 Detective Inspector Alan O’Brien said: “We are appealing for witnesses following a break-in at The Range store in the east of Edinburgh. 
“Thieves broke in through an external wall in the early hours of Monday morning.
“I would ask anyone  who noticed any unusual behaviour in this area of Newcraighall to please get in touch with police on the 101 number or alternatively the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.”
A spokesperson for The Range said no one was  available to comment on the break-in.
 The crime has shades of the Hatton Garden jewellery heist in London. 
Nine men have charged after a gang spent the  Easter weekend drilling through thick concrete to get at gems in safety deposit boxes.
It’s believed jewellery worth &pound;200million was taken in that raid.

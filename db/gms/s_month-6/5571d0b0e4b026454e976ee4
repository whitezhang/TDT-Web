 Veteran broadcaster James Naughtie has apologised after referring to Caitlyn Jenner as &quot;he&quot; during a discussion on Radio 4's flagship Today programme. 
 The American celebrity formerly known as Bruce made her debut as a transgender woman called Caitlyn in Vanity Fair earlier this week. 
In just four hours she had gained a million followers on Twitter as images of the front cover photoshoot by Annie Leibovitz - showing long-haired Jenner in a strapless corset, legs crossed, sitting on a stool - went viral.
Jenner has previously talked of preferring the use of &quot;he&quot; but tweeted: &quot;'I'm so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self. Welcome to the world Caitlyn. Can't wait for you to get to know her/me.&quot;
During a discussion on Today, Naughtie said: &quot;Now, this is complicated. He used to be called Bruce but he's now a woman. I realise some of you will never have heard of Kim Kardashian, let alone her stepfather, who was Bruce and is now a woman but, anyway, they are very well known on television.&quot;
 

He added: &quot;There's not a million people going on because they are interested in discussing transgender issues, surely. They are on it because he/she is a celebrity.&quot;
Naughtie was criticised on Twitter for referring to Jenner as he.
Fat Jacques wrote: &quot;Can someone explain to Jim Naughtie what mis-gendering is. He did it to Caitlyn Jenner several times this morning.&quot;
Catherine tweeted &quot;not heard reporting that bad about a trans person in a long time&quot; while Deptford Dame wrote: &quot;James Naughtie struggling a bit on BBC Radio 4 Today with his transgender references. Need to try harder than 'he/she' Jim!&quot;
Naughtie later apologised, writing: &quot;If Caitlyn Jenner wishes to be known as she, of course she's entitled to that, and I'm sorry for saying 'he' on air. A bit sloppy.&quot;

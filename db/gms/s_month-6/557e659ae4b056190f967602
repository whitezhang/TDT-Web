EX-THIRD Lanark players have reunited at their home ground for the first time in almost 50 years.The past players took time to visit their old home pitch, Cathkin Park, before attending the club's annual dinner at the No10 Hotel on Saturday.Club director, Pat McGeady, organised the &quot;emotional&quot; event to give the players, including Mike Jackson, George Fyfe and, the team's last captain, Alan McKay, the opportunity to re-live their finest moments together again - a tradition which Mr McGeady is determined to maintain almost 48 years after the club went under.Mr McGeady said: &quot;It is great to see the players have a chance to get back to Cathkin.&quot;The team was a big part of their lives and they have made a lot of friends there.&quot;This has brought a lot of players together who have not seen each other in years .&quot;The players are all applauded and given a standing ovation as they walk in.&quot;It is important for them to know people have not forgotten and are still interested in them.&quot;I always look forward to the event and the player's stories, I absolutely love the stories and every year there are stories I have never heard before, everyone loves that.&quot;It was a sold out event, whatever we are doing were are doing right and as long as there is a Third Lanark player alive there will be a dinner. &quot;Former player, Matt Gray, was &quot;delighted&quot; to attend the event and, as the most expensive player to be sold, place the cheque that he received from Manchester City for &pound;20,000 to help the club's dream of returning to a professional level.The 78-year-old from Renfrew said: &quot;It is brilliant, I love it - I loved the idea of going back.&quot;I feel great that people still remember us.&quot;It was a great club, it was a family sort of and with a real loyal support.&quot;I did not even know the cheque still existed until Pat presented it to me at the last dinner but it is better for them to make money from it than it sitting in my wallet.&quot;Anything that help the team, I will do.&quot;The happiest days of my life were playing with Third Lanark even with all the trouble.&quot;

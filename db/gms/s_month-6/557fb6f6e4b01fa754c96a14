THE Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is offering a group of teenagers the chance to launch their dance and drama careers.Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Kelvin College have teamed up with the world-class performing arts institution to provide 12 Glasgow teenagers the chance to build careers in the arts.A new initiative, Creative Pathways, is recruiting S6 pupils to take part in a year-long pilot which will see them attend college and gain work experience at the conservatoire, supporting dance and drama groups - all whilst still at school.The scheme aims to support the youngsters into employment or further training by enabling them to gain experience and qualifications, including Modern Apprenticeships.Mentors will help the students throughout, with pupils spending two afternoons a week at Glasgow Kelvin College and one at the Conservatoire working with dance and drama groups.Andrew Comrie, Director of Academic Innovation at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland said:&quot;The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland embraces inclusivity and is passionate about ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to realise their potential.&quot;We are delighted to be working with partners Glasgow City Council and Glasgow Kelvin College to deliver this creative opportunity which enables young people in Glasgow to take positive first steps into the performing arts and explore its potential for work or further study.&quot;He continued: &quot; We look forward very much to working with the first group of young people this August and hope this ground-breaking experience will give them a worthwhile and first-hand insight into the potential for future work or study within the performing arts.&quot;The closing date for applications is Thursday June 18 with the programme set to start in August.Glasgow City council is backing the project and hopes to continue its development.Abigail Kinsella, principal officer, employment and skills partnership team - education services at Glasgow CityCouncil said: &quot;This pilot aims to increase the numbers of young people accessing industry-recognised, national qualifications while they are still at school, as part of their senior phase of secondary education, building experience of the work place as they do so.&quot;We are delighted to have helped establish a creative pathway for young Glaswegians to get on in the arts in a city renowned for its culture and creativity.&quot;

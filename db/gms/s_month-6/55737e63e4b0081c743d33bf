FOUR children and an adult have been injured when an inflatable slide was blown into a crowd at a gala day.
Emergency services were called to Duffus Park in Cupar, Fife, at around 2.15pm after high winds carried the slide around 150 yards.
The youngest child injured was six, and the adult and one youngster were taken to hospital for tests.
The organisers of the Cupar Children's Gala said the circumstances of the incident were being investigated.

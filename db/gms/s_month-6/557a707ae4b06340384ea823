THE marvellous Mela could be on the move from Kelvingrove Park.On Sunday, around 40,000 people are expected to turn up to help the festival celebrate its 25th anniversary.But organisers are already considering moving the event next year to a park elsewhere in the city.Unlike most parks, Kelvingrove has rolling hills making it difficult to find a flat space large enough to allow the Mela to grow.As a result, Glasgow Life which organises the annual celebration of Asian culture, is believed to be considering moving it to Glasgow Green, Pollok or Bellahouston parks.Soryia Siddique, chairwoman of the Glasgow Mela steering group, attended her first Mela around 15 years ago and is firm fan.She said: &quot;My first memory was attending it with my family. I remember it being very much part of the yearly calendar - something you really looked forward to.&quot;You spent lots of your parents' money, enjoyed the music, the different stalls and the atmosphere. I wish you could capture the atmosphere and bottle it.&quot;In previous years, groups from Africa, China, Turkey and Greek have performed at the Mela and that is a trend which is set to continue.Soryis said: &quot;We I find is people attend the Mela, have a great time and say they want to be involved.&quot;We are listening to them and have been approached by lots of people from the Afro-Carribbean, Roma and Pakistani backgrounds whowant to be part of this celebration of diversity.&quot;This year for the first time Mela on your Doorstep events were held in Barmulloch and the Tramway to give more people a taste of the magic of the Mela.Some of the local acts which appeared at Mela on Your Doorstep events managed to secure funding to continue rehearsing and as a result, will be able to appear at the Mela on Sunday.Soryia said: &quot;The Glasgow Mela has grown and changed over the last 25 years but it has never strayed from its core purpose of reflecting Glasgow's rich and diverse communities.&quot;No-one who worked at the original Mela could have imagined just how it would grow to become such a familiar part of the city's cultural calendar which is enjoyed by thousands of people each year.&quot;This anniversary will be extra special as we celebrate through art and culture Glasgow's friendliness and inclusiveness.&quot;Heading the bill on Sunday will be The Dhol Foundation and the Red Hot Chilli Pipers who will be performing together for the first time.Jonny Kalsi from The Dhol Foundation said: &quot;The Dhol Foundation are very excited about performing with the effervescent Red Hot Chilli Pipers.&quot;The rehearsal was such an amazing collaboration and the guys were all wired after a run through.&quot;Previous performances in Glasgow Melas have always been amazing and we'll pack some London sunshine to bring to the festival. We can't wait to get up to Glasgow to perform.&quot;Also performing on Sunday will be Abhinaya, Sacred Paws, Dance Ihayami, Sain Tanveer Brothers, Celtic Belles, Asian Deaf Club and Jamaican Dub poet Yasus Afari alongside many more.Sain Tanveer Brothers performance has been supported by the Lord Provost's office recognising Glasgow's twin city of Lahore in Pakistan. British Sign Language interpreters will work with announcers at the Kelvingrove Bandstand and at the Main Stage on Sunday.Food from across the world, made with some of the finest Scottish ingredients will also be part of the Glasgow Mela 25th anniversary celebrations.As part of Scotland's Year of Food and Drink, organisers are working with 20 traders to bring some outstanding examples of world food cultures to the event.Visitors will be able to sample the very best pakora and satay, authentic curries, plantain chips, superfood salads, burritos, Thai green curry, wood fired pizza, crepes, Cullen skink, stovies and buffalo burgers as well as much more.Halal vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options will also be available and clearly signposted and many outlets will offer children's choices at reduced prices.

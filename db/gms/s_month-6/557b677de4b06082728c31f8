 SCOTLAND was today named the binge drinking capital of the UK. 
An Office for National Statistics study of drinking habits found 36 per cent of adults in Scotland binged at least once in the previous seven days.
In the West Midlands, the figure dipped to 22 per cent, while in Wales it was 24 per cent.
 The results come only days after the Record told how holidaymakers were ignoring Magaluf’s new booze ban designed to stop bingeing Brits. 
 And on Thursday, we told how Scot Jenna McAlpine – who plunged 15ft from her apartment in the resort – could face a &pound;1000 fine under their crackdown on yobbish behaviour. 
Despite the worrying level of binge drinking in Scotland, the ONS found that it had fallen by a third between 2005 and 2013 across the UK.
And the study said 16 to 24-year-olds were now as likely to describe themselves as teetotal as the over-65s.

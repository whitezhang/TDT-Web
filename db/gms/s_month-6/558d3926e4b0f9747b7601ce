Attention Harry Potter fans: JK Rowling announces new play about the boy wizard will open in 2016Harry Potter fans are set for a magical 2016 after JK Rowling announced plans for a play starring the boy wizard on Twitter. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rowling confirmed that a new play called Harry Potter and the Cursed Child will open in London in 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a collaboration between writer Jack Thorne, director John Tiffany and Rowling.She announced the latest instalment of her lucrative franchise on the 18th anniversary of the UK publication of her first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone.Today is a very special day for two reasons. Firstly, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was published in the UK 18 years ago! &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm also very excited to confirm today that a new play called Harry Potter and the #CursedChild will be opening in London next year. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It will tell a new story, which is the result of a collaboration between writer Jack Thorne, director John Tiffany and myself. #CursedChild&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rowling was tight lipped about the play's plot but said it will not be a prequel to the Harry Potter books. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't want to say too much more, because I don't want to spoil what I know will be a real treat for fans. #CursedChild &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However, I can say that it is not a prequel! #CursedChild&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also was quick to explain why the latest installment in the Harry Potter franchise will not be a book. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To answer one inevitable (and reasonable!) question - why isn't #CursedChild a new novel? - I am confident that when audiences see the play &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;they will agree that it was the only proper medium for the story. #CursedChild &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I've had countless offers to extend Harry's story over the years, but Jack, John and Sonia Friedman are a dream team! #CursedChild &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been a huge pleasure to share with them (and soon, with you!) this untold part of Harry's story. #CursedChild&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The announcement means 2016 will be a big year for Potter fans, with spin-off film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, starring Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne also hitting cinemas.&nbsp;

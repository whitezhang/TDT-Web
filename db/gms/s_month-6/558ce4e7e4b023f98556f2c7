Things that go bump in the night - paranormal activity at Govanhill BathsIF there’s something strange in your neighbourhood, who you going to call? ... Lanarkshire Paranormal, of course.The ghost busting team will perform a spooky paranormal investigation at Govanhill Baths tomorrow night and have warned punters to be afraid, very afraid.Using a full set of tools – including night vision goggles and cameras, parabolic mikes and dictaphones – the six strong team of paranormal investigators will attempt to unravel the mysteries of the baths gruesome past.30 brave souls have signed up to accompany the team in the pitch darkness from 9pm to 3am -with all ticket money going toward the baths restoration project - and the expedition leader is expecting some serious bumps in the night.Jan Murdoch-Richards has run Lanarkshire Paranormal with her husband Steff for the last five years and believes Govanhill baths presents the most exciting challenge to date.She said: “During WWII the pool was drained and used as a morgue for civilian and military personnel so it is full of paranormal activity.“We have done investigations there before so we know what to expect – The Black Shadowman is always present we have had lots of sightings of him by both the team and by members of the public so we are hoping to see him again.”“The old steamie is another part of the baths that can throw up some activity – it’s obviously a place of great history, so much would have happened there throughout the years so it will be a hotbed of the underworld.”During the overnight event members of the public will be split into teams and accompanied by two investigators but the torches they carry will light their way in the pitch darkness will offer little defence against the spirit world.Mrs Murdoch-Richards was reluctant to put first-time ghost hunters off but claims they will need to be prepared to face their ultimate fears.Though the team take their work as seriously as Spengler and Venkman they do see the funny side of what they do – especially when it comes to blood-curdling screams.”We have had stones thrown at us, we have heard bumps and bangs - we even had one of our team members being slapped by something.“We were moving through the area and we just heard a thump and one of our guys let out a huge scream. We shouldn’t laugh but sometimes it can be very funny. We have video on our Facebook showing it.”“People report the feeling of being watched and followed from the shadows so it really is a frightening experience in the baths, not for the faint hearted and the men definitely shout louder than the woman that’s for sure.”Lanarkshire Paranormal has investigated historic sites throughout Scotland, including at the request of the National Trust of Scotland.The team examined the David Livingstone Centre last year and found it teeming with mysterious, unexplainable energies.They will return in August to once more commune with the dead.Mrs Murdoch-Richards is keen to stress that despite the reputation of TV psychic mediums like Derek Acorah her company does not stage any of the activity that isn’t real - imagined or not.She said: “There won’t be anyone jumping out at you shouting and screaming.&quot;What happens is really what happens – we don’t stage anything at all.”The event, which will raise nearly &pound;1000 toward the restoration of the baths, is sold-out but the Mrs Murdoch-Richards says anyone brave enough to take part should contact her about potential cancellations.Thrill-seeking fans will have another opportunity to connect with other-side on August 1 when the team undertake another extreme and gory investigation at The Tron Theatre.Mrs Murdoch-Richards said: “The Tron Theatre is next on our list and we can’t wait.&quot;People used to be hanged in the building so it’s bound to have lots going on in terms spirits and the paranormal.“Staff have already reported hearing spirits in the auditorium, kitchen, bar and boiler room so we will set-up all our kit and try and catch some on tape.”“We have built a really good following on Facebook and Twitter and we see some regular people coming back on the tours – they are gluttons for punishment but it really is great fun.”

A CAMPSITE close to where John Lennon used to spend every summer has made it on to the list of Scotland’s top places to park a tent.
Leading travel guide Wanderlust placed Sango Sands at Durness in Sutherland in its seven top camp sites north of the border.
Lennon used to stay nearby working on his cousins’ croft.
Durness was regularly visited by Beatles singer-songwriter during his summer holidays between the ages of 9 and 15.
He later returned in 1969 with his wife Yoko Ono and their children.
During the trip, the family had a car accident near Loch Eriboll. Lennon received 17 stitches for facial injuries, while Ono received 14 stitches in her forehead.
Lennon is believed to have used the area as part of the inspiration for the song In My Life - the village has a Lennon memorial garden - and he even once considered buying the Durness estate to return to the UK from New York.
Sango Sands made it in seventh place on Wanderlust’s best camping spots in Scotland.
“Sango Sands teeters on the northern edge of Britain in glorious fashion – and has a view out to infinity. 
Its unique north-facing location at the very top of Scotland means that in summer you can watch the sun both rise and set over the ocean. 
That is if you aren’t lying in your sleeping bag, exhausted from the outdoor adventuring that is compulsory in this wild and windswept corner of the land,” said Wanderlust.
“Durness may be remote but there’s a lot to do. 
A few miles west is the aptly named Cape Wrath, which you can visit by catching a ferry and then a minibus – there’s a lighthouse, the highest sea cliffs in Britain and a thrilling sense of freedom. 
Then you can return to your tent on its cliff-top eyrie and stay awake for that sunset.”
Wanderlust said that “from serene loch-side pitches to rugged cliff-top spots, Scotland is full of incredible camp sites.”

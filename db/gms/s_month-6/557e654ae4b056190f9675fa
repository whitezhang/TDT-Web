TWO Glasgow projects have been shortlisted for a share of a new Â£2.5million fund set up by the Royal Bank of Scotland.Homelessness charities Moving On and The Marie Trust are both in the running for a share of the Skills and Opportunities fund.It is dedicated to supporting projects in disadvantaged communities which help people to help themselves by learning new skills, getting into the world of work or setting up their own business.The fund launched inMay and in only two weeks attracted 1066 applications for funding from across the UK.Thom Kenrick, head of community programmes, RBS Sustainability said: &quot;We expected the response to be good but have been bowled over by the volume of applications.&quot;Pulling together a shortlist from so many fantastic projects was a real challenge. We expect people will have a hard time selecting their regional favourites from such a strong line-up.&quot;The public have one week to vote for their favourite project in each of seven regions across the UK and Ireland. The results of the public vote will count as one vote alongside those from a panel of judges in each region, deciding who receives funding in July this year.Ken Barclay, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland's Scottish board, which is judging the entries for the area, said: &quot;We have been impressed with the high standard of entries for the fund and it's been a challenging process to draw up a shortlist.I would encourage those who haven't made it through this time to try again when the fund reopens in August.&quot;It's going to be a very difficult decision now to choose the ultimate winners of this round - and that's where the public vote comes in. We want to know which organisations our communities feel could make a real difference with this funding. If it matters to the community then it matters to us.&quot;To find out more about the shortlisted projects, the organisations behind them, and to have your say on which you think should receive funding from the Skills &amp; Opportunities fund, visit skillsandopportunitiesfund.rbs.com.Voting runs from noon on Monday 15th June until noon on Friday 19th June.

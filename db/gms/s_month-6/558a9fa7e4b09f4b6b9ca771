Police to slash size of Scottish stations and share offices with councilsSCORES of police stations are to be downsized or moved into council buildings under radical plans being drawn up by Scotland's national force to save millions of pounds a year.The move comes after Police Scotland carried out its first full-scale review of the hundreds of offices inherited from the old regional services in 2013 and identified a huge surplus in bricks and mortar.Senior officials propose slashing the total floorspace of the force's offices, garages and other facilities by as much as a quarter, saving between &pound;5 million to &pound;18 million a year.Some insiders believe the new strategy will spark concerns that smaller buildings will somehow reflect less interest in policing in the areas affected.It has already faced a barrage of criticism over its decision to close some police counters, especially at night, after such facilities were barely used by the public.The force has stressed it can still maintain a meaningful presence across the country with buildings that are either smaller or shared with other public-sector bodies, such as the fire and rescue service, NHS and councils.The proposals come after chief constable Sir Stephen House warned of &quot;extreme measures&quot; to plug a financial black hole this financial year.Sir Stephen has already signalled that he believes some of the old pre-1980s HQs for old forces and divisions, such as sprawling facilities in Dumbarton and Inverness, may have to go.The old headquarters of the former Strathclyde force, at Pitt Street in Glasgow, has already been emptied and put on the market.It has been replaced by a smaller office at Dalmarnock in the east end as the new force looks likely to try and invest in such poor neighbourhoods as part of wider regeneration efforts.The new Police Scotland Estates Strategy is designed to take the force long past current financial squeeze to produce a leaner and more efficient series of buildings.The document, which is due to be presented to the force's ruling board, the Scottish Policy Authority on Wednesday, makes it clear that the national service is not looking to cut its regional or local reach.It says: &quot;More effective use of accommodation may not result in Police Scotland being located in fewer premises, but it should reduce floor space occupied by 10 per cent to 25 per cent.&quot;It is estimated that that this could generate annual revenue savings of between &pound;5m-&pound;18m.&quot;Through re-shaping the local estate there is the potential to realise capital receipts of between &pound;22m and &pound;34m.&quot;Scotland's existing police estate includes everything from its formal HQ in a mock baronial castle in Tulliallan, Fife, to the new state-of-the-art crime campus at Gartcosh, North Lanarkshire, which opened last year.In total, the police have 710 buildings or other assets, including radio masts, with a total area of half a million square metres. The figure includes 115 homes for officers, 460 operational bases, many of which are long considered surplus to requirements.Just 20 buildings, each of them with a floorspace of more than 5,000 square meters, make up two-fifths of the total estate.These may well face huge downsizing or closure as the police look to slash paper files, store evidence off sites and offer just eight desks for every 10 officers and staff.But it is the 330 smaller stations smaller than 1,000m2 that experts believe could provide real opportunities for co-location with other public services, experts believe.The new strategy outlines success stories where police already share facilities. Last year Police Scotland and the ambulance service opened a joint facility in Fort William. The force's stations in Cupar in Fife and Baillieston in Glasgow are colocated with council offices. Its hub in Livingston is part of a civic centre that also acts as a base for the West Lothian's towns court and councilSusan Mitchell, director of corporate services, who is responsible for the new strategy, said: &quot;&quot;Police Scotland needs buildings which are modern, flexible and fit for future policing across the wide range of communities we serve.&quot;The existing estate has evolved over the course of the last 100 years and in some cases it no longer fits the demands of 2015 or the needs of communities.&quot;This strategy sets out a framework which has the service to local communities at its heart, with a visible and accessible policing service that works effectively with local partners as the drivers for any future change.&quot;Ms Mitchell stressed that local policing teams would engage with local communities on estate changes.Labour MSP Graeme Pearson said: &quot;The downsizing of police stations makes sense and is long overdue given we are moving towards an Internet-based service. Much of the current estate is old and extremely costly to maintain.&quot;

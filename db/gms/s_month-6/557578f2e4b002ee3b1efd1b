 IT was Still Game set and match when the stars of Scotland’s favourite comedy teamed up to Rally For Bally in a fundraiser for the Elena Baltacha Tennis Foundation. 
 Sanjeev Kohli and Greg Hemphill joined names and faces from the worlds of sport and media for Saturday’s ace novelty event inspired by former British number one Elena who died from cancer last year aged just 30. 
 Broadcasters Kaye Adams, Judith Ralston and Alison Walker, footballers Iain McCall and Alan Rough, Balamory actress Julie Wilson Nimmo and - representing the Daily Record - yours truly, were joined on court by top coach Judy Murray. 
Elena’s husband Nino Severino joined hundreds of tennis fans to watch the comical clash at Glasgow’s Western Tennis Club which was more Wombles than Wimbledon.
The hilarious racket also netted thousands for dementia research in Scotland and Sally Magnusson’s Playlist For Life dementia charity.
Judy said: “It was a real fun match and great that so many people turned out for it. The Foundation raises money to give children in deprived areas the chance to take up tennis, something Bally was very passionate about.”
Sanj said: “I let myself down badly again, but I’ve had a lesson off Judy Murray so I’ll probably be a Williams sister by next year.”
Roughie quipped: &quot;I'm looking forward to next year's event but I think we'll need some more lessons from Judy before then.&quot;
Kaye added: “We raised a ton of cash for dementia and to bring tennis to disadvantaged kids. It was a brilliant day.”

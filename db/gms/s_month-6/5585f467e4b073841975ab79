NICOLA Sturgeon has backed the thousands of Scots who took to the streets for a mass anti-austerity rally yesterday.
The Scotland United Against Austerity event in Glasgow took place as a demonstration was staged in London.
Organisers of the London event said the protests would be the biggest for years. 
Sturgeon, addressing the STUC in Glasgow yesterday, said: “I want to offer my support to those marching with the STUC today against the harsh, deeply unfair Tory cuts that are causing real pain for many in Scotland and across the UK.
“Five years of Tory austerity has done too much damage
already; working families and vulnerable people cannot aff&shy;ord further UK government cuts. 
“At Holyrood and at Westminster, the SNP will continue to make the strong case for an alternative to austerity to 
ensure the most vulnerable people in our society do not continue to face the brunt of unfair Tory cuts.”
STUC general secretary Grahame Smith said yesterday that austerity “does not work”.
Organisers said about 75,000 people attended the march in London, which began after a rally outside the Bank of England and ended with another rally outside Parliament.
Among them were comedian Russell Brand and singer Charlotte Church, who brandished an End Austerity Now placard.
She said: “I’m here today in a show of solidarity with everyone here.”
Asked if she was inspired by the surge of the SNP, she said “absolutely”. The 29-year-old added: “But I think that the Scottish have been able to galvanise themselves against the Westminster elite.”

A MAN was arrested in possession of a knife in Paisley town centre ... after HE dialled 999 and called police.
The town’s Sheriff Court heard how David McCall, 37, rang cops to report a bogus fight, causing officers to respond.
Defence agent Rhona Lynch explained that her client had such a deeply troubled life at the time that he had set out to get himself arrested as he felt “prison would be a better place to be.”
The court had heard that when officers arrived, there was no sign of any disturbance but they thought McCall was acting suspiciously and searched him.
He was found to have the knife following the episode on February 9.
In court, the 37-year-old admitted having unlawful possession of the knife in Paisley’s High Street without reasonable excuse.
Ms Lynch conceded there were “very unusual circumstances” behind her client’s arrest and added: “He had found himself in a very dark place at the time and wanted to be arrested as he felt he would be safer in custody.”
McCall, it was said, had been introduced to criminal activity at a very young age and he “had suffered significant emotional damage as a result.”
He had gone on to struggle with depression, became dependant on drugs and had “wanted a spell in prison to get some respite from his troubled life.”
The lawyer said that, having spent a period on remand, the accused was now in a much better position to get back into the community, having detoxed and been placed on a methadone programme.
After studying numerous pages containing details of 40 previous convictions, Sheriff Robert Fife told McCall bluntly that there could only be one possible disposal for such a serious offence - imprisonment.
He jailed McCall for 15 months, backdated to February 10 when he was first taken into custody.
“Anyone seeing this knife you had in Paisley High Street would have been appalled,” he said.

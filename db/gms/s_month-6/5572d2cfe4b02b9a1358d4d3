VITOR PEREIRA has been warned to return to Olympiakos today – so the Greek champions can axe him.
Rangers’ managerial target only took over at the Karaiskakis Stadium in January and, despite leading the club to their 42nd championship, Pereira’s stint in Greece is set to end this month.
Club bosses were furious to learn that their manager had not only spoken to Rangers but had even travelled to Scotland for talks with the Ibrox board.
Portuguese Pereira has now been summoned to return today to discuss a compensation package with Olympiakos.
He helped the Piraeus club storm to the title by 12 points from Panathinaikos but cracks had already appeared between him and the board over future funding.
Despite turning down the chance to manage Rangers after they missed out on promotion to the Premiership, the Olympiakos board were furious he even opened talks with the Glasgow giants.
And it seems certain Pereira will now  be axed, with a shortlist of successors already drawn up.
Leading the list to replace him is former Roma and Zenit St Petersburg manager Luciano Spalletti.

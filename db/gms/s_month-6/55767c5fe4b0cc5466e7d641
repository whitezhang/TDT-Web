A CARER fears for her vulnerable dad's safety after trying for months to find a house closer to him.Brenda McLaughlin, 46, travels between Ibrox and Kinning Park every day to look after her 92-year-old dad who suffers from dementia.In her own home she lives with her 28-year-old epileptic son, and has to look after him too as he takes regular seizures.Each day is a struggle for Brenda, who suffers from mobility problems, as she travels back and forth between the two homes caring for her only two living relatives.The 46-year-old has been trying for at least four months to find a house closer to her dad on Glasgow Housing Association's (GHA) list.But no homes in her category, one for carers, ever seem to come up she says and now she is becoming desperate, fearing for the safety of her elderly father John who has already injured himself whilst alone at home.Brenda said: &quot;My dad fell and cracked his head about a month and a half ago, the doctor had to come out and cleaned the wound, made sure he was okay.&quot;He's walked out too into the street, wandering.&quot;It was lucky the situation wasn't worse.&quot;John said: &quot;It would be lovely if she lived here, it would be much more helpful.&quot;When Brenda has to stay at her dad's overnight she is forced to sleep on a small blue two-seater couch in the living room, which aggravates her back problems further.Despite letters of concern being sent from both doctors and Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association to GHA, and contact with her local MP, she is no further forward in finding a property.Brenda said: &quot;Sometimes my back seizes up and I just can't move. It doesn't help having to sleep on this couch when I need to stay.&quot;It's just a nightmare&quot;If I wasn't here my dad would need constant care.&quot;The Occupational Therapist said if it wasn't for me they'd have to come out four times a day, but all I ask them to do is help shower him as I can't lift him.&quot;&quot;I do feel ignored.&quot;Even though I've contacted counsellors and everything, I do feel as though I've been swept to the side and I really don't know what else to do.&quot;Dad John said it would beGHA South Area Director Jennifer Russell said: &quot;We have every sympathy with Esther's situation and are doing everything we can to help her get a home closer to her father. Unfortunately the area she is looking to move into has very few two-bedroom homes and, when they do become available, demand is extremely high. There are other options available such as applying to other social landlords, mutual exchange and a private rent and we will continue to help Esther look into all these options.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

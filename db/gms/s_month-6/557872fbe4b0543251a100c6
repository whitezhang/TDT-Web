British telecoms giant Vodafone is to create 150 new jobs in Scotland as part of an expansion into the home phone and broadband market.
The new posts will be based at its call centre in Glasgow, which currently employs 50 people. 
About 250 other posts will be based in the south east of England.
The jobs were announced at the launch of Vodafone Connect, which from later this summer will offer combined mobile, home phone and broadband packages.
Vodafone UK chief executive Jeroen Hoencamp said: &quot;This is a really exciting move for Vodafone in the UK as we move our business into a new phase. 
&quot;We're looking forward to bringing our customers the benefits of our experience in providing fixed and mobile services, both here in the UK and elsewhere around the world. 
&quot;Our significant investment is creating hundreds of new jobs over the next couple of years.&quot;

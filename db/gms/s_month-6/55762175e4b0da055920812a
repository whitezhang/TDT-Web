RIDING on the wave of wearable gadgetry, tech-lovers in Scotland are set to enjoy the country’s very own smart device; the Aye-Watch.
Unveiled today, the pioneering digital gizmo offers sophisticated functionality, an emotionally sensitive interface and showcases just how versatile an ‘Aye’ can be. A demo can be seen above.
But when it comes to an in-store date, lovers of the Aye-Watch will be waiting a while – the invention has actually been completely fabricated for a comedy sketch as part of a new online series called Wellpark .
 

Borne from a unique collaboration between Tennent’s Lager and a group of writers, directors and animators, the fictional world of Wellpark includes everything from talking dogs, to pals questioning ‘how many is umpteen?’. And now the animated town even has its own tech giant in the form of ‘Peach’, the creators of the Aye-Watch.
Available to watch on YouTube and social media, new Wellpark episodes are written and released every week, with many reacting to events in the real world. More than thirty are being created over the summer. The episodes, which began to appear online from mid-May, have already attracted more than 1.3m views to date.
 

“Smart watches are all well and good but imagine if a Scottish version existed? It would be just as clever – but we bet it would have a cracking sense-of-humour too,” said Jordan McKenna of Tennent’s Lager. “Although the Aye-Watch might not be quite real (yet), its tongue-in-cheek take on things will hopefully make it a favourite, with growing fanbase of Wellpark.
“This won’t be the last that Wellpark viewers hear from Peach. Expect another high-tech invention or two in the pipeline.”

 A TAME bird has been rescued by animal welfare chiefs - after flying into a pet shop. 
 The owner of the stray zebra finch is now being sought by Scottish SPCA . 
It was found after taking refuge in the Pets at Home store in Dumfries.
Inspector Janet Proudlock said, “The zebra finch has an identity ring on her leg and we know she was born in 2013.
“Anyone coming forward should be able to tell us her ring number as this will help ensure we have the right owner.
“She was looking a bit sorry for herself yesterday but is now much chirpier after some food and water.
“If no one comes forward for this lovely wee bird we’ll find her a suitable new home.”
Anyone who recognises the zebra finch is being asked to contact the Scottish SPCA on 03000 999 999.

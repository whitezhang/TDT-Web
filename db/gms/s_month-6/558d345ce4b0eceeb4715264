THE Prince of Wales will visit the home of some of Scotland’s most distinctive malts today.
The Isle of Islay boasts eight whisky distilleries and two of them - Ardbeg and Laphroaig - are marking their 200th anniversary this year.
Charles is expected to enjoy a dram at both distilleries and will also be given the opportunity to fill a cask.
The island trip marks the end of a week of Scottish engagements for the Prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall.
Established by members of Clan Donald, Laphroaig distillery is now owned by Beam Suntory and the whisky is the only one to carry the Royal Warrant of the Prince of Wales.
Ardbeg has been producing whisky since 1798 and was licensed in 1815. It is owned by Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy (LVMH) and managed by Islay-born Michael Heads.
The west coast island is renowned for producing a smoky, peaty style of whisky.
Islay’s six other distilleries are Bowmore, Bruichladdich, Bunnahabhain, Caol Ila, Kilchoman and Lagavulin.

COPS investigating the UK's biggest botulism outbreak detained four men during a raid at a Glasgow house.The Evening Times joined more than 30 officers swooped and battered down the door of suspected heroin dealers.We can exclusively reveal details of the Operation Bilafond, which culminated in the dramatic raid in the Calton area yesterday.More than 40 cases of botulism have been diagnosed across Glasgow and the West of Scotland in the past six months.And the toxin, which has been linked with the death of at least 10 addicts since the outbreak, is commonly found in soil.Four men - aged between 40 and 49 - were detained in connection with alleged drugs offences.As part of the operation, police seized a black Volkswagen Golf and searched a semi-detached property in Millroad Drive.Detective Inspector Jim Biggam, who lead yesterday's operation, told the Evening Times: &quot;This operation is about disrupting the activities of criminals within our communities.&quot;It's all about public reassurance and taking drugs off the streets.&quot;We want members of the local community to know Police Scotland are dedicated to tackling the issues that matter to them.&quot;More than 30 officers gathered at Baird Street Police Office, for yesterday's 10am briefing.The Evening Times joined officers, supported by Police Scotland's dog branch and support unit, as they carried out a raid in Calton.Around a dozen officers - most were dressed in plain clothes - surrounded the two-storey property, while police vehicles manoeuvred into positions around the street.Helmeted officers dressed in padded riot gear used a battering ram to smash their way into the property.Two men were immediately apprehended inside the property.As police entered, the occupants could be heard shouting and two Staffordshire Bull Terriers and an Akita dog barked loudly.Meanwhile, two other men - both aged 40 - were detained outside the house, near a black car, which was parked in the street.After an initial search, the vehicle was seized by officers and taken away to undergo forensic tests.DI Biggam confirmed the outbreak was the biggest ever in Britain.But, months of work from police and their partner agencies, has seen the number of patients diagnosed with the illness continue to fall.He said: &quot;As well as sending out a message to potential offenders, the operation is also about reassuring the public they don't have to put up with this kind of behaviour.&quot;Any information that is passed to us from members of the public, will be acted on.&quot;Botulism can cause paralysis of the arms, legs and the muscles that control breathing.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have repeatedly issued warnings to addict about the outbreak.Patients were identified from across the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, as well as Lanarkshire.The Evening Times can today revealed there have been 44 cases of botulism in Glasgow hospitals since December.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lanarkshire, Police Scotland and Health Protection Scotland launched an investigation after the outbreak was identified.Addicts who inject into muscle or miss a vein are most at risk of contracting botulism from the contaminated heroin, according to health officials.One source said: &quot;Either they've missed the vein and injected it into the skin, or they're muscle popping it because they can't get a vein.&quot;Botulism mutates when it's starved of oxygen.&quot;If you put it directly into the veins where there's oxygen in the blood, it won't be able to mutate.&quot;Most people don't know they've got it until it's too late.&quot;

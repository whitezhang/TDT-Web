PLANS to build a road through a park area used by local people has sparked hundreds of objections.South Lanarkshire Council wants to build Cathkin relief road in Rutherglen at a cost of &pound;21.6million.It would travel through an area known as Fernhill Park which is popular with children, dog walkers, cyclists, joggers and the elderly.A protest group was set up and so far more than 1372 people have signed a petition against the plan.And over 300 have formally objected to the planning application which has been lodged by the council.A report by roads bosses says Rutherglen has had a long standing problem of congestion in the town centre which has led to air quality problems.There are also issues over the reliability of buses, poor links between buses and trains, access problems for non-car owners, a likely increase in traffic from future developments and the high volume of traffic between Glasgow and East Kilbride.The report says: &quot;The local area is categorised by higher than average levels of unemployment with a lower proportion of working age population.&quot;The project will improve access to areas of new development, assisting with job creating and providing improved access to the wider road and transport network and the opportunities this brings.&quot;Cathkin relief road is one of a range of projects across Glasgow and surrounding area being funded by the &pound;1.1billion City Deal which resulted in a &pound;500million cash injection for infrastructure projects from both the Westminster and Scottish governments.But locals insist the new road is not needed and the loss of a popular park far outweighs any improvement in traffic flow in the area.They also claim noise and pollution in what is presently a quiet and peaceful place will be unacceptable.Alan McLennan is one of the leaders of the group campaigning against the bypass.He said: &quot;This road has been mooted for about 50 years but was never built because of lack of demand and lack of funding.&quot;In 2000, an area of ground was turned into what is now known as Fernhill Park by South Lanarkshire Council who put in paths, landscaped it and tidied it up.&quot;They said this would be a park the community would be proud of and people use it all the time. Everyone is up in arms because they don't want to lose it.&quot;Since the opening of the M74 extension, traffic in the area has dropped off considerably so there is no justification for the relief road as far as locals are concerned.&quot;A protest march has been organised for Saturday June 20 at 11am to highlight opposition to the scheme.Mr McLennan said: &quot;It will be more like a peaceful walk to get people out to show there is a big groundswell of opinion against this.&quot;To sign the online petition go to https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/21m-cathrin-relief-roadThe council's head of roads and transportation, Gordon Mackay, said: &quot;Subject to planning permission being granted, construction of the Cathkin Bypass is expected in 2016.&quot;If approved the road will reduce traffic on local residential roads, reduce congestion at peak times and cut carbon emissions.&quot;There would also be significant economic benefits of this and other City Deal projects with opportunities for further economic growth and new jobs. Public transport and cycle journeys would also be improved.&quot;The land has been protected from development for many years due the long standing intention to construct this road when funding became available.&quot;The proposed road is part of the &pound;1.13 billion Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal, an agreement between the UK government, the Scottish Government and eight local authorities.&quot;

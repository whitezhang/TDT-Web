A YOUNG Glaswegian girl has donated seven inches of hair to help make wigs for boys and girls in need.Rebecca McVey, showing an impressive amount of compassion at just seven years of age, also donated money she decided to fundraise as part of the charitable act.&quot;We were watching the television a couple of weeks ago, and on the news she saw an older lady who had donated her hair,&quot; said Rebecca's proud mum, Natalie Shaw.&quot;Her hair was really thick and long. Rebecca decided that she didn't need all of it, and wanted to do a fundraiser as well as the haircut.&quot;She's a very confident girl, this is in her nature.&quot;The inspiration for the generosity may have been found from Rebecca's grandmother, Jessie, who used a wig in the time before she sadly lost her battle with cancer.The charity work is being done in aid of the Little Princess Trust, which provides free real-hair wigs to children who have lost their hair because of cancer treatment or other illnesses.Little Princesses sent Rebecca an information pack to make sure she wanted to go ahead with the haircut, and has been keeping in touch with her since.Rebecca set a target of &pound;150 for the fundraising, but by Friday last week the combined total of her sponsorship sheets and online donation page had already broken the &pound;500 mark.She said: &quot;There's people who need the hair more than me. Mine will grow back, and I don't want to stop now. I want to keep donating hair.&quot;Every morning I was waking up and asking if anyone else had donated, it was exciting.&quot;The Little Princess Trust has no official links with particular hairdressers, but when Lauren Eusebi, owner of Eusebi's Ladies Hair &amp; Beauty Studio, found out about the charity event, she offered to cut Rebecca's hair at no cost.Classmates and teachers at St Timothy's Primary School have also been supportive, with the confident young pupil given a chance to announce her plans during an assembly.Monica Glass, charity manager for the Little Princess Trust, said: &quot;How amazing that little Rebecca wants to do so much to help others.&quot;Not only is she donating her beautiful hair to help make a wig for a poorly child, but she has raised more than enough for a further real hair wig to be purchased for another boy or girl currently suffering with cancer.&quot;What an inspiration Rebecca is!&quot;The average cost to the charity of purchasing a wig is &pound;350. Those made of hair donated by supporters cost it nothing.Rebecca's online fundraising page is remaining open for a short time, and can be found online at https://www.justgiving.com/Natalie-Shaw13/

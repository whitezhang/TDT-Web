Rangers chairman David King insists the Ibrox club will spend "whatever it takes" to guarantee their return to the Scottish Premiership next season.The Ibrox outfit face another 12 months in the Championship after their humiliating 6-1 play-off defeat to Motherwell.But Light Blues chief King has promised to &quot;over-invest&quot; this summer in a bid to ensure his team reclaim their top-flight status.The South Africa-based business man - back in Glasgow to launch the club's season-ticket drive - had previously stated it could take &pound;30million to put the club back on an even keel with Old Firm rivals Celtic.Now he has said: &quot;I think we will need money now because we will need to beef up the squad.&quot;The immediate mandate for the manager who comes in is that he will need to get additional players in.&quot;So there will be a fairly substantial investment required in the next couple of months from me and the other investors.&quot;But if you want to look at the funding plan, it is to spend whatever it takes to win the Championship next year and have at least the nucleus of a squad to move up to the Premier League the year after.&quot;

POLLOK lifted the Evening Times Champions' Cup with a 3-1 victory over Blantyre Victoria at Newlandsfield Park today.And it was a family affair as brothers Robbie and David Winters were the goal heroes for Tony McInally's Stagecoach Super First Division champions.However, it could all have been so different if Vics' Mark Thomson had converted a second-half penalty with the score at 1-1.It was Robbie Winters who opened the scoring for the Lok before Frazer Malcolme levelled.Thomson then watched in agony as Jordan Longmuir dived to his right to push away the spot-kick.And Vics paid the penalty when David Winters DID score from the spot before clinching the victory with a side-footed effort.Pollok's Kevin Bradley was named man of the match in a game watched by a crowd of 1,035.Vics - who won the Central District Fiirst Division - will attempt to make it a double when they meet Thorniewood United in the final of the Euroscot Eng League Cup on Thursday night at Newlandsfield.

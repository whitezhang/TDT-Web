GLASGOW'S Arches nightclub has gone into administration.
 Bosses at the popular Glasgow night spot announced the decision following a meeting of The Arches Board of Directors today after taking legal advice. 
They confirmed they will now begin the process of appointing administrators for both Arches Theatre and Arches Retail Company Limited.
The closure comes after the city’s licensing board announced in April that it had decided to curtail the venue’s licensed hours - forcing them to close at midnight - after a serious of police complaints about drug abuse and disorder.
Regane MacColl, 17, died in February last year after reportedly taking drugs at an Arches club night.
 

Following the decision, more than 37,000 people signed a petition against the midnight order and 400 leading creative figures signed an open letter backing The Arches.
Gordon Kennedy, Chairman of The Arches Board of Directors, said: “The Board has taken professional advice and is left with no other choice than to begin the process of appointing administrators for both The Arches Theatre Ltd and Arches Retail Ltd.
“This decision has been taken with deep regret as it will have a major impact on our staff, business partners, customers, and on Glasgow’s reputation for night time economy.
“The Board sincerely thanks our staff, customers, supporters, performers and partners for their support over the years. This is a very sad day for The Arches and for the city of Glasgow.”

Regeneration helps unemployment fall in one of Glasgow's poorest areasREGENERATION of one of Glasgow's poorest areas has helped resident's unemployment figures drop by a third.Two decades of regeneration in The Gorbals has saw unemployment rates plummet by 31% between 2004 and 2012, according to a new study conducted by the Royal Town Planning Institute (RTPI).The study, Gorbals Regeneration - Delivering Economic Value through Planning, also shows that the number of &quot;income deprived&quot; people, including those on welfare benefits, dropped by the same amount, while the Glasgow as a whole only saw an average of a 16% drop in unemployment figures and 21% fall in those classed as &quot;income deprived&quot; during the same period.Glasgow City Council embarked on the project to revamp the area in the 1990s, which involved a re-design of the once grey buildings, improvements to public space and pedestrian zones as well as the introduction of housing schemes with significant social housing stock.One particular project, the Crown Street Regeneration Project, which swapped south bank of the Clyde area's postwar testament buildings with more modern apartment buildings and living spaces, managed to bag an RTPI award for its impressive results.Bailie Liz Cameron, executive member for jobs and the economy at Glasgow City Council, said: “The Gorbals area is an excellent example of the role town planning can play in making good places.&quot;The planning of the area has sought to repair the urban character of the Gorbals, without copying what was there before and has aspired to define new architectural possibilities within the traditional framework, and the Crown Street project was crucial in redefining perceptions of the quality of urban living that could be achieved in inner city Glasgow.&quot;The good practice established through this project continues to influence the approach to the regeneration of the area and the multi-award winning Laurieston Transformational Regeneration area – immediately to the west of the Gorbals - has built on this approach to urbanism, which has sought to create a place and add value, rather than to just build housesJanet Askew, President of the RTPI added: “We know that living in safer, cleaner and more attractive places is likely to enable individuals to become more economically active and live more fulfilling lives, and this study provides some strong evidence.&quot;In times of austerity, it is all the more important that government, developers and decision-makers keep their focus on and belief in the importance of investing in communities and regeneration.”

HOLIDAY season is upon us.I can tell because our office is beginning to quieten down with people sneaking off for a week or two of annual leave.The beer gardens are starting to get busier through the day - not that I'm there, I'm just gazing longingly in.Lawmakers in a famous Mallorcan resort clearly read the signs too and they've been preparing for the arrival of holidaymakers.On Tuesday strict rules came into force in Magaluf which aim to change the holiday favourite's reputation for rowdy nightlife.The rules include a ban on drinking alcohol on the street at night, getting naked in public and there are also changes to controversial pub crawls.If you flout them you could be forced to hand over the rest of your holiday money.Tourists are being advised about the changes rather than punished for a few weeks until everyone gets used to the idea.Will they ever get used to it though? After the well-publicised measures came into effect, tourists were still spilling out of bars holding their drinks and boasting about their exploits.That's what young people tend to do on holiday and it's going to take more than a few rules to change that.It's part of growing up, for Brits anyway. Just think of the Inbetweeners Movie which poked fun at the whole thing.Those four daft boys were fictional characters but it was so funny because it showed what teenagers get up to when they escape to the sun.Jay falling asleep outside the hotel and being eaten alive by ants, Neil's dance routines, fighting between friends: I've no doubt this has all taken place on real-life holidays in Magaluf.I didn't jet off to the sun when I finished school but a trip to T in the Park was the same thing - it's basically a mission to drink as much as possible.It's just what you do as a teenager.I can understand where authorities are coming from especially when it comes to safety.The resort is trying to stamp out 'balconing', the craze of jumping from hotel balconies.The problem is that it's not Magaluf's problem, it's ours. You only have to go out on a Saturday night to see young people (and older folk- let's not discriminate) behaving badly.Our obsession with binge drinking is ingrained in our culture.You have to admire Magaluf for trying but when are we going to do anything about it?

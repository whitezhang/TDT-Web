A BUTCHER'S shop is to sell official Buckfast-flavoured pies after striking a deal with monks who brew the tonic wine.
Brothers Jason and Garry Rendall started using the booze in their recipes last year.
 Now the pair – who run Rendalls Quality Butchers in Alva, Clackmannanshire – have gone into partnership with Buckfast distributors J Chandler. 
They have been granted a licence to use the Buckfast logo after revealing the range accounts for 15 per cent of their sales.
Jason, 33, says they got the idea to use Buckfast in their products after noticing its popularity.
He said: “We thought steak and ale was a popular pie so if we took out the ale and put in Buckfast.
“It made a really nice, sweet-tasting gravy and since then it has just got more and more popular. We asked Buckfast if it might be possible to get their backing.
 

“I didn’t think we had a chance but they came out and took some of the pies away.
“We’ve been working behind the scenes with them ever since to get products right.
“This means we can use the logo and they test every new product to make sure it’s up to their standards before we can release it.”
Stewart Wilson, from Buckfast’s distribution company J Chandler, said: “The licensing agreement is the first in our history and allows Rendalls to use our trademark officially on their products. They’ve produced some really exceptional things and there’s a lot more in the pipeline now the agreement’s in place.”
 Buckfast has been brewed at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years. 
The monastery opened a new production plant in 2011.

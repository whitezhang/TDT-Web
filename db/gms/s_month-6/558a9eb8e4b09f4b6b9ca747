Schools and businesses take top awardsGREEN GLASGOW BUSINESS AWARDWINNER: SOUTH WEST COMMUNITY CYCLESSouth West Community Cycles helps local people beat poverty, get healthy and improve the environment – not bad for an outfit which began as a small group of residents in Priesthill concerned about a lack of activities in the area.Cycling co-ordinator Andy McLean said: &quot;It's really lovely to be part of Streets Ahead, as you get to see the amazing work being done around the city. We were delighted just to be nominated.&quot;Now based at the newly-developed Pollokshaws West Railway Station, the dedicated team provides cycle hire and bike maintenance classes, repairs, youth groups and a coffee shop. Their growing programme also includes a music group (kazoos mandatory), classes for women and children and a Fix-Your-Own-Bike workshop.“It’s been great to see the way the group has grown,” adds Andy. “Our next project is the 1848 initiative, which aims to build up young people’s confidence and social skills, boosting their self-esteem and employability.”The group has a substantial track record providing opportunities for cycling, education and exercise for all ages, and it prides itself on bringing neighbours and families together through events such as cycle education days in Pollok Park, low-cost cycle hire and group tours of Pollok Park.RUNNER-UP: CASSILTOUN HOUSING ASSOCIATIONCassiltoun Housing Association have worked hard to turn a no-go area into a well-used local park.As well as regenerating Castlemilk Park, the groups runs an employability project involving improvements to local paths, clean-ups and woodland management.They have staged an impressive 600 events for the community – attracting more than 12,000 people.Spokesperson Richard Bolton said: “The woods are now safer, cleaner and more welcoming and our volunteers have worked hard to make them a resource for the whole community to enjoy.“Many of the activities are improving people’s health and wellbeing too –Branching Out, for example, brings people together and our regular health walks get people more active.”He added: “Sessions such as citizen science events give people the opportunity to learn about the park’s flora and fauna and how to manage the woodlands – ensuring they are maintained for future generations.”BEST SCHOOLWINNER: MOUNT FLORIDA PRIMARY AND PARENT PARTNERSHIPParents, pupils and staff at Mount Florida Primary helped to transform their school playground and surrounding area in the run up to last summer’s Commonwealth Games.Their legacy project, which involved creating a huge banner made of clay birds, and adorning local railings and trees with knitted ornaments, was a huge success.Headteacher Carole Neil said: &quot;It was a fantastic team effort and everyone had a great time being involved. The atmosphere surrounding the games was exciting and we wanted to make the most of that.”Parents, like artist Elspeth Fagan, and support assistants including Faith Harper, were central to the success of the project.“Lots of parents have different things to offer, even if they don’t think they do,” she smiles. “We all used our skills to help the school and the end result is amazing.”Pupils Lois Gall, 6, Ivor Dingwall, 7, Harry Grant, 6 and Thomas Fagan, 9, were over the moon when they won the schools award.“We are really proud of our school and our city,” says Lois.RUNNERS-UP: ST NINIAN’S PRIMARY/MALAWI LEADERS OF LEARNINGYou would have to look hard to find a more dedicated bunch of young community volunteers than the pupils at St Ninian's Primary.The school's inspirational team of 'Ninnovators' have worked hard with parents and the community to transform local streets, parks and the canal.Head teacher Mary McLachlan explained: “The work done on tree planting, litter picking and improving our school grounds has transformed our environment, and our work on restoring the Blairdardie Pavilion has had an impact on the whole community. We are so proud of what our young Ninnovators have achieved.”Pupils from St Mungo's and Eastbank Academies organised a day of action in the east end to clean up litter around their schools.It’s part of a year-long leadership initiative, the Malawi Young Leaders of Learning, which will culminate in a two-week visit to Malawi in September.“Young people are often blamed for causing littering, so hopefully these pupils have made a small step in highlighting the anti-social issue to their peers, families and the wider community,” explains Glasgow City Council press office spokesperson Fiona Ross.

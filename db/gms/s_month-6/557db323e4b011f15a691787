 LEAH Shevlin has dropped the biggest hint yet her wedding to footballer Allan McGregor has been called off. 
 The mother-of-one , who is on holiday in Dubai , retweeted a follower telling her it was &quot;his loss big time.&quot; 
 The couple were due to get married next weekend at luxury Mount Stuart House in Rothesay, Bute. 
However, it's reported the pair had a huge argument leading to Hull keeper McGregor to text pals telling them: &quot;Cancel the kilts&quot;.
 

 Last night WAG Leah put on a brave face while posting on Twitter. 
She tweeted a hotel room selfie in a tight white lace bustier and matching skirt, captioned “Dubai Nights”.
And thanking Twitter  followers who had sent her supportive messages, she posted: “Beautiful, genuine and decent people always outnumber the bad. Thank you to all those lovely people for your kind messages.”
 The couple got engaged while on holiday in Dubai in 2008, after a seven month relationship. 

But Leah has now deleted the mention of her fiance in her Twitter biography where she had previously bragged about their fairytale lifestyle.
In 2010, the former WAG was arrested and charged with wasting police time over a statement she made about an alleged assault on her lover.
She claimed she found him unconscious outside their Glasgow home but prosecutors didn't proceed with the case.
 And last month, she was cleared of an assault charge after she allegedly hit a traffic warden with her luxury 4x4 Mercedes in February 2013.

In the meantime, we're taking a short break prior to launching our second winter event at the end of 2015.&quot;Creon Brock, music and theatre programmer for Oran Mor said: “This year’s West End Festival has been another great success at Oran Mor. We've had 38 shows across the festival, and a typically eclectic range of genres including theatre, tribute bands, folk, pop, indie, jazz, talks and poetry.&quot;The highlight of the festival at Oran Mor was our fourth annual 'all dayer' which took place last weekend and saw 14 Scottish bands, playing across three stages, all in the one building.&quot;Other festival highlights included the Mackintosh Queens Cross Summer Concert, ‘Feel the Spirit’, with renowned composer and conductor, John Rutter.For families, author Julia Donaldson and illustrator Nick Sharratt brought the Gruffalo to the festival, giving children the unique opportunity to meet the literary character.Organisers say the festival would not be possible without support from key funders including the National Lottery, Glasgow City Council, Glasgow Arts and Scottish Book Trust, in addition to all local businesses and participants who contributed.

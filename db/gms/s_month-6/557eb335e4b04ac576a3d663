A SENIOR officer should have been involved at the start of the investigation into the death in custody of Sheku Bayoh, according to a former police chief who is now a Labour MSP.
Graeme Pearson, the ex-director of Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, has criticised Police Scotland’s handling of the case.
The Kirkcaldy man died in custody last month after an incident involving up to nine officers.
The circumstances surrounding the death of the gas engineer remain unclear.
Pearson said that there should have been a high-ranking official giving clear information to the family and the public.
He told the Herald: “From the outset Police Scotland should have had a senior officer on the scene to give some kind of account of the facts.

“There should have been a prepared report for the public and this was absent.”
Instead the family claim to have been given five different accounts of what happened to the 31-year-old dad-of-two
His death is now being investigated by the new watchdog, the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner. This process has run into problems as the officers involved were not questioned until weeks after the incident.
Hundreds of people turned out for Bayou’s funeral in Kirkcaldy last week. 
His mother, Aminata Bayoh, travelled from Sierra Leone to Fife to say goodbye to her son. She said: “We want the truth, nothing but the truth.”

BRAVE Jak Trueman’s voice rang out in a theatre last week – four months after his death.
 The inspiring teen won the Sunday Mail Young Scot award for the way he tackled terminal blood cancer. 
 He raised thousands for cancer charities and his school prom was brought forward so he could go with his girlfriend before he died. 
Last week, Jak gave the welcome speech when music, dance and drama group Star Harmonies hit the stage.
His mum Aileen Barr set up the group and Jak, 15, was stage manager and would always make the first announcement.
 

 Aileen, 44, of Mid Calder, West Lothian, said: “Jak recorded it the day after we came home from Yorkhill Hospital, just nine days before he died. 
“I felt immense pride in the fact he made it when he was so ill and put every ounce of expression and strength into his voice
“It was beautiful to hear his voice ring through the speakers as a starting point for the show – but a bitter-sweet moment as I felt devastated he wasn’t there.”
The show, staged at Deans Community High School in Livingston, was directed and produced by Jak’s sister Aimie, 17.

THE Scottish Government will do all it can to help troubled Glasgow arts venue The Arches, the Deputy First Minister has said.
The venue announced yesterday that it would appoint administrators following the forced closure of its nightclub.
Management said they were ‘left with no other choice’ after licensing bosses in Glasgow last month said it would have to close at midnight every day over a series of police complaints about drug misuse and disorder.
The nightclub generated more than half of The Arches’ annual turnover but early closing times have made the business model ‘untenable’.
Sandra White, MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, raised the plight of the venue at First Minister’s Questions at Holyrood, where John Swinney was standing in for Nicola Sturgeon during the First Minster’s trip to the US.
She said: “The Deputy First Minister will be aware that the Arches venue in Glasgow city centre in my constituency has gone into administration with potential loss of 130 jobs.
“Aside from the fact that the Arches is one of Glasgow’s most cultural venues, this is obviously a very worrying time for the staff facing redundancy.
“Can the Deputy First Minister assure those affected that the Scottish Government will offer all the support that it can?”
Mr Swinney said: “Creative Scotland is working hard with the organisation and with other partners to explore options regarding the future of arts programming of this nature in Glasgow.
“Creative Scotland agreed with Glasgow Life and Glasgow City Council to bring forward some of this year’s support for the Arches - &pound;92,000 from Creative Scotland and &pound;37,000 from Glasgow City Council to assist with the delivery of the current arts programme in the short-term.
“I reassure Sandra White that we will look in all ways that we possibly can do to assist in safeguarding the future of what I recognise as a significant cultural venue in the city of Glasgow and a venue that contributes a great deal to the cultural life of Scotland.”

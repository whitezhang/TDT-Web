Video: protesters outside Glasgow City Chambers call for The Arches licence to be reinstatedPROTESTERS staged a lively protest outside the City Chambers today and called for the Arches venue to be placed into public ownership.Artists and theatre bosses joined Arches staff and public supporters at John Street at 9am urging council bosses to re-instate the venue’s licence.A petition was handed to officials as a meeting of the council’s Licensing Committee got underway at 9.30am.Around 150 protestors chanted “Save Our Arches” and waved banners that read: “Don’t let cops close our club” and “Save Jobs, Save Arts, Save Clubs, Save Culture.”Mark Brown, a theatre critic, called for the venue to be placed into public ownership.He said: “The council say ‘people make Glasgow’. It’s all very well to use a slogan like that but actions speak louder than deed.”“The Arches belongs to the people of Glasgow.“We can’t allow the cops to be closing down one of the city’s most important cultural institutions.“Whatever the business model of the Arches is, the licence must be reinstated.“We don’t want the Arches to become a G1 venue. We don’t want to it to become a Wetherspoons.“This is a quarter of a century of culture. That should be celebrated by Glasgow City Council.“The idea that closing a club is going to stop anyone taking drugs is ridiculous.”Kieran Hurley,writer and theatre maker, shouted a series of questions at campaigners including: “Do we want to live in a city that protects its cultural institutions.” They were all answered with a loud “Yes.”The venue went into administration following a decision by the council to force the nightclub part of the operation to close at midnight.The ruling followed a series of police complaints about drug misuse and disorder.A spokesman for Glasgow Licensing Board said: “We fully respect people’s right to protest.“All decisions by the board are based on the individual merits of the case in question and in accordance with the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005.“Changes to this legislation can only be made at the Scottish Parliament.”

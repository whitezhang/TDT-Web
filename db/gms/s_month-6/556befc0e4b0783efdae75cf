The boss of a homelessness charity who raised fears about "excessive" stop and search said police have reassured him that the tactic will not be overused.Director of The Marie Trust, Sandy Farquharson, met a senior officer after service users and volunteers were targeted at the Midland Street premises.He said: &quot;I met with a senior police officer about the issues with stop and search. We raised certain concerns. We do agree that stop and search is sometimes necessary - I have no problem with that - but it was slightly excessive at the time.&quot;The meeting was very good. We understood each other's position and the senior officer agreed it stop and search was perhaps over the top at our building.&quot;I pointed out we are actually trying to help these people and keep them out of the justice system rather than put them in it.&quot;He agreed with that and said he would speak to his officers in the area to avoid it happening too often.&quot;Mr Farquharson said the situation has now &quot;improved dramatically&quot;.He added: &quot;There has rarely been an incident when they have done this and if there has been there was good cause for it. I am very satisfied with the way things have developed.&quot;Grant Campbell, Chief Executive of Glasgow City Mission, said he is &quot;aware of the impact&quot; of stop and search on homeless people but his service users have rarely been targeted.He said: &quot;The only recorded incident we have of bad practice was during the Glasgow Winter Night Shelter of 2013/14. We have an excellent relationship with Police Scotland who immediately dealt with the issue and have not become aware of any further incidents.&quot;Chief Executive of Simon Community Scotland Lorraine McGrath was unavailable for comment.

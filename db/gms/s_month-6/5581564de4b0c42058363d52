A HERO chef last night raced into a burning house to save a neighbour moments before its roof collapsed.
Walter Kay kicked a door down then dragged the man and his pet dog out of the smoke-filled home as flames spread across the ceiling.
Wearing just a T-shirt, Walter, 42, ran back in with a garden hose in a bid to put out the blaze.
Then he saw the ceiling start to cave and got out “two or three seconds” before it crashed down.
Fire engulfed the wooden semi-detached house in Tranent, East Lothian at about 5pm.
But Walter was alerted to the drama by his 13-year-old daughter, who screamed about the smoke.
 

The dad-of-two said: “I saw black, thick smoke coming from the house.
“I jumped over my fence and ran through two gardens to reach it and kicked the back door open. Smoke blinded me so I got down on the ground and could see a set of legs. The man was lost in the smoke.
“I got to him and asked if he was alone. He said it was just him and his dog. Then a piece of burning wood fell between us.
“I pulled him out the front door then went back to get his collie.”
The neighbour – who is in his 60s – was uninjured and thanked Walter for saving him as he watched his home burn.
Dad-of-two Walter, a chef at Craigielaw golf club in Aberlady, said: “He was really shaken up. Thirty seconds after we got out his whole house was ablaze.”
The neighbour was too upset to speak about his ordeal. The house next door was also gutted by the spreading fire but no one was home.
At the blaze’s height, six fire engines and 25 firefighters were at the scene.

Ciaran Williamson, 8, who died after a tombstone fell on top of him when he was playing with friends in a Glasgow cemetery, will be laid to rest on Friday.
The short funeral service will take place at Lammermoor Avenue in Cardonald and will be followed by a private burial in Barrhead.
A statement from Ciaran’s family after his death said: &quot;We would like to take this opportunity to inform you that our son Ciaran James Williamson sadly passed away in a tragic accident at Craigton Crematorium.
&quot;We would respectfully ask that you respect our privacy at this distressing time.&quot;

Maureen Simpson, Lourdes Primary School headteacher, added: &quot;This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and prayers are with Ciaran’s family and friends at this time.
&quot;This is a shock to our school community and we will do all that we can to support pupils and staff through this difficult period.
&quot;Ciaran was a popular pupil and will be missed by us all.&quot;
Two other young boys who had been at the cemetery with Ciaran, both aged ten, were also injured as a result of the incident but have since been released from hospital.

A former bar owner has celebrated her 100th birthday – with her first ever alcoholic drink.
Annie Mackie spent nearly four decades in the pub trade but never touched a drop until she had her first sherry to mark the occasion.
Annie, fromBanchory, Aberdeenshire, celebrated with 110 friends and family but admitted she didn’t much care for the tipple.
She said: “It was splendid and all of my family turned up – all five generations of us were there.
“I was given 132 cards, which was too many to put up in my room. I’ve so many flowers it’s like a forest.
“I tried a bit of sherry but it wasn’t very nice.”
Annie – who has lived through two world wars – spent more than 35 years at the helm of the Garlogie bar, running it with her first husband Robert Allan.
She married him in 1935 and was widowed in 1952.
Annie was born in the village of Drumoak and has never moved more than 10 miles from her first home.
Her stint at the Garlogie saw her host stars including Doris Speed, who played Coronation Street landlady Annie Walker.
She had four children and is great-great-grandmother to eight. Daughter-in-law Margaret Allan said: “She carried on the bar by herself until she married Peter Mackie in the 60s.
“She’s just the most lovely person. She’s never left this part of the country because she loves the peace and quiet so much.
“She puts her health down to genes – she had an auntie who lived to 101 and I think she could break that.”

 T IN THE PARK has been responsible for a massive boost to Scotland’s economy - while the impact of the fest on promoting Scotland around the world is immeasurable. 
New figures from UK Music show that music tourism - as the officials call it - has added a whopping &pound;280 million a year to the country’s revenue.
And as well as creating 2000 jobs and attracting 720,000 visitors to festivals and music concerts, punters on average spend &pound;724 a head during their trip to Scotland.
T in the Park is amongst the events which have managed to attract the big money (&pound;155 million from festivals alone) and they claim the benefits of the Perthshire festival will be seen for years to come.
A T in the Park spokesperson said: “A report carried out by UKOS last year showed that T in the Park generates almost &pound;15.4 million for the national economy and &pound;2.7 million locally. Its wider impact on promoting a positive picture of Scotland nationally and internationally via media coverage and hours of BBC footage is immeasurable. Culturally, it has been responsible for helping to kickstart the careers of countless artists including Biffy Clyro, Paolo Nutini, Snow Patrol and Calvin Harris and socially it has provided an important rite of passage for more than 1 million young Scots since launching in 1994.”
 She added: “T in the Park is Perthshire’s third biggest tourist attraction introducing new visitors to the area every year who would not otherwise have made the trip. Research from EKOS shows that more than half of last year’s festival attendees said that they are likely to visit the area again (outwith the festival) within the next three years.” 
 Festivals like Wickerman, HebCelt, Rewind, The Jazz Festival, Loopallu, and Belladrum have also added to this figure with the 13,000-capacity SSE Hydro arena in Glasgow proving a major attraction too. 
Music tourism contributed &pound;3.1 billion to the UK in 2014.

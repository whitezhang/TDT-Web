Social Bite, the social enterprise sandwich shop chain which provides jobs for homeless people, is expanding with a new shop opening in Aberdeen.
The not-for-profit, which has two outlets in Edinburgh and two in Glasgow, is to open a new shop on Union Street in Aberdeen next month – one of two outlets planned for the Granite City.
 Social Bite co-founder Josh Littlejohn noted in a comment article he penned for Insider back in February he also plans to expand the chain into Dundee later in the summer. 
The new 450 sq.ft outlet in Union Street secured &pound;175,000 in funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery.
The new outlet will initially employ five to six people.
Littlejohn said: “We’re absolutely thrilled to be opening in Aberdeen after many months of planning. The people of Edinburgh and Glasgow have really bought into what we call our ‘social business’ model and we’ve had a lot of requests to expand into Aberdeen.
“Thanks to funding from players of People’s Postcode Lottery, our dream is now a reality and we’re already recruiting for the new shop.”
Social Bite’s menus are created by Michelin star chef Mike Mathieson and the business’ aim is to compete with the likes of Pret a Manger and Greggs while helping the homeless and supporting good causes.
A quarter of Social Bite’s staff is made up of formerly homeless people and the business operates a ‘suspended’ coffee and food programme whereby customers can pay for a hot drink or food for a homeless person.
Head of Charities at People’s Postcode Lottery, Clara Govier, said: “Josh and his team do an amazing job and I’m delighted that the people of Aberdeen will be able to experience Social Bite, thanks to players of People’s Postcode Lottery.”

THEY say a dog is man’s best friend … and for lovestruck Angus MacLellan, his pet Danny was also his best man.
The Border collie is so special to Angus and his new wife Tasha that he had another big role at their wedding – walking the bride up the aisle.
Dapper Danny was dressed in a bow tie and sporran to match Angus’s kilt, along with a pouch for the rings.
And the wedding, at Avoch Parish Church on the Black Isle, Easter Ross, couldn’t have gone better.
 Tasha, from Paisley , said: “We know it’s very unusual but Danny is part of us and our story. 
 

&quot;He comes everywhere with us and it was natural he would be here when we got married. He looked so lovely in his outfit, which a lady very kindly made for him.”
 The couple were the first to marry in the church in five years. And session clerk Bob Moore, who was also a witness to the wedding , is hopeful that more people will follow them. 
He said: “It’s a shame there have been so few weddings here, so maybe Angus and Natasha have set a precedent.
“It really was a lovely service.
“Danny sat with me during the service and he was every inch the best man.”

Children's services in North Lanarkshire have been praised as amongst the best in Scotland.
The verdict comes in an official report by the Care Inspectorate which is conducting a series of reviews on services across the country.
Inspectors visited Scotland's fourth largest local authority between October and November last year. 
Their report expressed confidence that North Lanarkshire's services were improving the lives of local children.
They carried out a review of the children's services provided by the council and its partners, including Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue, NHS Lanarkshire and the Children's Reporter. 
The inspectors met almost 100 children, their families and care staff as part of their findings into the standard of care they were receiving, and the difference it was making to their lives. 
Their report looked at young people under the age of 18 - or up until they are 21 years and beyond if they have been looked after.
The joint inspection report awarded six &quot;very goods&quot; and three &quot;goods&quot; from nine key categories identified as being essential to improving the lives of young people.
Inspectors agreed one area for improvement with the partners: to ensure consistency of practice in the multi-agency response to child protection issues. 
This had already been identified as an issue by the council and its partners.
The report also highlighted some examples of good practice in North Lanarkshire, including a partnership with Motherwell Football Club Community Trust.
The Trust uses the influence of the football club and sport to deliver programmes to tackle issues including sexual health, smoking, alcohol and substance abuse. 
Some of the programmes involve footballers and coaches from Motherwell FC's first team as role models with programmes being delivered in the SPFL club's Fir Park Stadium.

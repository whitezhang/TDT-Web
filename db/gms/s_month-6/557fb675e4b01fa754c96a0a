GLASGOW City Council leader, Gordon Matheson, plans to become an MSP if he is successful in his bid to be Labour's deputy leader.New party rules mean councillors can stand as deputy without being MSPs, but Mr Matheson said he would seek election to the Scottish Parliament next year.As reported in later editions of the Evening Times yesterday Mr Matheson declared his intention to stand for deputy.He said he was elected unopposed as council leader until May 2016 and said by then Labour would have delivered on all the 2012 manifesto pledges.He said he has the necessary experience but able to bring freshness to the party nationally.As deputy he would automatically go to the top of the Glasgow list and he has no current plans to seek to contest one of the eight Glasgow constituencies.Internal Labour politics and rivalry for seats however could see him face resistance from within the city and from former councillors.Labour has three Glasgow constituency MSPs and three list MSPs.If Mr Matheson was successful he would knock former councillor Hanzala Malik off top spot on the list.Mr Malik said that could influence who he chooses to support in the contest for deputy.He said: I'm a list MSP and I intend to remain on the list. It will be for the Glasgow members to decide but that's my intention.&quot;When asked if it would influence his vote in the leadership elections he said: &quot;It might. One has to do the arithmetic.&quot;Gordon is the leader of the council and I'm surprised he feels he has to tool to the list. I will have to look at the whole situation. It would influence my decision.&quot;Mr Matheson is confident his record as council leader makes him the best candidate for the leadership and said if successful the rules say he goes straight to number one on the list, almost certainly guaranteeing him a seat at Holyrood.He said: &quot;This isn't the time to be shy about these things.&quot;People looking objectively at Scotland would regard Glasgow as the big success story.&quot;He lists the City Deal, the Commonwealth Games and diversification of the economy as Glasgow success stories during his six years as leader of the council.On the City Deal he added: &quot;I managed the politics of that with the UK and Scottish governments on the eve of the referendum.&quot;He said what he stands on is a &quot;record of achievement&quot;.Mr Matheson faces a challenge from Inverclyde Council leader, Stephen McCabe.Others are expected to announce before nominations close on Friday.Mr Malik said he was aware of others considering a bid.He added: &quot;I was hoping Jackie Baillie would stand, she has a lot of experience, but in her absence I'll wait to see who the candidates are.&quot;It is very early in the day. I know of at least two others considering standing.&quot;

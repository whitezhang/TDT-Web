 POLICE are appealing for information as concerns grow for missing Ayrshire man David O'Donnell who was last seen visiting a work customer on Monday. 
David, 35, who works for a coachworks company in Ayr, left his home in Dunure Place, Kilmarnock at around 9am that morning before going to Riverview in Cumnock.
He was last seen leaving a work customer in Cumnock around 10am and has not been in contact with his family since.
David’s car, a silver Jaguar XJ6 with the registration LV57 XYE, was seen on the Forth Road Bridge coming into Edinburgh before being later spotted on the M8 westbound near to Harthill Service Station.
Inspector Brian Anderson from Kilmarnock Police said: &quot;David’s family is extremely worried about him as it’s so out of character for him not to be in touch with them.
&quot;I am appealing to anyone who may have seen David or his car to contact us so that we know he is safe and well.&quot;
David is described as 5ft 8in in height with a slim build and is clean shaven with blue eyes and short grey hair.
On the day he disappeared David was wearing a grey polo shirt and grey sweatshirt, both with a company logo on them. He was also wearing grey trousers, black shoes and a blue waterproof jacket.
Inspector Anderson added: &quot;If you have any knowledge or information as to David’s whereabouts, please get in touch with police.&quot;
 Anyone with information can contact officers at Kilmarnock Police Office on the non-emergency number, 101.

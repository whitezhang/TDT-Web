STUNNED shoppers watched armed police pick up their lunch at a busy supermarket – months after Scotland’s top cop vowed officers would no longer carry guns on routine patrols.
One of the policemen was filmed with a handgun hanging from his belt as he browsed the food aisles in Tesco in South Queensferry, near Edinburgh, for several minutes.
 In October, Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said armed officers would only be deployed when “firearms offences are taking place or where there is a threat to life”. 
But Forrest Hamilton, 20, of Fife, captured footage of one of the two armed officers when they popped into the supermarket at lunchtime on Monday.
 

The photographer said: “It definitely caused a stir. I could see people looking over.
“There were two officers – they both had handguns. They were walking around for a good five minutes and this officer just strolled up to the salad section. It was clear he had a weapon.
“When I saw them, I followed them around in the shop because I remembered reading what Stephen House had said in the Record.
“This isn’t America – we don’t need police with guns in Tesco.”
House sparked an outcry last year when he decided to allow firearms officers to be deployed on routine patrols without consulting MSPs or the public. The angry reaction later prompted him to make a U-turn on the policy.

Last night, Chief Superintendent Elaine Ferguson insisted: “This officer was doing absolutely nothing wrong.
“Police Scotland’s Standing Firearms Authority means that there is a chance that members of the public will see a small number of our officers in public places wearing sidearms.
“Armed officers must wear their sidearm while on duty at all times, but are only sent to incidents where an armed response is deemed necessary.”

MOTORISTS across Scotland were facing weather conditions more akin to mid winter than the beginning of summer today.
High winds, heavy rain and surface water made for difficult driving conditions in various oparts of the country.
The A90 Forth road bridge was closed to high-sided vehicles, while the A1 - A6093 Haddington to Thistly Cross saw lane closures caused by surface water.
Surface water was also a problem in the south, on the A74 (M) and the M74 on-ramp at Hamilton, junction six.
Traffic Scotland tweeted that spray was also a problem for motorists.
There was also high winds warnings on the A92 Tay Bridge at Dundee.
Traffic Scotland also issued a weather warning.
 

It said: &quot;Strong to gale force winds with gusts to 40 to 50 mph in places will continue again today - indeed gusts could reach around 55 mph in a few exposed sites.
“Given the unseasonable nature of the winds, the public should be aware of the potential for localised disruption to transport and outdoor activities, while damage to some trees remains possible.”
Meanwhile, in Glasgow the squinty bridge saw a stand-off between a bus driver and a taxi driver.
Both carriageways of the bridge are now open fully - but both are for two-way traffic.
The western carriageway is for buses and taxis only, while the eastern one is for general traffic.
Both vehicles remained stopped as the bus tried to turn the corner from the Broomielaw.
A witness said: &quot;None of them wanted to move, they were both claiming to be in the right. It caused a huge tail-back.&quot;

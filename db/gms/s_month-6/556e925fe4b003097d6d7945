We are obviously devastated at the loss.&quot;Charles was a fine man, a talented politician, and a loving father to his young son.&quot;We ask therefore that the privacy of his family is respected in the coming days.&quot;Tributes have been pouring in for the Scottish former MP on Twitter from MPs and political commentators.Liberal Democrat leadership hopeful Tim Farron MP said: &quot;I am utterly heartbroken about the news of Charles' passing. He was a colleague, friend and mentor. We've lost a giant today.&quot;Labour MP Diane Abbott tweeted: &quot;How sad to hear that Charles Kennedy has died. Met him often. Very nice, very clever, very principled man.&quot;Conservative Maria Caulfield MP said: &quot;Just the saddest news about Charles Kennedy. Heartfelt sympathies to his family.&quot;Scottish First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;Sad beyond words to hear the news about Charlie Kennedy. A lovely man and one of the most talented politicians of his time. Gone too soon.&quot;Fellow former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown paid tribute to his successor, tweeting: &quot;Charles Kennedy. In a political age not overburdened with gaiety and good sense, he brought us wit, charm, judgement, principle and decency.&quot;Nick Clegg paid tribute to his predecessor as Liberal Democrat leader: &quot;Charles's untimely death robs Britain of one of the most gifted politicians of his generation.&quot;Charles devoted his life to public service, yet he had an unusual gift for speaking about politics with humour and humility which touched people well beyond the world of politics.&quot;He was a staunch internationalist and passionate believer in Britain's role in Europe, yet he was a proud Highlander, Scot and British parliamentarian.&quot;Nick Clegg paid tribute to his predecessor as Lib Dem leader, tweeting: &quot;Charles Kennedy was one of the most gifted politicians of a generation, he always spoke with great humour, humility and courage.&quot;Principal and vice chancellor of the University of Glasgow Professor Anton Muscatelli said: &quot;Charles was a distinguished alumnus of the University of Glasgow and served two terms as rector.&quot;He contributed an enormous amount, and was a friend to all who came into contact with him.&quot;The thoughts and prayers of all at the University of Glasgow are with Charles's family at this dreadfully sad and tragic time.&quot;File photos of Charles Kennedy are now available on Mediapoint.The former Lib Dem leader addresses the party's annual conference in Brighton on September 19, 2006.Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie told BBC Radio Scotland: &quot;I feel just absolutely devastated that somebody of such great talent, warmth and personality has just been taken from us.&quot;I only met him 12 days ago in Glasgow to discuss the future of his political career because he had so much to give. With that cheeky smile, that Highland voice and just a few well chosen words, he was able just to certainly capture my political heart and many people across the nation.&quot;Asked how Mr Kennedy had responded to losing his seat in the general election, he said: &quot;He was actually remarkably calm. I don't know whether he saw it coming but he was a very laid-back man anyway, very private, very modest and somebody who just went with the flow.&quot;He was just accepting the result and thinking about what next he could contribute.&quot;I'm sure he was desperate to take part in the European referendum. I'm sure he would have been a major voice in that.&quot;I'm just sad that Britain won't hear his wise words on Europe because he was passionate about the relationship with Europe like on so many other things, whether Iraq or social justice or the very important role he played in keeping Scotland in the United Kingdom.&quot;Sir Menzies Campbell, who served as Mr Kennedy's deputy leader and foreign affairs spokesman during the Iraq war and succeeded him as Liberal Democrat leader in 2006, said: &quot;At a time when politicians are accused of being out of touch with the public, that charge could never be levelled against Charles Kennedy.&quot;He had the articulate ability to express important political issues in a style which everyone could recognise and with a simplicity that made them much easier to understand.&quot;He was not a naturally adversarial politician and this undoubtedly accounts for the enormous respect and remarkable affection with which he was regarded by both public and politicians alike.&quot;His opposition to the Iraq war was a brave and courageous stand at a time when opinion in the House of Commons was very substantially in favour of Tony Blair's policy. Some disgracefully accused him in the House of being a quisling but Charles and the Liberal Democrats had the final satisfaction that under his leadership a principled stand was taken against a monstrous foreign policy mistake, and was ultimately proved correct.&quot;In a statement, Mr Farron said: &quot;Charles was a friend, colleague and personal mentor. I am desperately saddened by news of his death this morning. His gentle good humour combined with real courage, enabled him to engage with people who might otherwise have had little interest in politics. And he gave voice to the views of millions as the only mainstream party leader to oppose the Iraq War. His loss will be sorely felt today. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.&quot;Former shadow foreign secretary and ex-Labour MP Douglas Alexander wrote: &quot;Bereft at news of Charles Kennedy. He was a warm, decent &amp; generous Scot. Our politics and our national life is a lot poorer this morning.&quot;And Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond wrote: &quot;Charles Kennedy was known by everybody &amp; liked by everybody across the political spectrum. Very sad to lose such a talented person so young.&quot;Alex Salmond said Mr Kennedy's leadership had been tested when he opposed the Iraq war, and he had passed the test with &quot;flying colours.&quot;&quot;When it came to a decision where the establishment was facing one way and the people were facing another way, he took the side of the people,&quot; Mr Salmond told the BBC.&quot;He had the common touch and people loved him for it, and I think the fact he had frailties... I don't think it damaged his reputation with the public, because lots of people have frailties, lots of people have weaknesses, and the fact that Charles had them to a certain extent made him all the more human.&quot;Commenting on facing Mr Kennedy as an opponent in the Scottish independence referendum, Mr Salmond added: &quot;In terms of the independence campaign, I don't think his heart was in the Better Together campaign.&quot;His heart would have been in a pro-European campaign - that's the campaign that Charles would have engaged in heart and soul.&quot;He was an interesting, complex character, but above all an outstanding communicator and a fine human being.&quot;Scotland Secretary David Mundell said: &quot;I have known Charles for over 30 years. He was an outstanding Scottish and British politician who was deeply committed to the Highlands and held in high esteem across the political spectrum for his judgment and principles.&quot;He was a genuinely nice man and his sense of humour and fun will be hugely missed. My sincere condolences go to his family at this terrible time.&quot;Danny Alexander, former chief secretary to the Treasury, said: &quot;On this desperately sad day, my thoughts are with Charles's family.&quot;Charles was a Highlander through and through, a great liberal, and one of the most talented politicians of his generation. He achieved a great deal for the communities he loved in the north of Scotland, and he gave courageous leadership to the opposition to the Iraq War.&quot;One of the many consequences of this tragic, untimely loss is that our country will not have the benefit of his sane, principled and persuasive voice in the debates about Scotland and Europe - two issues he cared passionately about. We will miss him more than words can say.&quot;Father Roddy McAuley, parish priest at St John's Church in Caol, where both of Mr Kennedy's parents were laid to rest, paid tribute to him.&quot;Charles was a much loved and respected parishioner of St John's Parish,&quot; he said.&quot;He was a very humble and thoughtful person and he will be sorely missed.&quot;Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of his family. May he rest in peace.&quot;Lib Dem former deputy leader Simon Hughes said: &quot;Millions of people today will just feel a sense of shock and sadness at Charles' death. Charles remained a star in the political firmament all the time from his first election in 1983.&quot;From 1983-2015 together in the House of Commons and around the country, I saw a friend and colleague who never wavered in his principles, never wavered in his determination and never wavered in his generous friendships.&quot;Liberal Democrat opposition to the Iraq War was led by Charles and united millions in the country behind him.&quot;Our success in Parliament was led by Charles and paved the way for our participation in government - even though Charles himself had reservations about going into coalition with the Conservatives.&quot;And our credibility in the country was hugely enhanced by Charles, who was one of the best political communicators of our generation.&quot;We must just hope and pray that the affection felt by so many for Charles Kennedy gives strength and support to Sarah and Donald and all Charles' family.&quot;

By VICTORIA WELDONTHE Western Infirmary has become the latest Glasgow hospital to close its Emergency Department, with patients now being seen at the city's new super-hospital.The Western's emergency department closed its doors on Saturday at 8am and the final patients in the wards have now been moved to South Glasgow University Hospital (SGUH).All three of the city's adult emergency departments have now relocated to the new &pound;842 million site, with the final wards from Gartnaval General Hospital due to move there on June 6.The SGUH has attracted some criticism in the wake of its opening - including claims of patients waiting on trolleys for hours and problems with blocked toilets.However, at the hospital's Accident and Emergency department yesterday, patients said they were pleased with the care they had received, with several saying they had been seen within two hours.Jonathan Best, the service director who led the Western Infirmary move, said: &quot;We're very pleased with the seamless transition of patients, staff and services to the South Glasgow University Hospital.&quot;After detailed planning and partnership working with staff and the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS), 121 patients have been moved over the weekend. This brings the total number of patients moved to almost 600.&quot;Our staff and SAS deserve high praise for ensuring a smooth transition while ensuring services were still being delivered throughout.&quot;Patients with serious injuries and major emergencies should now attend at SGUH, while people living in the Summerston or Maryhill areas should attend at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.Those with minor injuries such as cuts, broken bones, sprains and minor burns can still be treated at the Western Infirmary at a newly established West Glasgow Minor Injuries Unit.Patients with minor injuries in Summerston or Maryhill can attend the Minor Injury Units at either Glasgow Royal Infirmary or Stobhill Hospital.

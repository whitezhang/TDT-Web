A man has been jailed for nine years for raping a young girl and abusing another at his farmhouse in Argyll.
Peter Carter, 49, who is originally from Yorkshire, was convicted of raping the nine-year-old and sexually abusing her between 2005 and 2009.
He was also found guilty of abusing a seven-year-old girl at the same property in August 2011.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Carter was told he would be monitored for three years after his release.
He was also placed on the sex offenders' register.
Jailing him, temporary judge John Becket QC told Carter: &quot;In different ways you have traumatised your two child victims. 
&quot;Your conduct was reprehensible in raping a young girl who was nine years old at the time. 
&quot;The court must seek to deter you and others from committing such crimes and to protect children from you.&quot; 
The court heard that Carter gave up his job as an engineer and moved to Scotland where he started a carpentry business. 
Both girls, who were abused at his farmhouse, gave evidence against him via a video link.
The older girl told the court that, when police interviewed her about Carter's abuse, she was unable to say what had happened to her out loud. 
She wrote down details of the sex assaults on a piece of paper. 
Carter claimed that his victims were lying about what happened and still maintains his innocence.

HOLIDAYMAKERS looking for a great escape could soon be heading to a former PoW camp that once held Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess.
Planners want to convert 10 B-listed Nissen huts at Cultybraggan camp near Comrie, Perthshire, to create self-catering and hostel-type accomodation.
The 64-acre site – the last remaining purpose-built PoW camp in the UK – is owned by Comrie Development Trust since exercising a right-to-buy in 2007.
The &pound;600,000 project is hoping to cash in on a trend for holidaying in unusual places – so called “heritage hutting”.
Camp 21, as Cultybraggan was known during World War II, was built in 1939 and contained up to 4000 German prisoners at a time, many of them hardened SS or Afrika Korps troops.
Nazi leader Hess is reputed to have been held there for a night en route to England after &shy;crash-landing in Eaglesham, Renfrewshire, in 1941, as he tried to pass a message to the Duke of Hamilton.
In 1944, five Nazi prisoners murdered a fellow prisoner, sergeant Wolfgang Rostberg and were eventually hanged at Pentonville Prison in London.
The complex became a training camp after the war and was used until the MoD closed it in 2004.
The restoration will be overseen by Historic Scotland, who have awarded &pound;257,500 to the project.
Comrie Development Trust chair Emma Margrett said: “This is a really promising project.”

A TARTAN Army pensioner was left penniless after having &pound;400 nicked from his sporran in Dublin.
Andy Redmond was in a pub in the city’s famous Temple Bar when an opportunist thief took his wallet.
It contained bank cards and &pound;400 in holiday cash for a two-week trip to Spain with five mates.
Yesterday, Motherwell pensioner Andy vowed to carry on with his holiday after his friends clubbed together to bail him out.
But Andy admitted the theft had soured his visit to Dublin for Scotland’s 1-1 draw with the Republic of Ireland on Saturday.
As he prepared to fly from Dublin to Santander for his holiday in the sun, the 67-year-old said: “It has taken the shine off things, I suppose.
“I was more worried about the bank cards but I got them back after someone handed my wallet into the pub later. Don’t get me wrong, I still had a good time but it proved an expensive trip.”
Meanwhile, the Garda in Dublin are investigating two thefts from Scotland fans in the Aston Quay area.
It is understood they took place at Fitzgerald’s pub on Friday night as fans hit the town on the eve of the crunch qualifying game.
But there were no other major issues involving Scotland fans, who took over large areas of the Aviva Stadium on Saturday night.
It’s estimated that between 15,000 and 20,000 Tartan Army footsoldiers went to Dublin to see the national team make progress on the way to qualifying for next summer’s European Championship in France.

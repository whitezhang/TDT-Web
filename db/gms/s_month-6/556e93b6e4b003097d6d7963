BARRHEAD Travel has won many awards in its time.They have come from a diverse range of organisations - travel associations, Scottish Enterprise, and the Association of Cruise Experts, to name just three.But one award, presented to travel specialists five years ago, means a lot to the company - because it came from readers of this very paper.It was in October 2010 that Bill Munro and his daughter Sharon, the duo behind Barrhead Travel, accepted the award at the Glasgow Business Awards, at the Thistle Hotel.&quot;Absolutely delighted,&quot; they said in unison when asked for their reaction. Added Bill: &quot;It's especially great for the staff, who work so, so hard. It's just a terrific honour.&quot;Nearly five years on, Sharon, now chief executive at the company, says: &quot;We were delighted to be named Glasgow's Favourite Business in 2010, because it was voted for by the public, and so winning the title was a fantastic vote of confidence in Barrhead Travel.&quot;We certainly saw new customers come through our doors as a result of the award, and it's still something we're very proud of - although we have branches all across the country these days, our roots are very much still in Glasgow. Being named the city's favourite business was extra-special.&quot;Another organisation that looks back fondly at its award is Glasgow Credit Union.&quot;We were so pleased to be awarded the title of Glasgow's Favourite Business by Evening Times readers in 2013 - and with a record number of people voting for us,&quot; says June Walker, Chief Executive.&quot;As a more than profit business we exist very simply to provide loans, mortgages and savings to people living and working within the G postcode and to do so with exceptional levels of service. We share our profits with members in the form of dividend each December, reinvest in the business to make products and services better and are committed to improving the city we live by providing donations and support to grassroots organisations that help create positive social impact within the local area.&quot;To be recognised for the work we do helping individuals and across the city was hugely rewarding for our staff and members. We wore our 'Glasgow's Favourite Business' title with huge pride.&quot;The award has helped us spread our message of ethical financial services to more people and reinforced our position as the alternative loans, mortgages and savings company of choice for local people.&quot;The accolade of Glasgow's Favourite Business, exclusively voted for by Evening Times readers, is one of the main categories of the 2015 business awards.Businesses across the city are now being encouraged to submit entries to the highly anticipated awards.The closing date for entries is Friday, June 26.The 18th annual ceremony, sponsored by Bank of Scotland, is one of the big events in the city's business calendar.The awards, which will be held at the Hilton Glasgow on Thursday, October 1, are designed to celebrate the hard work and achievements of Glasgow's businesses.No fewer than 16 categories will be decided on the night, covering everything from creative marketing, most outstanding business and sustainable development to innovation in business and excellence in communications.There are also three awards aimed at the best performing businesses, with up to 10 employees, between 11 and 50 employees, and more than 51.Each winner will receive a hand-crafted trophy.Bank of Scotland's Area Director for Glasgow and West of Scotland, Pete Flockhart, said yesterday: &quot;The Glasgow Business Awards are a fantastic opportunity for businesses of all sizes and sectors from across the city to have their hard work and contributions to both the local and wider Scottish economy recognised by their peers.&quot;But with just over a month to go until the deadline for entries, time is running out for firms to be in with a chance to take home an award on the evening.&quot;Added Paul: &quot;As a long-standing supporter of the Glasgow Business Awards, Bank of Scotland has witnessed the sheer variety of businesses that have been recognised over the years, showcasing some of the most outstanding business acumen and entrepreneurial spirit that this city has to offer. Whether it be an exciting start-up, house-hold name or family run firm, the evening is a true celebration of Glasgow's vibrant business landscape that is not to be missed.&quot;Stuart Patrick, chief executive of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, said the city had a thriving business community, and the Glasgow Business Awards were an &quot;excellent&quot; way of showcasing this.&quot;The Glasgow's Favourite Businesses category is an extremely sought-after accolade, and the competition is always an exciting one,&quot; said Stuart.&quot;We encourage all types of businesses from across the city and its various sectors to enter these prestigious awards, as it's a fantastic way to exhibit all the great work that is being done.&quot;The ceremony is always an enjoyable occasion which is held in high regard by businesses across Glasgow.&quot;You can read full details of the awards categories and descriptions, and download category-specific application forms, from the Glasgow Chamber of Commerce website: www.glasgowchamberofcommerce.comIf you have any queries, or need further information, contact the Glasgow Business Awards 2015 information helpline on 0141-275 4842 or email trobertson@stratagem.co.uk

 Partick Thistle have signed goalkeeper Tomas Cerny on a one-year deal. 
 The 30-year-old joined Hibernian in January but did not feature in the first team at Easter Road. 
 Cerny, capped at U21 level for the Czech Republic, spent five years with Hamilton Academical, leaving for CSKA Sofia in 2012. 
 He replaces Scott Fox in the Firhill squad, with the 27-year-old having refused a new contract and moving on to Ross County.

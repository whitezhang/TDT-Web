A woman and her gay pal were jailed for robbing a dad of his daughter.
Evil Vikki Gilmore and Chris Yates were caged for a &quot;wicked, cynical and persistent&quot; plot to deprive Steven North of his four-year-old daughter.
Gilmore, 29, convinced Steven she'd aborted their baby after they split up - then registered 35-year-old Yates as the father.
Perth Sheriff Court heard how the vile pair even invented an online surrogate mother and conned social workers, midwives and a registrar into believing they were her parents.
Police believe Gilmore, 29, sold the little girl to Yates for as little as &pound;100 as part of the plot described in court as &quot;cynical, calculated and inhumane.&quot;
As Sheriff William Wood sentenced the pair to 3-years in prison, cheers and applause broke out in the courtroom.
He said: &quot;You persisted in this wicked scheme for three years and had it not been for Steven North's determination the child could have suffered continued damage.
 

&quot;Neither of you have accepted responsibility for your actions and have no understanding of the impact of your behaviour.&quot;
Mr North declined to comment on the sentence but a close friend said: &quot;He is absolutely delighted. This was a horrible crime and they got the punishment they deserved.&quot;

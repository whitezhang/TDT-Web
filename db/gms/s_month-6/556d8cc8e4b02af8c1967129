AN Irishman linked to an IRA bid to bomb English seaside towns in the 80s met a man accused of plotting to murder Johnny “Mad Dog” Adair, a court was told yesterday.
The trial of Antoin Duffy heard he was with Shaun McShane, 62, in Cathcart, Glasgow, on September 3.
The jury heard a bugged conversation from just before the visit when Duffy said: “It’s Shaun McShane, one of the Brighton bombers.
“He got six or seven years when Thatcher was blown up or nearly blown up.”
McShane, who moved from Donegal to Glasgow, was jailed in 1986 for his role in the plot. He told the court: “I wasn’t involved in the Brighton bombing. I admitted aiding and abetting.”
He said Duffy was having “problems with drink” and he visited him for a chat.
The jury also heard from PC Thomas McCafferty who searched Duffy’s cell at Castle Huntly open prison in October 2013, after Duffy and others were held in a counter-terrorism operation.
He said a copy of Adair’s book Mad Dog and a Gun Mart magazine were found.
Duffy, 39, Martin Hughes, 36, Paul Sands, 31, and John Gorman, 58, deny conspiring to murder Adair and his fellow ex-Ulster Freedom Fighters leader Sam “Skelly” McCrory, who live in Ayrshire.
Duffy and Gorman also deny plotting to kill the governor of Barlinnie jail.
Three other men deny organised crime charges. The trial at the High Court in Glasgow continues.

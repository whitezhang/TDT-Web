The Who close GlastonburyMUSIC veterans The Who closed a soggy and muddy Glastonbury festival tonight, taking campers back to the days of 60s rock and roll.The band, which famously performed at Woodstock in 1969, performed on the world-famous Pyramid stage, which hosted a headline show from Florence and the Machine on Friday and Kanye West the previous night.Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis said he was relieved to hear positive reviews of West's show after his daughter Emily received death threats for the booking, but admitted he did not watch the performance himself.Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama made his first-ever appearance at the diverse festival, where crowds sang happy birthday to the exiled Tibetan leader ahead of his 80th birthday next week.Other highlights today include Lionel Richie, Alt J, Paul Weller, FKA Twigs and the Chemical Brothers, whose performance directly clashed with The Who.Kanye West's expletive-filled performance on Saturday night saw a prankster invade the stage minutes in to his set.He told the audience: &quot;You are now watching the greatest living rock star on the planet.&quot;

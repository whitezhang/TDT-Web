A TEENAGE boy was &shy;fighting for his life last night after falling out of the back of a &shy;speeding milk van.
The 16-year-old, who has not been named, was knocked unconscious in the freak accident.
It’s understood the van’s doors flew open when the vehicle hit a speed bump.
Police have launched an investigation into the &shy;incident.
 The accident happened in Kilmarnock’s Carron &shy;Avenue at around 11.30pm on Thursday. 
Residents in the street say they had already &shy;complained to police about previous speeding incidents &shy;involving the van.
 Jim Gemmell, who lives in the street, said: “These roads aren’t the best and the milk van is guilty of speeding. 
“I suppose they’re all &shy;trying to get round their deliveries as quickly as &shy;possible.
“The van went round a wee bend, which shouldn’t be a problem if you’re sticking to the speed limit.
“But the boy was flung from the van and was knocked out at first, he didn’t know where he was.
“The van was about 40 yards down the road before the driver realised what &shy;happened.”
Yesterday, the youngster was “in a serious but stable condition” in hospital.

YORKHILL Children's Charity launched a grand prize draw with the help of a young leukaemia patient.The main prize - a &pound;12,000 Renault Clio donated by Arnold Clark - will tour Scotland wrapped in a special design created by 10-year-old Ryan Greenlees, a patient at Yorkhill.Services will begin transferring from Yorkhill to the new children's hospital in the South Side on Wednesday.Kirsten Sinclair, head of fundraising, Yorkhill Children's Charity, said: &quot;With the generosity of the public, the Grand Prize Draw will help us to fund &pound;75,000 of state-of-the-art equipment at the new Royal Hospital for Sick Children.&quot;We may be on the move but our mission to support families across Scotland continues. And when we move into our new home next week, our 200 volunteers will be on hand to provide information to families as they arrive.&quot;Ryan - who is from Alloa - was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was eight and is responding well to treatment, which still has one year to run.He attends weekly appointments in the day surgery at the hospital.Ryan's dad John, said: &quot;We're so proud that Ryan's design was selected to go onto the car. In fact, I've asked if we can buy it!&quot;He's benefited so much from the support of Yorkhill Children's Charity so we are thrilled to be involved with their Grand Prize Draw.&quot;Yorkhill Children's Charity has already funded more than &pound;5million in equipment and service delivery at the new hospital including a &pound;1m interactive play area which is the first of its kind in Europe.

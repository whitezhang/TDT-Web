Protest over council plan to cut free school transportA LABOUR councillor is fighting against his party’s proposals to remove bus passes from school children despite voting in favour of them earlier this year.Rashid Hussain, who looks after the Pollok Ward, has vowed to help 185 youngsters who will not be eligible for free school bus travel from August.The plans to change the eligibility for free transport to three miles for secondary pupils and 2.2 miles for primary pupils were set out in the 2015/16 Labour administration budget.Councillor Hussain voted in favour of the plans during the council budget meeting in February.He said: “I’m representing my constituents and I’m trying to help the parents most affected by this decision.“I’m not fighting the administration, I’m just trying to help the parents and alleviate their concern.“It is fundamentally our children who are impacted by this.“My own children are impacted too.”Mr Hussain said around 80 parents in his ward have contacted him with concerns about the safety of the routes their children will be forced to walk should they not be able to take the bus.The group will be walking along the suggested routes with Councillor Hussain and Land and Environmental Services officers to illustrate their safety concerns.In some areas they say there is no pavement for children to walk on, while in other areas the lighting is poor.Lindsay Scott, whose daughter attends Hillpark Secondary, said: “As a visually impaired mother of one daughter it is not possible for me to accompany my daughter to school as I struggle crossing roads even at traffic lights and also find it hard to judge the speed of oncoming cars so this is a real worry for me.”Councillor Stephen Curran, Executive Member for Education and Young People said: “We are communicating with parents over these changes.“That includes new safe routes for each child eligible under the old distances – and a decision will be made on each one. “Where there are no safe walking routes to school - regardless of the distance - free school transport remains.”SNP councillor for Pollok David McDonald said: “Councillors always need to be honest in their dealings with constituents. Its shear hypocrisy for Councillor Hussain to be campaign against the councils cuts to school transportation when he and his Labour colleagues voted this cut through at the City budget meeting earlier in the year.”

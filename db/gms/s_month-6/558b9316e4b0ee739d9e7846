Gangsters going green for easy cashGLASGOW'S crime lords have moved into the &quot;green&quot; industry - using eco-friendly businesses to launder money.The gangsters are exploiting a boom in the industry and have latched on in a bid to get their hands on government grants.However, cash from legitimate &quot;green&quot; grants is thought to be a tiny fraction of the money that goes through the books.Police insiders believe the rest is the proceeds of crime.Detective Superintendent Andy Gunn, head of the Organised Crime Unit in Glasgow, said: &quot;Where there is money to be made, these people will move in and capitalise on that.&quot;Recently we have seen an increase in their involvement with recycling and green energy firms.&quot;They will move in to these areas because see an opportunity for supply, demand and profit.&quot;Serious and organised criminals are driven by power and profit.&quot;All they care about is making money and the consequences of crimes are irrelevant to them.&quot;The Evening Times understands &quot;green&quot; loans and grants, which provide finance to companies pursuing environmentally-friendly projects, are seen as a big attraction to gangsters.Senior officers said that crime bosses were trying to make the same inroads into eco-friendly firms as they have already done in private hire taxis and tanning salons.Crime gang members believe moving into legitimate business offers a safer form of business.A police source said: &quot;Recycling companies and waste management are seen as a safer option.&quot;If you get caught dealing drugs, you can face years in jail. These firms remove that risk.&quot;The &quot;green&quot; loans are also a big incentive as it gives them the cash to get their &quot;legitimate&quot; business up and running.&quot;The Evening Times previously revealed police have identified almost 50 active gangs in the city and have seized more than &pound;13 million in illegal assets.Currently, Glasgow is home to 900 gangsters working across 48 underworld mobs.We also recently told how criminals are now running sweet shops as money-laundering operations.A crack crime squad has arrested 570 city mobsters and seized more than &pound;13 million in illegal assets.Rackets include drugs, prostitution, money laundering, tobacco smuggling, counterfeit goods, extortion and the use of legitimate businesses across all sectors.&quot;They will identify a weakness in an individual or community and capitalise on that.&quot;They don't care about the risk or harm to other people.&quot;They only care about profit.&quot;In recent years, gangsters have been forced out of the taxi trade by tough laws and enhanced legislation.Detectives have been working with prosecutors and council chiefs to stop organised crime taking over private hire firms and using them as a cover for money laundering, drug dealing and prostitution.Mr Gunn said recent action to crackdown gangsters trying to muscle in on taxi firms had been &quot;successful&quot; but warned there is more work to be done.He said: &quot;As we get more successful at stopping them, they look to adapt and move into

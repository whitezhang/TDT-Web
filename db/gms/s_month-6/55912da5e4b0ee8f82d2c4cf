Meet the Scottish couple who are set to appear on Come Dine With MeA Scottish couple who are set to appear on the Channel 4 hit Come Dine With Me only applied to the show after seeing a story on the Evening Times online.Cat Ure (31) and Martin Langer (39), from Bonnybridge, will make a splash on the popular tea time show couples edition which they appear on this week.Viewers will see Cat &nbsp;blow her top after discovering the beef is undercooked and the panicked host even flame grilled her own kitchen equipment.Cat said:&nbsp; “We’ve always been fans of the show, we’ve watched it for years and when we bought our new house we were particularly excited about the fact it had a separate dining room. One of the first things I said was, “We can go on Come Dine With Me because we’ve got a dining room!”“I was tagged in a Facebook status posted by The Evening Times with people saying our dinners always looked nice so we thought, “What’s the worst that can happen? Let’s go for it!” We both love hosting informal dinner parties for our friends, so doing it for two new couples on the TV didn’t faze us.”She added: “It was definitely an experience! We loved meeting the other couples that was one of the things we were most looking forward to.“I thought I worked well under pressure before going on the show, but as the episode will show, maybe that isn’t the case.“The pressure was all me though, I just wanted to serve an amazing meal and impress everyone, regardless of whether there was cameras there or not.“Going to the other couples houses was great, we can honestly say that every meal was nice, we were so glad not to get served something that we hated. It’s an experience that we’ll never forget!”The pair will be joined by other Scottish couples Gill and Mark, and Matt And Derek – and it seemed unlike some Come Dine With Me episodes, they have all hit it off since filming the show.Cat said: “Both couples were amazing; we genuinely couldn’t have been put with better people.“We all had sore faces from laughing so much each night, everybody had a great sense of humour and we spent most of the time laughing.“Gill and Mark are lovely, really down to earth people and Mark is full of amazing one-liners.“Matt and Derek were brilliant as well, their relationship dynamic is great. We’ve all stayed in touch after filming and were out for a group dinner a few weeks back, we’ve definitely got some good friends out of the show.”The couple can’t wait for the show to go live this week and seem unfazed by the reaction they are likely to get.Cat said: “I’m not worried at all, I’ve said ever since it filmed “people that know me know I’m crazy anyway!”“I don’t think anyone that knows me will watch the show and think, “She’s a bit nuts”, because they’ll already be aware I’m crazy.“I’m not bothered about the general public thinking I’m nuts cause it’s an accurate description!”Martin added: “I think people will watch the show and possibly feel sorry for me, because I’m stuck with Cat!“I’ll come across as the calm one in the relationship, with the patience of a saint.”Cat in particular is fully aware her five minutes of fame may be a negative one, adding, “If I’m known as ‘that crazy woman that had a meltdown on Couples Come Dine With Me’ for years to come, then so be it!”

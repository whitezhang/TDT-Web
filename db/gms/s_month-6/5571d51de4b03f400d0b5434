MORE resources will be made available to help people cut down harmful levels of drinking, Scotland's Public Health Minister has announced.&nbsp;A new campaign on the effects of adults drinking has on children will be launched and other measures aimed at tackling problem drinking among the population.Maureen Watt, Public Health Minister, said the strategy would build on the progress already made on tackling alcohol abuse, but said she was concerned by a recent increase in alcohol related deaths.Ms Watt led a debate in the Scottish Parliament on the next steps to combat alcoholism.She announced a package of measures including funding a new post with Alcohol Focus Scotland to look at how the licensing system can be used to control the availability of alcohol.A social marketing campaign will targets parents to ensure they recognise they are seen as role models for their children and their behaviour will be emulated by them.More Alcohol Brief Interventions will be carried out where people are questioned about their drinking habits in a bid to encourage them to cut down to save on more costly hospital treatment in the future.Ms Watt said: &quot;&quot;Scotland's relationship with alcohol is deeply concerning. While alcohol-related deaths have fallen by 35 per cent since 2008, they remain 1.4 times higher than they were in 1981. The most recent data, for 2013, shows an increase.&quot;Evaluation shows that the action we've taken is having an impact on Scotland's relationship with alcohol and it's now time to look at the next steps we take to further that progress. This debate starts the conversation on the next phase of our alcohol strategy.&quot;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says that the majority of adults in the west of Scotland drinks at &quot;risky&quot; levels and most do so without realising.Alcohol Brief Interventions are used to identify risky drinking patterns then offer ways of support to help people reduce their drinking.Ms Watt said that last year 14 104,356 alcohol brief interventions were carried out in Scotland, exceeding the target by 71 per cent, but that more would be offered.

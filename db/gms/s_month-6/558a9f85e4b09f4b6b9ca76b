Ex-Dragons' Den star Bannatyne: I never intended to leak naked photos of exFormer Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has admitted that he regrets sending a text which suggested that he would leak naked photographs of his ex - but that he did not mean it.The multi-millionaire businessman, 66, has publicly fallen out with former girlfriend Michelle Evans, a beauty queen who dumped him on Twitter with the famous Dragons' Den phrase &quot;I'm out!&quot;When Evans, 37, alleged that the tycoon implied he would leak naked photographs of her, Bannatyne tweeted: &quot;I hear there is a bunny boiler on the loose in UK?&quot;Now Bannatyne has appeared on This Morning with his new, young girlfriend Nigora Whitehorn, who he has been dating for around three weeks - and hinted that the loved-up couple could marry.Evans said that she ended her seven-month relationship with Bannatyne after coming across photographs of the tycoon with Uzbekistan-born dental worker Whitehorn.But Bannatyne denied cheating on Evans, saying: &quot;One of the papers printed a picture of Nigora and I having dinner together. We weren't in a relationship. We were just friends and Michelle just went mad and that was it.&quot;And he said of the text referring to Evans' naked pictures: &quot;Obviously that was a mistake but she was threatening to tell the story and I (said) 'Well, are you happy for me to send a picture to show the pictures?&quot;It (the text) doesn't say I'm going to send the pictures. I never intended to send the pictures.... I wouldn't do that.&quot;Bannatyne said of meeting Whitehorn: &quot;I was getting my teeth done.... I'd had my last treatment. I'd left and spoken to her and thought she's so beautiful I was falling in love with her without even knowing her.&quot;I spent two weeks at home thinking I must see this woman again....I went to the doctor's. The doctor sent me to get an X-ray. I'm walking back...and I see her on that side of the street.&quot;The couple said that they were &quot;madly in love&quot; and that they could get married despite the fact that Bannatyne's children have not yet met Whitehorn.She called Bannatyne &quot;the most generous man I've ever met in my life&quot;, adding: &quot;I'm very much in love.&quot;Bannatyne, who sat with his hand on his girlfriend's knee, hinted that the couple could marry, telling hosts Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: &quot;Get your hat ready.&quot;When Schofield asked &quot;what was it that first attracted you to multi-millionaire Duncan Bannatyne?&quot;, Whitehorn replied: &quot;When Duncan arrived in our clinic I knew that he was on Dragons' Den. I didn't really know much about you then but then I've then read your books and I was quite impressed.&quot;Bannatyne compared himself to an excited schoolboy and denied that he was bitter about the acrimonious fall-out from his last relationship, saying: &quot;You don't feel bitter when you're madly in love....I'm just an excited schoolboy.&quot;

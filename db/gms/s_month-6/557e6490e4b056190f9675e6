THE founder of troubled arts venue The Arches, which has called in administrators, has warned that Glasgow's cultural profile will be damaged by its loss.Andy Arnold, who founded The Arches in 1991, said he was &quot;extremely sad&quot; about what has happened at the venue, which he described as a &quot;breeding ground&quot; for artistic talent.The Arches announced on Wednesday that it would appoint administrators following the forced closure of its nightclub.Management said they were ''left with no other choice'' after licensing bosses in Glasgow ruled last month that the venue will have to close at midnight every day over a series of police complaints about drug misuse and disorder.The nightclub generated more than half of The Arches' annual turnover but early closing times have made the business model ''untenable''.Mr Arnold said: &quot;I'm extremely sad that this has happened and feel particularly for the long-serving and hard-working staff.&quot;Most of all, Glasgow has lost a unique and extraordinary arts venue - a breeding ground for so much artistic talent - and the cultural profile of this city will be damaged as a result.&quot;Almost 40,000 people have signed a petition calling for the reinstatement of the venue's licence and a group of 400 creative voices, including author Irvine Welsh, members of Mogwai, Belle &amp; Sebastian and Franz Ferdinand, also signed an open letter calling on the Government and creative bodies to ensure The Arches remains as an arts venue.Police raised licensing issues last year after the drugs-related death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl at the club and a number of other incidents.The club agreed to implement a number of measures and it remained open, but issues were raised again recently.The Scottish Government has said it will do all it can to help the venue.

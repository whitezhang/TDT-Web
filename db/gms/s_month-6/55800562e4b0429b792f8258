FLEETWOOD Mac’s concert at the Glasgow SSE Hydro arena will definitely go ahead, after the band cancelled a date last week due to illness. 
Fans of the rock group hit out at event organisers after booking fees were reportedly not funded and hundreds of gig-goers had shelled out for travel and accommodation.
But the quintet, famed for hits including The Chain, Go Your Own Way and Little Lies, will definitely perform to thousands of Scots music lovers at the 13,000-capacity arena in Glasgow tonight.
The band will be joined by Christine McVie after a 16-year absence and are expected to play for around two hours. 
Confirmation of the gig going ahead comes as doubt remains over the certainty of the Foo Fighters concert at BT Murrayfield stadium going ahead as planned next week.
Frontman Dave Grohl fractured his leg in a fall during a gig in Sweden, and although he carried on and completed the concert, the band cancelled appearances at the Pinkpop Festival and at the AFG Arena in St Gallen in Switzerland.
No announcement has been made regarding the gig but Murrayfield chiefs are confident that the show will go ahead as planned ‘as things stand’. 
It was also revealed this morning that ‘music tourism’ boosts the Scottish economy to the tune of &pound;280 million a year.

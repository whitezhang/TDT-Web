Glasgow Art School graduates work on showTWO talented graduates who lost work during the Art School blaze have been honoured with a special exhibition.Former students Alexander Jensen and Nicola Massie are putting on a show of their work after winning a prestigious award.The pair, who graduated last year from the art school, will exhibit their pieces at Glasgow's Royal Glasgow Institute (RGI) gallery until Saturday June 27.Nicola, painting graduate from Aberdeen has a number of screen prints, etchings and photographs on display in the Douglas Street gallery alongside her fellow student Alex's more abstract work.Around half of the work she had created was destroyed during the art school fire which tore through the Mackintosh building in May last year.Nicola said: &quot;I had wallpaper I had made which I lost, and a wall full of prints on paper and a lot of resin blocks that were water damaged.“I did manage to salvage a few things though.”The 23-year-old said the RGI exhibit was her first proper exhibition and it gave her a chance to expose her work to a wider range of people.She said: &quot;I've always been really interested in the city and recording human activity around the city.&quot;I've been trying to record the movement of people around the streets and in crowds in Glasgow and that's what is reflected in the exhibition.&quot;My work is in layers, using pinhole camera photography and other images. It feels like it's a short glimpse of what has happened.&quot;Alex, a 25-year-old Danish student also graduated from the school last year despite losing almost all of his work in the blaze, including sketch books and original pieces.Jean McFadden, President of RGI said: &quot;This year’s Graduate Prize Exhibition is very special as the graduates, Nicola and Alexander, were among those who lost work in last year’s tragic fire at Glasgow School of Art and the RGI is delighted to give them the opportunity to showcase their talents.&quot;One of the RGI’s objectives is to encourage contemporary art and I hope this exhibition will promote these two artists’ work to a wider audience.&quot;I wish them every success.&quot;

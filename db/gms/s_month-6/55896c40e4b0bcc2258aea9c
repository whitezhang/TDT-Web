TWO transport bosses have enjoyed a &pound;4300 Italian junket at taxpayers’ expense.
The bigwigs from SPT, who run Glasgow’s Subway, spent &pound;1350 each on tickets to a transport congress and exhibition and &pound;845 each on flights and hotels.
The sums don’t include their food and drink.
SPT were slammed last year for offering workers a 0.9 per cent pay rise tied to sick pay cuts and imposing unpopular shift patterns.
And Eddie Duffy of the Unite union branded the Milan trip by chief executive Gordon Maclennan and his deputy Eric Stewart “disgusting”.
He said: “We’re in dispute with this company about their draconian treatment of workers and now the great and the good are off sunning themselves again. They have no shame.”
The two bosses jetted off last week to the UITP World Congress and Mobility &amp; City Transport Exhibition.
The board approved the trip after Maclennan told them SPT needed to “keep abreast of strategies” in the transport industry.
SPT have a long history of junkets. Several bosses including chief exeutive Ron Culley quit in 2010 after anger over lavish trips and “unacceptable” expenses.
The Record told last year how Maclennan took six senior staff to Canada, Spain and London, followed by another trip to Denmark, Switzerland and Austria.
SPT defended those trips, and did the same yesterday when asked about the Milan jaunt. A spokeswoman said: “UITP brings together transport professionals from all over the world. It is important SPT benefits from this exchange of knowledge.”

College slammed for excessive pay outs to bossesA COLLEGE has been slammed for excessive severance pay-outs to its senior management team.Audit Scotland criticised Coatbridge College for cash paid to its former principal and six of his top team.Between them the seven pocketed &pound;850,000 the same amount as was shared between the other 26 staff who were made redundant when the college merged with others to create New College Lanarkshire.The Auditor General said that the college had failed to meet standards expected in the use of public money and the payments to the management had exceeded the terms of the college severance scheme.The total cost of the severance deals for 33 staff was &pound;1.7million. The seven received &pound;849, 842 between them leaving &pound;850,158 for the remaining 26 staff who also left.An investigation found that the college Remuneration Committee had agreed it would reduce the maximum lump sum to 13 months for all staff including the senior management, in line with other colleges involved in the merger.However the senior staff were still paid the enhanced terms which amounted to 21 months salary.The Principal, John Doyle, was paid more. His deal included and extra three months for taking the college through to the merger. He was also granted six months pay in lieu of notice.In her report, Caroline Gardner, Auditor General, said: “There is no evidence that the Remuneration Committee or the Board were provided with detailed business cases setting out the costs and justification for severance payments to the Principal, five members of the senior management team or the member of staff in the Principal’s office.“The payments also included payments for annual leave which the auditor could not verify.”Before the severance payments were finalised the senior team were given pay rises and salary enhancements of up to 10% which were included when calculating the final sum.The Auditor General added: “There is limited evidence of the reasons for these additional payments and of the decisions to awards them.”Coatbridge College merged with Motherwell College and Cumbernauld College to create the New College Lanarkshire, with campuses in the three towns and one in Kirkintilloch with 25,000 students across a range of courses.

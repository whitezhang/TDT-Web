GLASGOW nightclub Jumpin Jaks could be redeveloped under plans to build student flats in Sauchiehall Street.As part of a large-scale project, developers want to transform the site from 294 to 300 Sauchiehalll Street, which also takes in Yates bar.The plans have not yet been lodged with Glasgow City Council and are currently in the pre-application stage.A published notice stated that the redevelopment concerned 294 - 330 Sauchiehall Street. This led to fears that the ABC, which is number 300, would be redeveloped.Over 1,800 people signed a petition calling for the ABC to be saved.But the owners of the site have assured that they will protect the ABC and plan to invest in the venue if they get the go ahead.The early planning proposal states that owners will seek permission for the &quot;partial demolition of existing building and erection of mixed use development comprising managed student accommodation, retail, financial and professional services, food and drink, business, non-residential institution, public house, hot food takeaway with associated amenity and servicing&quot;.It is not yet known how many flats could be built..A spokesperson for the owner of 294-300 Sauchiehall Street said: &quot;We would like to reassure people that we are fully committed to the future of the ABC as a thriving and popular music venue.&quot;There are no plans to close the ABC and its reassuring to know that so many people feel as strongly as we do.&quot;Our proposals, which are at a very early stage, are to look at the 1960s-built part of the building currently occupied by Jumpin Jaks and Yates, with the possibility of new student accommodation.&quot;The intention to submit a planning application was made as we are also considering improvements and investment to the ABC which would require planning approval.&quot;Developers have vowed to consult with the public over the plans.They will go on show at the CCA, 350 Sauchiehall Street on Wednesday from 3.30pm to 8pm.

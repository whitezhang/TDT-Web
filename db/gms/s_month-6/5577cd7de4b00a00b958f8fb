THE family of a woman brutally murdered in her own home publicly relived their ordeal as they took their fight for the introduction of 'life means life' jail sentences to Holyrood.Isabelle Sanders, 51, was murdered by Paul McManus, then 19, during a robbery at her home in Crookston, Glasgow, in April last year.Her brother, James Dougall, told MSPs she suffered 37 stab wounds and 64 individual injuries in the fatal attack, which occurred after McManus knocked on her door armed with two knives and forced his way in.After failing to steal a car, he fled with &pound;300 in cash, a decanter filled with whisky and a laptop.McManus, who was also convicted of attempting to murder Ms Sanders's partner, then 85, who he stabbed three times, was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 26 years before he can be released.After his trial, it emerged he had been released from serving a previous sentence five weeks before the murder and had a significant criminal record.Mr Dougall brought a petition to the Scottish Parliament's Public Petitions Committee, calling for a law change so violent reoffenders can be jailed with no possibility of ever being released.He told MSPs the sentence imposed on his sister's killer meant he could be released as a &quot;relatively young, fit man&quot; of 45, the same age as him and six years younger than Ms Sanders was when she was murdered.He accepted the possibility of a whole-life sentence would not act as a deterrent to the most dangerous criminals, but said it would ensure they could not commit further crimes after being released and protect the public.Mr Dougall added: &quot;This individual has already been given the opportunity to reform, how can we be sure that if we do release him he won't offend again?&quot;We raised the petition to protect other families from similar situations.&quot;At present, murderers receive a mandatory life sentence, comprised of a minimum jail term after which a prisoner can be released at the discretion of the Parole Board on licence, or kept in prison if they are deemed too risky to let out.The family is calling for judges to be given the ability to sentence offenders committing the most horrific crimes where efforts at rehabilitation have previously failed to whole life terms, with no possibility of release, a feature of the justice system south of the border.Currently, Scots law allows for the possibility that the minimum period of custody may exceed the prisoner's life expectancy, but it must be specified in years and months.Mr Dougall said the provision was rarely used, with the only case he could find where it had been applied that of Angus Sinclair, who was convicted of the 1977 World's End murders of teenagers Christine Eadie and Helen Scott in October 2014.Sentenced to a minimum prison term of 37 years, Sinclair would be 106 years old before being eligible for parole.Former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill, who now sits on the petitions committee, said the current system allowed life prisoners to be recalled to jail at any point after being released for minor infringements.Mr Dougall accepted Mr MacAskill's point that this allowed the Parole Board to exercise a degree of control but said a small proportion of violent life criminals released on licence would go on to commit further serious offences regardless.MSPs agreed to write to the Scottish Government to ask if the matter would be appropriate for the new Scottish Sentencing Council to consider.The council is due to be established by October this year to provide clear sentencing guidelines for Scotland.They also agreed to write to Mr MacAskill's successor, Michael Matheson, to establish how often a sentence which was manifestly longer than the offender's life expectancy had been imposed by judges.Following the hearing, Mr Dougall said he was keen to secure a meeting with Mr Matheson after previous attempts to meet with ministers had proved impossible while the court case was in progress. McManus was sentenced in January.He added: &quot;They certainly heard our case and I hope they follow through on the actions they've spoken about. I think public opinion would be that in some cases it (a whole-life custodial sentence) does show that justice has been done.&quot;Lindsay Dougall, Ms Sanders's sister, also attended the hearing.She said: &quot;We won't ever get over what happened. It's still unbelievable, even a year after it happened. When you go to your house you expect to be safe.&quot;

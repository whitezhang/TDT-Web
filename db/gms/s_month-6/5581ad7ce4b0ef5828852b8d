Police investigating the murder of a man who was found seriously injured on a Glasgow street want to trace a car seen near where he was found.
Albert Anthony Smith McDonald, 58, was found with head injuries on Cumbernauld Road, Riddrie, at 21:25 on Monday. He died on his way to hospital.
Detectives want to trace a small burgundy car seen in the area at 21:30.
Police said Mr McDonald's family were &quot;completely devastated&quot; by his death and appealed for information.
Senior investigating officer Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie said: &quot;We are following up several lines of enquiry, including speaking to local residents and accessing CCTV from around Cumbernauld Road and the surrounding area.
&quot;I would like to trace the owner and occupants of a small burgundy coloured car which was seen nearby around the time of the discovery of Mr McDonald. 
&quot;They may have information which could be critical to the investigation.&quot;
Det Ch Insp McLuckie said &quot;Mr McDonald had significant injuries&quot; when he was found and the investigating team was &quot;trying to establish just how he sustained them&quot;.
She said officers were trying to piece together his last known movements. 
&quot;Understandably his family and friends are completely devastated, and specialist officers are providing them with support at this tragic time,&quot; she said.
&quot;It is imperative we find who is responsible for Albert's death. 
&quot;I would ask anyone who was in the vicinity of Cumbernauld Road around 2130 hours or earlier, and who may have seen anything suspicious to come forward to police.&quot; 
Det Ch Insp McLuckie added: &quot;You may think that the information you have is insignificant however it may be the piece of information we are looking for.&quot;

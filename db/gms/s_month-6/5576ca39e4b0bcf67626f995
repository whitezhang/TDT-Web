POLICE chiefs last night released CCTV images of a knife thug they are hunting following two armed robberies.
Detectives in Paisley hope someone will recognise the dangerous brute who targeted an off-licence and grocery store.
The hooded raider held up Co-op Food, in Kilbarchan’s High Barholm, where he threatened staff with a weapon at around 8.35pm on February 28.
It’s understood he stole a three-figure sum of money from the till during the robbery, which left workers badly shaken. Two weeks later, he targeted a One-O-One off sales, in Kilbarchan Road, Johnstone, again at around 8.35pm.
During that robbery, he accosted a 29-year-old sales assistant with what is believed to have been a knife before making off with a three-figure sum of cash.
On that occasion, the thief fled on foot before getting into a silver car and speeding off in the direction of Kilbarchan.
 

Police last night said: “Police are investigating two robberies at local shops in Renfrewshire.
“The first incident occurred on February 28 at the Co-operative, 20A High Bar Holm, Kilbarchan, and the second incident occurred on March 14 at One-O-One Offsales, 32 Kilbarchan Road, Johnstone.
“They have today released images of a man that they wish to speak to in connection with their investigation.
“The man is described as being around 5”6 to 5”8 in height, medium/well built with a distinctive nose and chin. He was wearing a dark hooded top, dark tracksuit bottoms and black trainers.”

IMMIGRATION officers have staged a series of raids at Paisley businesses as part of a crackdown against illegal workers.
A Home Office team, supported by Paisley cops, swooped on five restaurants and take-away shops within a matter of hours.
Businesses in Broomlands Street and Old Sneddon Street were targeted and it’s understood five men were detained.
They now face the prospect of being deported from the UK.
Another man was questioned at a shop in Paisley’s High Street but was not detained.
Officers also visited two businesses in Johnston Street as part of the operation, although no action was taken against any workers at those premises.
 One resident in Broomlands Street told the Paisley Daily Express how he watched a raid take place at the Master Chef take-away near his home. 
 The man, who asked not to be named, said: “I looked out of my window and there was a police van and some immigration officers outside the take-away shop. 
 

 
“After a while, they put three guys in the van and drove off.”
A neighbour added: “At first, I thought there had been an accident.
“It was only later on I was told it was something to do with immigration.
“The shutters at the Master Chef shop were down at the time, so I couldn’t see what was happening inside.”
 A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed local officers supported an operation on Thursday afternoon as part of an effort to tackle illegal workers but declined to comment further. 
When the Express contacted the Home Office, a spokesman said: “The enforcement activity was a Police Scotland operation and we are unable to comment.”
No-one was available for comment when a reporter visited Master Chef.
Businesses face a &pound;20,000 fine for each illegal worker being employed, unless they can provide proof that appropriate checks were carried out.

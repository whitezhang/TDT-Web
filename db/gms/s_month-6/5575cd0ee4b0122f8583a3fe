A NOTORIOUS trunk road bottleneck is to be improved as part of the plan which will deliver roads improvements on the A9, A82 and the A96.
The Longman roundabout in Inverness, the convergence of the A9 and A82, is to be “grade separated” to provide a free-flowing junction with slip-roads and a fly-over.
The roundabout, on the south side of the Kessock Bridge, has been identified as a priority in the A96 Connections study which is yet to be published.
 The A96 Inverness to Aberdeen route is to be fully upgraded to dual carriageway as part of the plan to upgrade the A9 to the same standard from Perth to Inverness. 
The Longman roundabout was the scene of huge delays when the Kessock Bridge was being resurfaced and more recently when Academy Street in the city was closed because of a fire.
 Infrastructure Secretary Keith Brown said:“The Scottish Government wants to see improvements to our roads infrastructure right across the country to help support Scotland’s economy, and better connect our cities. 
“It is why we have committed to and are pressing ahead with a major programme of works to dual the A9 and A96, amounting to nearly 170 miles of upgraded road.
“We also recognise that where these roads meet in our highland capital it is essential to provide the high quality road infrastructure needed to support economic growth and improve journey times for road users in and around Inverness.
“The study is also recommending grade separation of the A9/A82 Longman roundabout which will offer significant benefits, including road safety and journey time improvements, to those travelling on the key strategic routes of the A82, A9 and A96.”

YOUNGSTERS from across Glasgow received special awards for their knowledge of sailing.Children from Chirnsyde, Saracen and St Monica's primary schools received the awards from the Lord Provost Sadie Docherty at the City Chambers.The presentation was the climax of a programme called Buoyed Up, organised by the charitable foundation inspired by Sir Thomas Lipton.Sir Thomas was born in the Gorbals and started a chain of grocery shops, and became one of Scotland's first global entrepreneurs selling his own branded tea.He was also renowned for his perseverance and sportsmanship in five unsuccessful challenges to win sailing's premier trophy, the America's Cup, before his death in 1931.He was granted the Freedom of the City of Glasgow in 1923.As part of the Buoyed Up programme, pupils undertook a classroom topic on the life of Sir Thomas, learning about sailing, the America's Cup, and what it means to be an entrepreneur.The next stage of Buoyed Up provided a 'World Of Work' experience.Chief Executive of V Ships, Matt Dunlop, and his senior team set aside half a day to deliver interactive workshops on maritime life and many different career paths in the shipping industry for one group of pupils; while City of Glasgow College staff, lecturers and cadets, performed a similar role for the other two schools.

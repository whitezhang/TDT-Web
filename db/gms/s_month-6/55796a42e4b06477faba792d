 A BRIDE-TO-BE was left heartbroken when thieves stole her wedding gifts just before her big day. 
Donna Vergoz said “I do” to new husband Chris, 35, on Saturday after putting aside her disappointment at losing personalised picture frames, wallets and teddy bears when crooks targeted her car.
The 38-year-old made an emotional online appeal for their return before her wedding but it proved fruitless.
 However, Donna, who holds down jobs in a lawyers’ office and with Pizza Hut, told the thieves they didn’t manage to spoil her big day in Rutherglen , Glasgow . 
She said: “It was a lovely day, the best day of my life, just unforgettable.
“I wouldn’t give whoever did this the satisfaction of ruining my day.”
Despite her positive outlook, Donna admits that the theft was a devastating experience for her, Chris and their daughters Sophie, 10, and Megan, 14.
Sophie was so upset she put a balloon with a face on it at her bedroom window to deter intruders.
Donna, who still has no idea how the thieves managed to get into the car, was grateful for the response to her online plea, even though it was to no avail.
She told our sister paper the Rutherglen Reformer: “There are definitely more good, nice and caring people in the community than bad. I was amazed at how people responded.”
But Donna remains especially distraught about one particular item that was taken – a tiara belonging to a friend of a workmate.
She said: “I don’t even know her but now I’ve got to tell her it’s been stolen. It has sentimental value.”

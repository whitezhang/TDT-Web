 The Government have been warned that they face a massive payout if they fail to warn women who have been given a defective mesh device by the NHS. 
Ministers have said they will not begin to contact women who may have been given implants considered dangerous in the US until after a safety review.
 Last week the Sunday Mail revealed that six of the country’s 11 health boards had used a device at the centre of a $100million payout in America. 
 
 

The boards used either Advantage Fit or Pinnacle implants manufactured by Boston Scientific who were found negligent in the design of both in a case which saw Deborah Barba given the massive award.
As well as the products, one of the most used devices in Scotland, Ethicon’s TVT-O, has twice been found defective by US courts.
Now campaigners want to establish a clearer picture of which patients in Scotland were given the treatments for bladder and pelvic organ prolapse.
 Lothians Labour MSP Neil Findlay and East Renfrewshire Conservative MSP Jackson Carlaw have lodged motions in the  Scottish Parliament urging action over women given any of the devices. 
 

 
Scottish Mesh Survivor spokeswoman Olive McIlroy, 57, from Renfrew, said: “The Government have a legal duty to ensure patients weren’t harmed.
“They must do the right thing now.”
A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “This review will report in the summer and will allow a thorough assessment of the evidence.”

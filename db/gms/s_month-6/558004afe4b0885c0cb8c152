PALS have paid tribute to a teenager tragically killed in a fireball road smash.
Jordan Milne, 18, was alone in his black MG when it was involved in a collision with a silver Mercedes.
His car landed on its roof and burst into flames.
Jordan died at the scene of the crash on the Kincardine O’Neil-Aboyne road, near his home in Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire.
On social media, friend Eilidh Mutch said: “Rest in peace. I remember you fondly from school. Such a horrible thing to happen. Thinking of your family.”
Oakley Isaac added: “Can’t believe I’m even writing this Jordan Milne, it just doesn’t seem real.
“You were such a genuine, lovely guy to know and grow up with.
“You will be missed so much. Rest in peace, Jordan, sleep tight.”
Another pal posted: “RIP Jordan, you were a good loon and will be missed loads.”
Four people, two men and two women, travelling in the Mercedes are believed to have been on their way home from a wedding reception.
 They were taken to  Aberdeen Royal Infirmary but their injuries were not life-threatening. 
One resident said she was awoken by the noise of the collision at 1am on Sunday. Amy Poor, 29, opened her door to see the MG had become “a ball of fire”.
She said: “I heard what I though were fireworks and we saw a car going up in flames.
“It was on its roof and the car was a ball of fire.
“It is the family I feel for. One or two months ago we had an accident in the exact same spot.
“It must have gone up in flames within minutes. Someone came over and asked for a blanket. There was so many ambulances, firefighters and police.”
Two fire crews were scrambled to the scene and put out the car fire.
The A93 was closed for eight hours to enable the wreckage to be cleared and allow crash investigators to examine the scene.
Police said yesterday inquiries were “ongoing”.

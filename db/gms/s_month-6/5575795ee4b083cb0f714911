Donald Trump to visit South Ayrshire’s Turnberry Golf Course with son Eric
Trip comes just days after the billionaire lost latest legal battle against offshore wind farm near Menie Estate course
Trump has previously threatened to pull plug on plans to further develop Balmedie result if wind farm plans proceed
US billionaire Donald Trump is to visit Scotland just days after losing the latest legal battle against an offshore wind farm near his Aberdeenshire golf resort.
Mr Trump will be joined by his son Eric on a visit to the Turnberry Golf Course in South Ayrshire that he bought last year.
The resort has been undergoing refurbishment and the pair are due to unveil a multimillion-pound transformation of the clubhouse.
Last week the property developer was dealt a fresh blow in his campaign against an 11-turbine wind farm off the coast of his luxury golf links at the Menie Estate.
The plans were approved by the Scottish Government in 2013 but are bitterly opposed by Mr Trump, who claims the scheme will spoil the view at his resort.
The Trump Organisation went to Edinburgh’s Court of Session for a review of the decision by Scottish ministers not to hold a public inquiry on the wind farm application and their decision to grant consent for the project.
The petition was dismissed in February last year and Scotland’s most senior judge, Lord Gill, ruled on Friday that the earlier decision was legal.
Mr Trump has previously said he will pull the plug on plans to further develop his resort near Balmedie if the wind farm goes ahead.
The Trump Organisation has pledged to continue its legal challenge at the UK Supreme Court and the European Courts.

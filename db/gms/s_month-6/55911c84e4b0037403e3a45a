 PRISON bosses separated two of Scotland’s most notorious gangland killers after one fingered the other in an unsolved murder. 
Gunman Jamie McDonald claimed fellow murderer Garry Smith was linked to the mystery deaths of two of his pals more than 15 years go.
 McDonald, 41, is now being kept apart from other lags at Low Moss prison, near Glasgow , because he fears repercussions. It’s understood that he believes 37-year-old Smith – described as “top dog” in the prison – was involved in the murders of John Nisbet and William Lindsay. 
 Their charred bodies were found in a field in East Lothian in 1999. 
Smith’s brother Lee was the prime suspect in the killings until his death in 2006.
But a prison insider told the Record that McDonald – serving 30 years for shooting dead underworld figure Michael Lyons – spoke to prison bosses and implicated Smith.
Since then, he has feared for his safety and is being kept in segregation.
The source said: “The boy McDonald is now in fear for his life and is scared to come into the hall. Smith is the top dog here and everyone does what he says.”
The Scottish Prison Service refused to comment.

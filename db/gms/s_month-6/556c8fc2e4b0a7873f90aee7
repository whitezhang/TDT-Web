AUSSIE social media stars The Janoskians have announced a mischief filled European tour for this year.
 The Melbourne pop punkers, who always have a few tricks up their sleeves, kick off The Jahoo Jahaa Tour this August and come to Glasgow’s 02 Academy on September 2. 
With more than 20 dates, the five lads – who have more than 200 million combined views online – are hoping to keep the momentum going after reaching the top of the UK iTunes chart within 24 hours of the release of their latest EP Would U Love Me.
It also follows a massive Wembley Arena show in March that entertained a sold-out crowd.

The music makers cum stuntmen, who once had a singalong with their fans outside the Hilton hotel in Glasgow, also continue to work on their feature film with LionsGate, a book with Simon and Schuster and another soon to be announced secret project.
 Tickets for the UK shows go on sale at 9am on Friday June 5 from www.livenation.co.uk 
 VIP tickets will also be available from www.VIPNation.eu (all tickets subject to per-ticket charge plus order processing fee). 
A North American leg is planned as well.

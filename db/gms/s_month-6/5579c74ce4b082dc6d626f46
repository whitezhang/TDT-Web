MORE than a hundred years of medical history came to an end yesterday as Glasgow's Yorkhill hospital closed its doors to emergency patients.Patients began transferring to the South Glasgow University Hospital at 8am, a process which will continue over the next few days.The old site's accident and emergency unit was permanently closed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.Parents are now being advised to take their children to the A&amp;E unit at the new &pound;842m site in Govan.The state-of-the-art facility is part of Scotland's biggest hospital, the new South Glasgow University Hospital and Royal Hospital For Sick Children.Robert Calderwood, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Chief Executive, said: &quot;The new adult acute hospital and new RHSC have been a long time in the planning and construction, and I am delighted that they are now complete.&quot;The new RHSC has been designed to the make any child's visit to the hospital as pleasant as possible with a cinema, science centre, interactive activity walls, indoor and outdoor play areas and a roof garden.&quot;We hope that the children who move to the new hospital this week are as pleased with it as we are.&quot;

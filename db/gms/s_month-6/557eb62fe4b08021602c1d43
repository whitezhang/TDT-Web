A large fire at an industrial estate in South Lanarkshire has been brought under control, according to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.
About 25 firefighters tackled the blaze in a warehouse at the Farme Castle Estate in Rutherglen. It broke out shortly before midnight on Sunday.
The building was thought to contain about 30 vehicles with a risk that the blaze may spread to their fuel tanks.
Large clouds of smoke were reported by local residents in the area.
A spokesman for the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze had been brought under control, with one vehicle remaining at the scene to dampen down hotspots.
A joint investigation with Police Scotland will be carried out to establish the cause.

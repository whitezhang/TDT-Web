IT’LL be Still Game set and match for the stars of Scotland’s favourite comedy when Sanj Kohli and Greg Hemphill take part in a charity tennis match.
The duo, who play Victor McDade and Naveed Harrid in the telly comedy, are swapping Osprey Heights for Centre Court to raise funds for Elena Baltacha Tennis Foundation in a glamour clash this weekend.
They’ll be joined by Loose Woman Kaye Adams, TV weathergirl Judith Ralston, Scottish footie legend Alan Rough, sports presenter Alison Walker, Balamory actress Julie Wilson Nimmo and former Rangers midfielder Ian McCall.
Top coach Judy Murray will also be at Saturday’s match, at Western Tennis Club in Glasgow, and will join broadcaster Sally Magnusson to speak at the event, which will also raise funds for Playlist for Life and The Scottish Dementia Clinical Research Network charities.
Greg said: “It was a pleasure to humiliate myself last year by putting my tennis skills on display for such a good cause. This year I look forward to doing it again in front of one of the best tennis coaches in the country and the mother of two of the game’s best players.”

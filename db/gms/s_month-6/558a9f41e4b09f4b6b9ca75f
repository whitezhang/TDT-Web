He now lives in Sandyhills and has seven grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.His daughter told the Evening Times: &quot;Dad still tries to get along to games when he can but struggles a bit with the stairs now.&quot;He has passed his dedication for the club onto his grandchildren who also have season tickets.&quot;She added: &quot;My dad was absolutely delighted to be invited along to Ibrox to meet the legends and staff.&quot;He has followed Rangers for such a long time and it is so nice to see him being honoured.&quot;I can't thank everyone at the club enough.&quot;Former player Willie Henderson said: “John has so many fantastic memories and it has been great reminiscing with him.&quot;It is remarkable he can still come along to the games at Ibrox and I am delighted the club has recognised his loyalty with this gift today.”Fans group Rangers First have also recognised John’s loyal support and have made him their first honorary member.Rangers First Director, Ricki Neill said: “Rangers First are very proud to make Centenarian John Connelly our first honorary member.“John has been going to Ibrox for approximately 87 years and has had the opportunity to watch many legends like Dawson, Morton, Shaw, Baxter and Henderson right through to Cooper and Laudrup and is now honoured by the club he loves.“I was pleased to hear the new Rangers board helped to honour this achievement and yet again it shows the fans that we have the right men on the board now.&quot;All Rangers First members are proud to have John as a fellow member.”Mr Connelly celebrates his birthday on Sunday and his family have arranged a party for him on Saturday at the Fred Paton centre, near St George's Cross in Glasgow.The centre is run by the Glasgow Old People's Welfare Association which Mr Connelly is also an active member of.

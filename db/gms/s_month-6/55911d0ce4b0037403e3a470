Sunday sees The Moonkids perform an early gig at 5:30pm in Edinburgh's Wash Bar while there are a few other games like Musical Bingo on offer at Glasgow's King Tuts.
Next weekend hosts more of the same as Strathallan draws closer but this time round bands like Dead Man Fall, Spring Break and Hector Bizerk perform to put you into the spirit of things.
 

 
George Kyle of Tennent’s Lager said: “Moving to Strathallan Castle is an exciting new chapter for the festival, and so we wanted to get the party started a bit earlier than usual.
“If you’re a fan of the festival, make sure you don’t miss the next couple of weekends.”
T in the Park will take place at Strathallan Castle, Perthshire over 10th - 12th July.

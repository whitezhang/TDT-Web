NAPOLEON Bonaparte is alive and well – and enjoying retirement in a small Scottish town.
And he plans to mark today’s 200th anniversary of the French defeat at Waterloo by working on his garden.
The retired electrical engineer, of Torryburn, Fife, is the fourth member of his family to be called Napoleon.
He said: “I’ve never had any bother with my name. I took up judo at 13. Once they knew I was OK at it, I never got any bother.
 “But it can be a pain in the neck when you’re filling in a form. People think you’re having  them on. 
“It’s quite good when you go abroad, though,especially to Paris. They go, ‘Oh, beautiful name’. It’s good when you’re booking restaurants.
“I was in Majorca at a bank and they asked to see my passport. I was rushed to the front of the queue.”
The 68-year-old’s full name is Napoleon Bonaparte Sinclair Smith. He is known as Nap to family and friends.
Nap’s great-grandparents came from Quatre Bras in Lybster, Caithness, which was named after a battle in the Napoleonic wars.
 

The place name may have inspired George Sinclair’s decision to christen Nap’s grandfather the first Scottish Napoleon in 1886.
The name was carried down but it stops at father-of-two Nap.
He said: “I didn’t exactly decide against calling either of my children Napoleon. I think my wife Anne decided.”
Events to mark Waterloo’s anniversary have been going on this week. But Nap has no plans to do anything special.
He added: “We’re sorting the garden and putting down slabs, so we’ll be concentrating on that.”

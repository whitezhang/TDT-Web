Thanks for coming.&quot;You've got signs, you've got costumes - you went all out.&quot;Swift ended her two-hour show with Shake It Off, which she and her male suited dancers performed dancing on an elevated walkway which moved around the arena to the delight of fans, who got to their feet for the finale.She will play Manchester and London later this week.

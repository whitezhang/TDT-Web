A SCOTS holidaymaker badly injured after tumbling off a hotel balcony in Magaluf today reassured friends she was “alive and kicking”.
Jenna McAlpine, 21, posted a photograph of herself looking battered and bruised on her Facebook page this morning from a Spanish hospital bed.
She wrote: “So first few hours in Maga wasn’t a success.. Managed to topple over the balcony.
“Broke my arm and nose and fractured my hip. So lucky to be alive and I’ve still got all my teeth.
“Sorry to everyone I’ve gave a wee fright to. Just to let everyone know I’m alive and kicking. Well not kicking, I’ll be wheeling instead. Wheelchair for me.”
Pals quickly posted messages of sympathy after she put up the picture of her swollen face and her hand in a cast.
Kirstie Chalmers wrote: “Jeezo Jenna! Hope you’re ok! Might get that nose you’ve always hoped for free now...There’s your only bright side! Be careful! Xxxx”.
Lyndsey Martin posted: “Hope your okay Jenna.”
Shaunni Hamilton wrote: “Oh my Christ Jenna I feel sick!!! I’m so glad you’re okay!!”
Tyler Castledine wrote simply: “Legend.”

Tourists caught jumping from hotel balconies into swimming pools - a practice known locally as balconing - will be fined EUROS 1,500 (&pound;1,065) under the new regulations approved by local councillors last month.
Hotels usually take action against holidaymakers caught climbing between balconies.
A ban on night-time street drinking and changes to controversial pub crawls have also been introduced in Magaluf.
Hordes of British holidaymakers have been spotted over the past 48 hours flouting the new laws, which came into effect at midnight on Tuesday.

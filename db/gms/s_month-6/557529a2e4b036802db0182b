CAMPAIGNERS today called for men to be banned from paying prostitutes for sex in Glasgow.City councillors and staff at women's projects are calling for the purchase of sex to be criminalised as part of the End Prostitution Now campaign.The campaign, which is led by Glasgow City Council, the Women's Support Project (WSP) and the Glasgow Violence Against Women Partnership (GVAWP), backs Swedish-style criminalisation of punters.It will also call upon members of the public, MSPs, charities and public bodies, to put pressure on the Scottish Government to tackle the &quot;root cause&quot; of prostitution.Councillor James Coleman, chairman of the Glasgow Violence Against Women Partnership, said: &quot;The End Prostitution Now aims to engage with as many people as possible from all walks of life to make them aware of the horrific realities of prostitution and compel them to take action to help eradicate the serious harm it causes.&quot;Men's demand for sexual access to women's bodies is the ultimate cause of prostitution and all the misery it causes the world over.&quot;The End Prostitution Now strategy aims to secure legislation in Scotland which criminalises the buyers of sex, decriminalises those exploited by prostitution and provides support and services to help people involved to exit prostitution safely.Mr Coleman, lead spokesman for the campaign, added: &quot;We urge members of the public to put pressure on the Scottish Government to make this crucial legislative change by writing to their MSPs.&quot;End Prostitution Now is led by the WSP and partnered by Zero Tolerance, Encompass, Glasgow City Council's arms-length organisation Community Safety Glasgow, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Scottish Trade Union Congress.Liz Curran from the WSP, said: &quot;Prostitution is abuse, often extreme or violent in nature.&quot;Prostitution is never a matter of choice, nor is it a human right as some campaigners argue.&quot;No reasonable person wants the right to be sexually exploited, abused, demeaned, disadvantaged, socially-excluded and marginalised. &quot;Prostitution ruins lives, and it is far more serious and harmful an issue than many people may realise.&quot;The vast, but often silent, majority of women in prostitution are there through utter desperation, poverty and a lack of positive, alternative choices.&quot;The public needs to be aware of the realities which drive women into prostitution and towards such damaging survival behaviour.&quot;The launch of the campaign coincides with the announcement of amendments to the Human Trafficking and Exploitation Bill, which aligns with the aims of the End Prostitution Now campaign.Rhoda Grant MSP said: &quot;Prostitution is a form of exploitation which only causes harm, and I wholeheartedly support the End Prostitution Now campaign and its aims.&quot;I believe that the Scottish Government can and should introduce appropriate legislation to ban the purchase of sex.&quot;The longer we delay passing this legalisation, the more vulnerable individuals will be exploited in this way.&quot;

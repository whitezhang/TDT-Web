FARAH ALI is one of an army of helpers across the country who keeps her community alive.The work of the mother of three from Newlands in the south side of Glasgow at the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice is celebrated in Volunteers' Week.She has given a hand in the cafe at the Carlton Place hospice once a week for the past six years after her daughter Rumila, not a trained nurse, got involved.&quot;I'm very happy and feel peaceful after working in the hospice. The staff are very kind and create a loving, supportive environment for their patients and families. Everyone is guaranteed a warm welcome,&quot; she said.Now Farah appears in the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice Foundation Appeal Campaign, backed by the Evening Times, for their brand new build at Bellahouston Park.The hospice has a team of 575 volunteers who help out on a day-to-day basis and keep the organisation ticking over.Whether volunteering in the caf&Atilde;&copy;, helping out at one of the hospice's 16 shops, carrying out leaflet and poster drops, organising fundraising events or bucket collections, or working with family services, bereavement counselling, volunteers all feed back that they love volunteering and that they feel part of a team, have a sense of belonging and purpose and get lots more back in feel good factor than they feel that they give.&quot;We could not run without our fantastic volunteers and the truth is we are always recruiting. We would love lots of volunteers to come forward for our busy retail outlets,&quot; said Catriona MacLeod, volunteer service co-ordinator.If you are interested in volunteering for the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice, call 0141 429 5599.

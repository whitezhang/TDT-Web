A COMMUNITY garden in Shettleston is helping to feed the locals.Last year's Streets Ahead winners the Smelly Welly Club was visited by Social Justice Secretary Alex Neil who was talking about his fears that children could be affected by Westminster's &pound;12 billion welfare cuts.The club encourages children to learn about healthy eating and community growing and received funding from the People and Communities Fund and Scottish Government supported STV Children's Appeal in 2014.Mr Neil's visit came ahead of the Cabinet Secretary's key note speech at the Child Poverty Action Group conference where he encouraged organisations to work together to fight the UK Government's &pound;12 billion austerity cuts.Mr Neil said: &quot;The UK Government's proposed &pound;12 billion cuts will have a detrimental impact on Scotland and will do nothing to tackle the scourge of child poverty.&quot;John Dickie the Director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland said: &quot;With key areas of social security set to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament today's Child Poverty Action Group conference is bringing together over 180 frontline advisers to get the latest details on what exactly is being proposed and share ideas on how new powers might be used to improve benefit support and tackle poverty more effectively.&quot;The discussion is crucial coming as it does against a backdrop of rising child poverty and the threat of further cuts to the UK benefits that families both in and out of work rely on.&quot;

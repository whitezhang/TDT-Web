A 40FT hedge that sparked a 20-year feud between neighbours is finally to be cut down to size.
Residents were fed-up with the huge leylandii in Catriona MacGregor’s garden blocking out light to their home.
 They took action under a law brought in last year to tackle “hedge rage” disputes. And  now Scottish Government officials have ordered her to cut back what they described as an “overbearing forest”. 
 

MacGregor planted the hedge at her home in the Stirlingshire village of Buchlyvie in 1983.
It was initially trimmed to 8ft and the row began when she stopped cutting it 20 years ago.
 

One villager said: “Everyone has been up in arms but until the new Act came in, there was nothing we could do about it.
“We lose three or four hours light a day. We hope this has come to an end but I’ll believe it when I see it.”
 

Stirling Council issued 10 notices under the High Hedges Act ordering that MacGregor should cut it back.
She refused, claiming it provided privacy and was a vital nesting area for birds.
MacGregor, who could not be contacted for comment, has until October to comply or Stirling Council will cut the hedge back and bill her.

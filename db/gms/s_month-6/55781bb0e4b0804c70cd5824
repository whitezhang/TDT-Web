A swan has been driven to safety in a police car after being rescued by two officers.
Constables Lisa Ritchie and Ryan Campbell caught the bird after it was spotted on the road at Tongland, Kirkcudbright.
It appeared the swan had become lost and they feared it was in danger of being hit by a passing car.
It was taken to Castle Douglas police office in Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish SPCA was contacted.
The animal welfare charity collected the swan and was able to return it to the water, where it was reunited with its cygnets.
In February, fire fighters and SSPCA officers rescued a swan after it became tangled in telephone cables. 
Constable Campbell said: &quot;It looks like the swan had flown off from the cygnets to get food and thereafter became disorientated.
&quot;It was a bit daunting to try and capture the swan. However, it didn't seem to mind the ride in the police car.&quot;
We revealed how a pigeon was airlifted from a North Sea oil platform by helicopter after crashing onto the rig.

Equipment for detecting volcanic ash is to be installed at three sites in Scotland.
The Met Office proposes installing light detection and ranging systems (LiDARs) at sites in Stornoway on Lewis, Lerwick on Shetland and Glasgow.
They will be among 10 locations across the UK where the equipment will be used to help better forecast the impact of volanic eruptions on air travel.
Flights were cancelled in 2010 and 2011 following volcanic activity in Iceland.
There were concerns grains of volcanic ash thrown into the atmosphere by the Eyjafjallajokull and Grimsvotn could harm aircraft engines.

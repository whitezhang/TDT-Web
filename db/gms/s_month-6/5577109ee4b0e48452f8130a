A new SNP MP has been ticked off for reading a newspaper in the Commons chamber.John Nicolson was gently rebuked by the Speaker after he spotted the East Dunbartonshire MP perusing the paper during Defence Questions.&quot;Can I just very gently point out,&quot; said John Bercow, &quot;we are not in the reading room of the Bearsden public library and an MP shouldn't read a newspaper unless it relates to the matter currently under consideration by the House.&quot;He added: &quot;I say that in a jocular spirit to the Honourable Gentleman.&quot;The greatly expanded group of SNP MPs ran into trouble on the first day in Parliament after applauding remarks by their Westminster leader Angus Robertson as he outlined the party's response to the Queen's Speech. There has also been a row over where SNP MPs can sit in the chamber.Several of the Nationalist Members have urged their Commons colleagues to be patient as they learn the rules of the House.In his maiden speech, Edinburgh East MP Tommy Sheppard pointed out: &quot;It will take us time to learn the processes that work here, it will take us time to get our feet under the table and it will take you time to get used to us. But I hope we will be able to do that in the weeks and months ahead.&quot;

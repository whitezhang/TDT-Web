The fire service is calling on friends and relatives of vulnerable people to highlight those most at risk from fires at home after the 28th death this year.The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said that older people, those with physical or mental health issues and those with drug and alcohol issues are all at increased risk of experiencing a fire in their homes and being injured or dying as a result.They are urging friends, relatives and neighbours to put them in touch with those most at risk so that they can discuss fire safety with them.The 28th death this year came after a man firefighters rescued from a blaze at a flat in Barrhead, East Renfrewshire, on Thursday May 28 later died of his injuries.Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay, SFRS director of prevention and protection, said: &quot;To lose someone through fire is utterly devastating and it always leaves a lasting impact on the families, friends and communities touched by the tragedy.&quot;The sad reality is many fatal fires could be prevented. We know very simple steps are often the difference between life and death.&quot;Every one of us can make that difference just by talking to people we know who might be vulnerable and putting them in touch with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.&quot;Fire threatens every home - we all need to understand it can happen to us and the people around us, consider the risks and live up to our responsibility to do what we can to save lives.&quot;Firefighters throughout Scotland actively work to help individual householders stay safe but said that many of those most at risk can be reluctant to contact SFRS for support.They offer free home safety visits conducted by local crews at times convenient for the householder, during which firefighters also provide and install free smoke alarms where needed.Mr Ramsay said: &quot;Our crews always do everything they can but unfortunately their courage and professionalism in responding to a fire won't always be enough.&quot;Even where a fire has remained small, the smoke and heat produced can very quickly spread through a home and threaten the life of anyone inside.&quot;We would much rather take the time to do a free home fire safety visit and help someone prevent a fire than respond to a blaze where they may have already suffered life-changing, or even life-ending, injuries.&quot;Free home fire safety visits are available from SFRS by calling the freephone number 0800 073 1999, by texting 'FIRE' to 80800 or by filling in an online form at www.firescotland.gov.uk.

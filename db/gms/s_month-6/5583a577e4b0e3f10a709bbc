LEADING Scottish writer and artist Alasdair Gray has suffered serious injuries after a fall at his home.
It is believed the 80-year-old suffered injuries to his back as well as to his legs and head, although they were described as “non life-threatening”
Mr Gray is best known for his novel Lanark. But he is also known for his artworks, including a series of murals. The most famous of them spans the ceiling of the Oran Mor pub and restaurant complex in the West End of Glasgow.
The incident occurred at 1:50am outside his house yesterday. It is understood he fell into the basement outside his home and was found by a neighbour. 
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed they were called to an incident with an 80-year-old man at Marchmont Terrace in the West End of Glasgow. She said: “An ambulance attended and he was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary for treatment. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening and inquiries are continuing.”
His son Andrew, who lives in the US, has been informed and is flying to Scotland. Gray’s wife, Morag McAlpine, passed away last year. His friend and gallerist Joe Mulholland said: “I have heard he had the fall at 2am.”
The novel Lanark, written by Gray over 30 years, is now regarded as a classic. It was described as “one of the landmarks of 20th-century fiction”. His novel Poor Things, published in 1992, won the Whitbread Novel Award and the Guardian Fiction Price. He describes himself as a civic nationalist and a republican. 
Gray’s works combine elements of realism, fantasy and science fiction. He has also written on politics in support of socialism and Scottish independence.

The man who murdered Glasgow gangland figure Kevin &quot;Gerbil&quot; Carroll is to appeal against his conviction.
William Paterson, 35, was jailed for life and told to serve a minimum of 22 years for shooting the 29-year-old dead in an Asda car park in Glasgow in 2010.
He claimed he was elsewhere at the time and incriminated six other people.
Paterson was convicted following a two-week trial at the High Court in Glasgow. His lawyer has now lodged a notice of intention to appeal.

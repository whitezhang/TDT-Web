A SCOTS tourist has died after an apparent fall from a hotel balcony in the Ibizan party resort of San Antonio.
Police and paramedics were alerted after the 26-year-old man was found around 11.30pm on Saturday.
Attempts to revive him proved fruitless and he was pronounced dead at the scene.
He was named as Robert Gillespie, who was staying at a fifth-floor room in the two-star Piscis Park Hotel.
A British holidaymaker was filmed last summer jumping from the roof of the same hotel into the swimming pool as part of a dare.
An investigation was under way last night to determine the cause of death, although sources said they believed he had fallen from a balcony at the hotel, which overlooks San Antonio bay.
Robert - known as Fraser - was from Larbert.

The tragedy follows another death involving a British holidaymaker in San Antonio this year.
On May 15, a Brit tourist died after falling down stairs inside a bar in Magaluf, on neighbouring island Majorca.
Ian Frankland, 36, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, plunged nearly 20ft down a flight of stairs inside Mulligan’s on the resort’s brash Punta Ballena strip.
On May 2, a British man died in the same Majorcan resort after plunging from a 13th floor balcony.
Police were unable to comment on reports the dead man was found lying in the hotel car park,but confirmed an investigation was under way. His body was removed by undertakers just before 1.30am yesterday.
After last year’s roof-top jump into the Piscis Park Hotel’s pool a British tourist posted a video on Facebook of the stunt - a practice known locally as ‘balconing’, which the local authorities are trying to stamp out with fines.
The man named on Facebook as the jumper bragged afterwards: ‘Stop worrying, it’s done now.' But another Facebook user criticised him as ‘an idiot’.

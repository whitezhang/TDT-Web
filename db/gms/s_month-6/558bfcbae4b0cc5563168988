 THE Prince of Wales has signed a ukulele for auction on a visit to the Glasgow pub where a helicopter crash claimed 10 lives. 
 Charles was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall on a visit to the Clutha bar , where a police helicopter plunged through the roof on November 29 2013. 
Charles and Camilla signed a special instrument that will be auctioned to raise funds for the Clutha Trust, a charity working to support young people in the aftermath of the crash, and the Prince's Trust.
 The Prince visited the site days after the tragedy to speak to survivors and emergency workers and signed the city's book of condolence. 
 

On a return visit with Camilla today, he was greeted by owner Alan Crossan and stopped to admire the mural of well-known faces painted on the outside of the bar, including one of comic Spike Milligan who the Prince admired.
 The royal couple, known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland, passed through the Clutha to the bar's garden area where they met representatives from the Clutha Trust, the Prince's Trust, the Gorbals Barn Project and Royston Youth Action. 
Charles signed and dated the ukelele before enjoying a drink in the adjoining Victoria bar and listening to a performance by musicians from the Prince's Trust.
The Clutha has been shut since the night of the tragedy, with building work ongoing to refurbish the property.

GIRAFFE is coming to Glasgow.The popular restaurant chain is due to open at its West Regent Street&nbsp;location next month, close&nbsp;to the old Odeon which shut down in 2006.It will occupy a ground floor location of 1 West Regent Street, a multi-million pound office block development which opened this year.This will be the second Giraffe restaurant in Glasgow, with the other found in the Silverburn Tesco Extra, marked by a 10ft tall giraffe.Everything from breakfast to desserts will be served in an environment which focuses on being friendly.The chain, bought by Tesco in 2013, is named to symbolise the &quot;different view of the world&quot; giraffes have.Russel Joffe, one of Giraffe's founding&nbsp;members, said: &quot;1 West Regent Street was a clear choice for us given its very close proximity to Buchanan Street and the transport hubs.&quot;We're very excited that we've managed to secure such a fantastic and high profile corner unit and can't wait to get started on our fit out plans.&quot;

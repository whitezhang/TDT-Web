 GRUFFALO author Julia Donaldson has hit out at neurotic parents who refuse to let their children walk to school alone - and says that the threat of paedophiles is exaggerated. 
The 66-year-old novelist, who brought her children up in Bearsden, has revealed that she let her son travel by train on his own into Glasgow city centre when he was ten.
The award-winning children's author said it was good for children to get a taste of freedom and urged parents to allow them to make their own way to school.
 Julia said: &quot;One of my sons was ten and we lived in Bearsden outside Glasgow and every Thursday he would get the train into town and go to Games Workshop and he would get the train back,&quot; reports The Times. 
&quot;The risk of children being accosted by paedophiles was also not as perceived by many parents,&quot; she continued.
&quot;I don't think the number of paedophiles has increased, I'm sure it is completely the same.&quot;
&quot;There is so much in the press about it that people are totally neurotic about that and I think that it is a bit exaggerated.&quot;
In 2011, Donaldson received an MBE for services to literature after her book The Gruffalo, which tells the story of a mouse who took a walk in the woods, was published and went on to sell more than 13 million copies.

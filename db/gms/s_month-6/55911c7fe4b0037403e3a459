PARTICIPANTS were showered with powder of various shades as they ran, walked and jogged along the 5K route at Glasgow Green.
A final explosion of colour greeted them as they crossed the finishing line. The Color Me Rad event is based on the Hindu festival of colours, also known as Holi.
Morning downpours meant conditions for running at Glasgow Green were far from ideal.
 

But the organisers refused to be put off.
They said: “No rain can bring down this parade – it just makes the colour even brighter.”
Color Me Rad runs have been held across the UK this summer, including one in Edinburgh in May.

CASH seized from criminals should be spent in communities with high deprivation according to a city MSP.Police have taken more than &pound;75m from crooks and gangsters since the Proceeds of Crime legislation allowed it in 2007.Bob Doris, SNP MSP for Glasgow, wants to see more of the money going to areas in Glasgow with health inequalities.He said that the communities which have a crime problem are also often ones with greater health inequalities and higher deprivation.Mr Doris asked the Justice Secretary, Michael Matheson, if he would focus more of the cash in these areas for projects to improve health and access to sport facilities.The MSP said communities in the north of Glasgow like Possilpark, Springburn and Royston could benefit from a greater allocation of cash seized from the criminals who ply their trade in these areas.Mr Matheson said there is a focus on deprivation but he would consider the request when cash was next due to be allocated.He said: &quot;All cashback projects are required under the terms of their grants to focus activity in deprived communities identified in the Scottish index of multiple deprivation.&quot;He added: &quot;I assure him that that will be part of our thinking on how we can improve the operation of the cashback programme.Current funding for projects under Cashback for Communities runs until March 2017 and decisions on the next round will be taken before then.Mr Doris said &quot;I firmly believe more money should be prioritized in those communities and I will pursue this with the Scottish Government in the run up to the 2017 fund.&quot;Poor life outcomes and deprivation often drive people to crime - it is only right that cash taken from crooks is used to improve the health and life outcomes in such communities.&quot;

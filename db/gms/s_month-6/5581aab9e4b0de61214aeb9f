CAN’T wait for T in the Park – then why not enjoy T in the Pub?
Scotland’s largest festival sponsors Tennent’s have organised a series of “warm-up” events ahead of the first ever T in the Park to take place at Strathallan Castle.
They are promising pub-goers performances from T Break acts, pop-up appearances from festival bands, musical bingo and ticket-hunts in the coming weeks.
“Tennent’s has been at the heart of T in the Park since it began 22 years ago,” said George Kyle of Tennent’s Lager. 
“Moving to Strathallan Castle is an exciting new chapter for the festival, and so we wanted to get the party started a bit earlier than usual.
“If you’re a fan of the festival, make sure you don’t miss the next couple of weekends.”
 

Partner bars taking part include Glasgow’s Campus and King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut, Edinburgh’s Three Sisters and Wash Bar.
Aberdeen's Bridge Street Social, Dundee Clarks and Perth’s The Green Room are also signed up.

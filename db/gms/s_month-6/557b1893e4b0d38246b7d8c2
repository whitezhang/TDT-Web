A MAN who knocked down and killed an 11-year-old has dodged having his sentence extended after admitting trying to pawn a stolen guitar.Christopher Hannah, 33, is serving 12 years and three months for the culpable homicide of Sophie Brannan, who he killed last November when he ploughed a car into her while high on drugs.Yesterday (Fri) at Glasgow Sheriff Court he was handed a 245 day sentence after admitting resetting two guitars and a leap book, electronic game in March last year.But the sentence imposed by sheriff Alayne Swanson will be served concurrently with the jail time he is serving just now, meaning he will not spend any extra time behind bars.The court heard Gary Roger had goods from his Dennistoun flat stolen on December 22, 2013 by Matthew Gavin.Months later in March 2014, Gavin returned to the flat - armed with a crow bar and two other males - assaulted Mr Roger and his partner and stole more items from his house.He pled guilty to stealing from the flat on Alexandra Park Street on December 22, 2013.The 28-year-old from Haghill, Glasgow, also admitted forcing his way into the property on March 22, 2014, with his face masked, assaulting Mr Roger and his partner, making threats and stealing items including three guitars.He will be sentenced next month for his crimes.Procurator fiscal depute John Bedford told the court that after the incident on March 22, Mr Roger didn't want to phone the police.During the raid on his home Gavin told Mr Roger: &quot;If you phone the f****** polis I'll come back for you.&quot;Mr Bedford said: &quot;Due to threats made to him the witness Roger did not initially contact the police as he was fearful that the males would return and harm him.&quot;On March 24, 2014 Mr Roger still did not want to involve the police due to still being fearful of the consequences of doing so.&quot;However, he still wanted to try to get his property back so he began to call around pawn shops and cash converters shops in the east end and city centre to provide a description of guitars should anyone try to sell them on.&quot;The court was told around 4pm the same day Hannah went to cash converters on Union Street, Glasgow and attempted to pawn a Gretsch guitar.The manager recognised the guitar as the one described and contacted the police.When officers arrived they took Hannah's details and he went with them to Stewart Street police office.He was later interviewed and admitted he was trying to pawn the instrument knowing it had been stolen.During a search of his flat police found a Crafter guitar and child's leap pad from a bedroom.On November 14, last year Hannah was driving a hired Vauxhall Astra in the Maryhill area and lost control.He then fully mounted the pavement before hitting the gable end of a nearby building.However, the car continued to career forward eventually ploughing into Sophie and the two people with her from behind.She was rushed to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill where she was found to have swelling to her brain, several fractures and broken bones.The schoolgirl remained in intensive care overnight, but she tragically never recovered and was pronounced dead on the morning on November 15.

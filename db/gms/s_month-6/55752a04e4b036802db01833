THOUSANDS of people lined the streets of the West End as a Mardi Gras extravaganza took over the city.Around 80,000 people were believed to have joined the party yesterday at the famous West End Festival parade through Byres Road and the surrounding area.This year's Festival Sunday featured almost 40 spectacular acts, including face painters, a pipe band, dancers and fire performers.Festival goers came from across the UK to take part in the event, which was centred on the theme of 'bloom', and soak up the incredible atmosphere.Mum-of-two, Sarah McIntyre, 31, said: &quot;It was a great day - I loved it.&quot;I make a point of coming every year with my family because we have been doing it since I was a kid.&quot;I love that now I can bring my kids and hopefully they will love it as much as I do.&quot;Both adults and youngsters were kept entertained with the amount of activities on offer, including the extension of local bars and cafes, food and craft stalls and an array of eye catching costumes such as a giant thistle and even Disney princesses Anna and Elsa from the film, Frozen.Fire performer, Catch it Col, performed at the festival for the first time yesterday and said he would &quot;love&quot; to return to its atmosphere.The 28-year-old from Edinburgh said: &quot;It is absolutely great, a great atmosphere.&quot;It is a good, fun day out for the family, there are so many incredible acts they have catered for everyone.&quot;There have been lots of crowds and lots of donations - it has been brilliant.&quot;The festival began on Friday and will continue until June 28, with acts coming from travelling hundreds of miles for a chance to join the line up.Jenny King, a member of The Harry Ensemble, came from Wiltshire for her chance to perform as part of the festival on Saturday in the Rennie Mackintosh church.The 63-year-old said: &quot;The concert was fantastic, it was an excellent way to end the season and we just had to come along and see the parade.&quot;We loved it - we loved the variety of acts and the fact that we have seen bagpipes being played.&quot;Liz Scobie, chairman of the festival, said: &quot;Already we've had huge support for our 20th West End Festival.&quot;The Gibson Street Gala, a world premiere, local markets and stalls and now the famous parade, all within a week.&quot;

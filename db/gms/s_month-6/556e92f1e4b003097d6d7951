A SET of community inspired stained glass windows were unveiled celebrating an area's cultural heritage.More than 40 residents of all ages from Govanhill took part in the nine month project, creating designs which reflected themes important to them.The topics pictured on the five windows include that of Irish immigration in Glasgow, and a panel with inspirational phrases aimed at encouraging youngsters as they become adults.The windows will be going on permanent public display at the library, as the outcome of a partnership between residents, Glasgow Life and the Govanhill Youth Project.Councillor Archie Graham, the chairman of Glasgow Life, said: &quot;Govanhill Library sits at the very heart of this diverse community, and I'm delighted that local residents of all ages have come together to portray how they feel about the area in such a striking, positive way.&quot;Not only do the Diversity Windows showcase the rich cultural diversity of Govanhill, increasing a sense of identity for residents, it has also enabled participants to gain new skills, broadening their horizons and, in turn, opening up new pathways towards learning and employment.&quot;A wide variety of community groups were involved, such as the Asian Women's Group, the Irish Heritage Foundation, the Govanhill Youth Project, the AGAP Art Group and pupils from Hollybrook Academy.Local stained glass artist Keira McLean helped each group to create the final piece.She said: &quot;Govanhill Library is a central hub for all members of the community; a place to share stories and learn about the heritage of different cultures, and as such, is the perfect home for the Diversity Windows.&quot;I would like to thank all involved with the project for all of the hard work and dedication they put in to the creation of the window. Without the local groups, none of this would be possible.&quot;The required funding was received by the Govanhill Youth Group through the Celebrate programme, which is a National Lottery grant on the back of the Commonwealth Games.The group's unique contribution was a graffiti wall made of glass, with each brick designed to reflect the personalities of its members.AGAP Art Group created a 'Memories of Glasgow' window, taking inspiration from Glasgow sunsets and Dixon's Blazes.The story of Irish immigration was told by the Irish Heritage Foundation, with another window celebrating 'Cultural Fusion' and the place of women and girls at the heart of Govanhill's Asian community.Fourth year pupils at Hollybrook Academy used colour to express feelings and emotions, and included inspirational quotes supporting their journey to adulthood.The innovative project reflects the move by Glasgow Libraries to broaden their services beyond those traditionally expected.Govanhill Library recorded a total of 106,640 visits in 2014/15.

The DEPORTATION of a Glasgow musician has been raised at Westminster.Steve Forman's case was brought up at Prime Minister's Questions yesterday by SNP MP Patrick Grady.Mr Forman, who works at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in the city centre, played with David Bowie and Pink Floyd during his career as a session drummer but has been denied a work visa.A US citizen, the 68-year-old has lived in the UK since 2007 but under the UK rules his current salary is considered too low to allow him to remain in the country.As a lecturer his job falls short of the government's &pound;31,000 requirement for foreign nationals however once his musical royalties are taken into consideration he is understood to make far more than that.During this week's Prime Minster's Questions Glasgow North MP Patrick Grady said: &quot;The Prime Minister might be aware of the ongoing case of my constituent Dr Steve Forman, who, despite his immense contribution to the music and creative scene in Glasgow, Scotland and around the world, the Home Office is seeing fit to try to deport back to the United States.&quot;He then asked David Cameron directly why &quot;people such as Dr Forman do not seem to be welcome in this country?&quot; during the afternoon session.Mr Grady also jokingly added: &quot;If the Prime Minister cannot run an immigration policy that works for Scotland, I know a Government up the road that would be very happy to take on the job.&quot;During the afternoon session Mr Cameron admitted he was not aware of the case but said he would &quot;look at it after PMQs and see what I can do.&quot;As previously reported in the Evening Times, thousands of people signed a petition calling for the &quot;internationally renowned and respected artist&quot; to have his visa reinstated.Almost 4000 supporters signed the online campaign last year, and more than 60 letters of support were written ahead of an immigration hearing.The petition stated: &quot;We, the signatories to this petition, believe that the Home Office should immediately reinstate his work Visa in order that he may continue to share his vast knowledge and experience in Scotland.&quot;After the Home Office bid to remove him was thrown out in court, immigration officials appealed the decision.Former Glasgow MP Ann McKechin called for support from the Scotland Office to stop the musician from being extradited, writing to Alistair Carmichael appealing for help in January this year.hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

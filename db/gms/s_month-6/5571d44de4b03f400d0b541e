The Order added it is paying for everything.The petition, which has more than 25,000 signatures, said: &quot;The people of Glasgow and Scotland are sick of their voices going unheard in relation to sectarian, hate-filled orange marches. We demand that GCC answer to the people of Glasgow as to why this was allowed to go ahead in a city-centre location on a busy Saturday.&quot;The Orange Order said last night that the event was an &quot;open invitation to gain a better understanding of one of Glasgow's oldest and biggest fraternal and charitable organisations, warts and all&quot;.A statement read: &quot;The usual suspects have made a last-minute attempt at discrediting the event, deriding it as 'provocative' and 'divisive', and calling upon the city council to ban it.&quot;Recent government-funded studies on sectarianism advocated greater public engagement in order to tackle myths, misconceptions and improve community relationships. Saturday's event is an honest contribution towards that end.&quot;

THE number of people with diabetes in Scotland has reached an all-time high.New figures, released for Diabetes Week, show that there were 276,430 people registered with diabetes in 2014, including over 17,200 people newly diagnosed.This is an increase of more than 8,200 compared to the previous year - the equivalent to the population of Peebles.Around 10% (29,802) are living with Type 1 diabetes while 88% (244,050) have Type 2 diabetes.Additionally, an estimated 45,500 people in Scotland are living with undiagnosed Type 2.The latest figures show there are 61,869 people on the diabetes register in Greater Glasgow. In 2014 there were 193 new cases of Type 1 diabetes and 3,807 new cases of Type 2 diabetes.Jane-Claire Judson, National Director of Diabetes Scotland, said: &quot;Since 2008 there has been a 25% increase in the number of people living with diabetes in Scotland.&quot;While this trend itself is of great concern, a major issue facing people living with diabetes is the lack of provision and access to good diabetes education.&quot;We acknowledge there have been improvements in patient education in recent years and the issue was highlighted in the Scottish Government's recent Diabetes Improvement Plan 2014.&quot;However, more needs to be done to ensure that every person diagnosed with diabetes is given the opportunity for structured education to help them learn how to manage the condition well.&quot;

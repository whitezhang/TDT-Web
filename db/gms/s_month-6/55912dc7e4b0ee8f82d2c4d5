Mini heatwave sparks health alertA heatwave is set to hit the UK, sending temperatures soaring into the 30s and triggering a health alert.The Met Office said there was an &quot;80% probability&quot; of heatwave conditions between noon tomorrow and 6am on Thursday in parts of England.The forecast triggered a 'Level 2' alert with the Met Office warning: &quot;Heatwaves can be dangerous, especially for the very young or very old or those with chronic disease.&quot;A spokesman said: &quot;Temperatures are expected to build on Tuesday and into Wednesday, with the hottest day of the year so far expected on successive days this working week.&quot;Wednesday is likely to be the hottest day of the year so far, with temperatures soaring to 33C (91F).A Met Office spokesman said temperatures will drop again on Thursday when severe thunderstorms are likely to hit central and western parts of the country, before climbing again ahead of the weekend.The heatwave is caused by a warm front and tropical continental air mass from Europe pushing across the country - bringing with it high temperatures and humidity.Coastal areas will be cooler, but Northern Ireland and Scotland will still experience temperatures in the mid to high 20s.The highest temperature so far this year was recorded at Gravesend - where the mercury rose to 27.8C (82F).A Met Office spokesman said: &quot;There is a plume of heat that is going to push towards the UK from Tuesday and beyond.&quot;Temperatures are expected to reach 29C (84F) in London and 27C (80F) in Wales and the Midlands, before climbing to above 30C (80F) tomorrow.Dr Jill Meara, of Public Health England's Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, said: &quot;It looks like there's a chance for some hot weather in some places so we're advising people to take some time to look at the Heatwave Plan for England and the accompanying advice on NHS Choices.&quot;The key here is to think how heat, if it comes, may affect you, your family and those around you. So think about protecting children from the sun, about looking in on an elderly neighbour or relative, and most important of all keep an eye on the weather forecast.&quot;Temperatures will be similar to those in Rome and Florida, and higher than in Rio de Janeiro and Bucharest.

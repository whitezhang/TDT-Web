A GLASGOW punter is in celebra-TORY mood after picking up a cheque for &pound;240,000 for backing the Conservatives to win an overall majority at Westminster.
The unnamed pensioner shocked Ladbrokes staff in April by staking &pound;30,000 on an outright Tory win - a move that contradicted predictions from every poll and political commentator.
Ladbrokes offered odds of 7/1 for the bet - and were left counting the cost.
A spokesman for Ladbrokes said: “I can confirm that the gentleman has been paid in full and has specifically asked not to be identified.
“Once again we congratulate him on his record-breaking election win.”

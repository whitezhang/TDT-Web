NICOLA Sturgeon lived up to her billing as a “comedian” on an American chat show.
In a series of brisk exchanges with comic Jon Stewart on the Daily Show, the First Minister fended off the threat of America invading Scotland for its oil.
And she sailed through the interview even after she was compared to Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
Sturgeon joked that she had “ordered an inquiry” into why the SNP won only 56 of Scotland’s 59 parliamentary seats.
Stewart replied: “You think you’re Saddam Hussein? You get 99 per cent?”
“I think you should always aim for more,” she fired back.
The late night interview on Comedy Central came during Sturgeon’s four-day trip to New York and Washington.
Stewart’s staff accidentally described Sturgeon as “a comedian” in the show’s billing. But she took that in her stride with a charming appearance that will no doubt have endeared her to many Americans.
She said: “You raised all these expectations that I’d be funny but I’m a politician. And as you know, politicians are rarely very funny.”
Stewart replied: “You need not worry – they thought I was going to be funny for 17 years.”
Stewart asked the First Minister about haggis before Sturgeon said that Scotland could achieve economic independence based partly on its oil supplies.
Stewart asked: “May we invade you?”

She replied: “You don’t usually ask permission.”
A Scottish Government spokesman said: “The First Minister is in the US where she is undertaking a series of business and government meetings that will promote Scotland as an attractive place to live, visit, study and invest.
“The Daily Show is an ideal opportunity to do exactly that and reach out to more Americans.”

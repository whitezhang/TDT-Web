A few people were upset but mainly people were just walking around in shock.&quot;Then we went back to our hotel room and we could see from the balcony the armed police and police helicopters on the beach.&quot;We stayed in our room for about an hour and then went down to reception to get information, but there's not really any available.&quot;It is such a shame as this is a beautiful country and we have been having such a great holiday.&quot;Gourock couple William and Carol Kane were on a wedding anniversary celebration trip when they caught up in the terror attack.They are now waiting for a flight home.Carol told website Inverclyde Now: &quot;We were going to sunbathe but because we got sunburned we decided to go shopping, then there was chaos. We heard crackling noises and explosions. All of a sudden all these people were telling us to run.&quot;We had to run into any hotel away from beach and had to stay there as our hotel was next door to the one that was targeted. It was like something out a film, really scary.&quot;While we were in the hotel a boy came in covered in blood. It wasn't his blood -- he said his mum and dad got shot beside him and he couldn't find them.&quot;Carol said they were waiting in a hotel until they could go to the airport. &quot;Nobody dares go outside, it's a horrible feeling here,&quot; she added.Major Scottish travel firm Barrhead Travel has offered Scots caught up in the Tunisia shooting a chance to fly home early.The company set up a team to contact Scottish holidaymakers offering them a chance to fly home early as the horrific events unfolded yesterday.The organisation are also offering help to travellers making their way to the country on one of the three flights flying from Glasgow Airport on Sunday.A Barrhead Travel spokeswoman said: “We are offering our customers a chance to rearrange their entire holiday.“If they longer want to fly out to Tunisia we are giving them the chance to chance their preferred destination with no fee amendment.”However, other imminent travellers were not so lucky.Bernie Glover, 47, from Carfin, is due to fly out to Tunisia on Sunday after booking with First Choice, however, the company are not allowing her to amend her destination without paying a fee.She said: “I was told that due to my departure only being two days away I wouldn’t get anything back for my holiday.“I don’t feel safe going there as our hotel is only 45 minutes away from where the attack happened“I am absolutely furious First Choice are not doing anything to help.“I am going to go into the shop and demand they do something.“I would even pay a fee to change my holiday rather than lose nearly &pound;4000.”When the Evening Times contacted, First Choice they said they are aware of reports of a terrorist incident in Tunisia.An emailed statement read: &quot;We would like to offer our deepest sympathies to the friends and families of those involved.&quot;We are working closely with our teams in Tunisia and the relevant authorities to determine exactly what has happened and provide assistance to those affected.&quot;Thomas Cook, Thomson and Jet 2 all have flights going to Tunisia on Sunday from Glasgow and are doing all they can to assist worried customers.A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: “We can confirm that the reported hotels are not offered by Thomas Cook, and that none of our customers or staff were in residence at the time of the incident.“However, we do currently have customers staying in other parts of the resort, and our experienced teams on the ground are continuing to offer every support to them and their families at this difficult time.“Thomas Cook would like to extend its most sincere condolences to the family and friends of those affected.“Our customers’ welfare remains our primary concern, and we are continuing to liaise closely with our overseas team and the FCO.“In light of today’s events, Thomas Cook is offering customers the opportunity to amend their bookings to Tunisia free of charge for holidays departing up to and including 24 July 2015.”Jet 2 said they done everything they could to assist customers with their in-resort team assessing the situation.

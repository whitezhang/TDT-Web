A TWO-MINUTE silence has been held outside a police station for Sheku Bayoh who died in custody last month.
Hundreds of people turned out in Kirkcaldy, Fife, to support the family of the 31-year-old gas engineer whose death is being investigated by the police watchdog.
They took part in a funeral procession from the town's Hayfield Road, where police were called to an incident involving Mr Bayoh on May 3 and where dozens of floral tributes have now been laid.
Members of the community joined the father-of-two's relatives and friends on a walk to Kirkcaldy police station on St Brycedale Avenue where he was remembered during a two-minute silence.
A hearse with a floral wreath reading &quot;Daddy&quot; led the procession.
The crowd, many of them wearing T-shirts with a picture of Mr Bayoh, chanted &quot;we want answers&quot; and &quot;we want justice&quot; before heading to the Kirkcaldy Islamic Centre for prayers.
The family's lawyer Aamer Anwar told those gathered: &quot;The family have never asked for anything unreasonable, they have simply asked for answers of what happened.
&quot;They have tried desperately to keep an open mind and they still try to do so.&quot;

Mr Bayoh, originally from Sierra Leone, had lived in Fife for more than 10 years. He will be laid to rest later at Dysart Muslim Cemetery.
An investigation into his death is being undertaken by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC).
The Scottish Police Federation (SPF) said officers had been responding to a call of a man brandishing a knife.
Mr Bayoh's family have questioned why no officer has been suspended while the inquiry takes place and Mr Anwar has criticised the SPF, saying that the officers should have spoken to PIRC immediately after the death.
PIRC said it had made &quot;several attempts&quot; to secure statements from the officers, who have now agreed to provide them.

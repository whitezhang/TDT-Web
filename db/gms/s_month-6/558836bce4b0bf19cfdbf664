 ADMINISTRATORS have said 129 jobs will go with the closure of the Arches in Glasgow. 
Management at the renowned entertainment venue called in receivers last week after its nightclub was forced to shut.
Derek Forsyth, of accountancy firm Campbell Dallas, said today: &quot;It is with great regret that we have had no option but to make 129 members of staff redundant with immediate effect.
&quot;A small number will be retained to assist with the administration. We will work with relevant agencies to provide as much support to the affected staff as is possible.&quot;
Arches bosses said they were left with no choice but to shut the nightspot after licensing bosses ordered it to close at midnight.
The ruling followed a series of police complaints about drug misuse and disorder.
Mr Forsyth said: &quot;The Arches was facing unsustainable cashflow problems and despite an immense effort by the board and funding partners, it was clear that administration was the only option for the companies.
&quot;As a result of an uncertain future income profile, the venue will immediately close.
&quot;We have already contacted various funding partners and stakeholders to consider all options going forward and to see whether elements of the business may be resurrected.
&quot;The Arches is an internationally-recognised brand and we would encourage interested parties to make contact as soon as possible.&quot;
 Almost 40,000 people signed a petition calling for the reinstatement of the venue's licence and author Irvine Welsh and members of Franz Ferdinand were among those who put their name to an open letter calling on the Government and creative bodies to ensure The Arches remains as an arts venue. 
 Police raised licensing issues last year after the drug-related death of 17-year-old Regane MacColl at the club and a number of other incidents. 
Today, dance stars Slam have hit out the club's treatment by the police.

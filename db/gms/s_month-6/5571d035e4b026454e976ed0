 A MAN who was badly hurt in a road rage killing that led to a gangster being jailed is seeking &pound;9million compensation. 
 Lee Allsup suffered a serious head injury, fractures to the hip and thigh and a punctured lung when Paul Lyons collided with a van he was travelling in on the M74 in Lanarkshire in June 2009. 
 Lyons, 33, was later jailed for 12 years after admitting the culpable homicide of Mark Fleeman , a shopfitter from Staffordshire who died when he was thrown from the van when it overturned. 
Disqualified driver Lyons was under the influence of drink and drugs and had been driving at up to 100mph.
Lawyers acting for Lee, 23, raised an action against the gangster, formerly of Bonnybridge, Stirlingshire, and the Motor Insurers’ Bureau.
 A full hearing is scheduled for next May but the case called before Lord Boyd at the Court of Session in  Edinburgh yesterday. 
Lee, whose address was given as care of a legal firm, was initially treated in Wishaw General Hospital before being transferred to England for more treatment and rehabilitation.
He is said to continue to suffer short-term memory loss, flashbacks, restricted mobility and pain.
 It’s maintained the former trainee mechanic is unlikely to return to any form of employment or to be able  to live independently without support. 
 The Motor Insurers’ Bureau, who provide compensation in certain circumstances to people who are injured as  a result of negligence by uninsured motorists, say the sum sued for is excessive. 
They contend Lee could live independently with limited support and is capable of part-time employment.
Lyons, who is an inmate at Kilmarnock prison, has not put in defences to the action.

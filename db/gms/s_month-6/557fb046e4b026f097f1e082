A BRIDE-to-be’s hen party has been ruined after she lost &pound;2000 in a Spanish villa booking scandal.
Stacey Cahill and her friends paid the cash to Rainbow Villas Realty, a firm who claimed to manage luxury Villa Blue in Marbella, Spain.
But weeks before the girls’ trip, the company – run by Mark and Michelle Stafford – emailed to say they had “ceased trading” and wouldn’t be able to provide a refund.
The Scots have now discovered they are among hundreds of holidaymakers left out of pocket by the firm.
Sickened Stacey, 27, from Provanmill, Glasgow, said: “I couldn’t believe my eyes when I read the email.
“This was supposed to be the holiday of a lifetime but it has been completely ruined.”
Stacey, who is marrying fiance David later in the summer, added: “I feel awful for all my friends who gave me their money to pay this woman. It is a mess.
“We have contacted police and a Facebook page has been set up where there are hundreds of people claiming they have lost money as a result of this. It’s a disgrace.”
A Facebook group for victims now has 300 members, many of whom lost as much as &pound;4000. Some insist the company double and triple-booked the same villa before shutting down.
A spokeswoman for Owners Direct, the website where the villa was advertised, said: “From our initial investigations, we believe that Rainbow Villas, having run a legitimate business advertising on Owners Direct for over 18 months, appear to have acted dishonestly during these final weeks of trading.
“We are incredibly disappointed in their conduct.
“Given these circumstances, we will be offering our Basic Rental Guarantee to travellers, entitling them to compensation up to the value of &pound;700.”

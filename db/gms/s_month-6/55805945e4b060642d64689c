A MAN has died after being found with head injuries outside a block of flats.
Police say they are treating the death as “unexplained” after he was discovered around 9.30pm last night.
Forensic teams have been at the scene around the building on Cumbernauld Road in Riddrie, Glasgow, which has been closed off throughout night and this morning.
Officers are attempting to establish the identity of the victim, and a post mortem will be carried out.

He is described as white, believed to be in his 50s or 60s with a shaven head. He was wearing a dark pinstripe suit, white shirt and black shoes.
A woman who lives in one of the flats, across from Alexandria Park, said she had been awoken by police activity in the street.
She added: “We were then woken up by detectives doing door to door checks around 1am in the morning.
“There were forensics officers going about in white suits as well.
“No-one will really tell us what it happening.”
Detective Chief Inspector Laura McLuckie said: “We need to find out who this man is and how he came about his injuries. We will be reviewing CCTV images in an effort to try and piece together the man’s movements prior to him being found in Cumbernauld Road. If you recognise the description or if you have any information or knowledge as to the man’s identity or what may have happened to him, please do contact us as a matter of urgency.”
The incident also caused early morning traffic chaos with the north bound carriageway of Cumbernauld Road shut off by police.
A spokeswoman for Police Scotland added: “About 9.30pm last night (MON) a man was found injured on Cumbernauld Road.
“He was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary but died on route.
“The death is being treated as unexplained at the moment.”

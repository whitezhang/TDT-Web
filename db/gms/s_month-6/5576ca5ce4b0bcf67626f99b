ONE of Scotland’s top chefs has swapped his trade secrets on how to make the perfect curry – for a hair transplant.
Monir Mohammed, who runs Glasgow curry house Mother India, struck the deal with Glasgow Clinic owner Fraser Christensen when he went to ask about his thinning barnet.
Fraser quizzed Monir on his secrets and offered him the exchange – his curry skills for new hair.
Monir had the follicular unit extraction transplant yesterday.
Fraser, 54, whose clinic treated former &shy;Scotland star James McFadden last year, said: “I love cooking and especially love curries.
“For years I’ve tried recipes from various cookbooks and never managed to make it taste the same way it does when you dine out.
“When Monir introduced himself as the owner and chef behind Mother India during his consultation, the conversation switched to my obsession of trying to cook the perfect curry.
“Monir has a cookbook himself and I’ve yet to try his recipes but that started the discussion of a hair &shy;transplant for a lesson at his home.
“I couldn’t miss the &shy;opportunity and the exchange sounded like a great idea. He was delighted and took up the challenge straight away.”

Dad-of-two Monir, who established Mother India in 1990, said: “I’m more than happy to give him a lesson.
“He can choose a recipe and I’ll share a few of my home-cooking secrets, and I guarantee it will taste as good as it does in our &shy;restaurant.”
Monir’s hair transplant involved taking about 1000 complete hair follices from his scalp using a punch.
They were harvested under a microscope using thin blades or needles to create new incisions before they were re-planted at selected sites.
Monir, 51, continued: “I can’t wait to see the results over the coming months.
“And I’m really looking forward to tasting Fraser’s curry and making sure he’s able to cook a good dish.”

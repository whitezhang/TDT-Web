DID you ever dream of dunking your parents in gunge when you were a child?
Now is your chance to send whoever you like into the dreaded ‘Gunk Dunk’ when cult 90s TV show Get Your Own Back hits the Edinburgh Festival this summer.
The popular children’s CBBC programme, which saw children take revenge on family members and teachers by dunking them in gunge, will be adapted for the festival.
And, this time it’s not just for children to enjoy.
The show’s original presenter Dave Benson Phillips promises a “live version of the fast-paced slapstick game show” with plenty of gunge when the show arrives in the capital.
Get Your Own Back: Live! will take place at the Gilded Balloon’s Debating Hall at 4.30pm from August 5 to August 31 with tickets on sale now.

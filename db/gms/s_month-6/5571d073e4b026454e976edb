A CAR PARK firm have been forced to cancel &pound;20,000 worth of fines they handed out at a supermarket.
 Euro Car Parks wrongly issued more than 300 notices to drivers outside a branch of Sainsbury’s , alleging breaches of terms and conditions. 
The firm manage the car park for the supermarket. But the motorists who were given the fines had parked on land not owned by Sainsbury’s.
And in another bungle, paperwork sent to the drivers by the London-based car park firm also quoted legislation that doesn’t even apply in Scotland.
Following a complaint, Aberdeenshire Council investigated.
Euro Car Parks admitted they had no legal right to issue the fines.
  
And they agreed to refund 64 paid fines worth &pound;2830 and cancel 246 outstanding notices worth &pound;17,220.
 The gaffe happened outside Sainsbury’s Garthdee in Aberdeen . 
A council spokesman said: “Euro Car Parks agreed to continue to work with trading standards to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”
The paperwork sent to motorists by Euro Car Parks quotes a law that allows private parking firms to pursue payment of unpaid notices from registered vehicle keepers. 
But that only applies in England and Wales. In Scotland, only the driver can be held liable for a parking charge notice.

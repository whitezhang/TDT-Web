A 75-YEAR-OLD man whose son was stabbed to death has been given an MBE for his passionate campaign against knife crime.And John Muir, 75, from Inverkip, was determined to change the law after his son Damian died following a violent attack in Greenock in 2007.Barry Gavin, 26, from Greenock, who already had a stabbing charge pending, as well as previous charges of knife possession at the time of the attack, was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 15 years for Damian's murder.John set up the Inverclyde anti-knife group as he pushed for a mandatory sentence for those involved in knife crime.He said he was accepting the award &quot;on behalf of all the victims of knife crime, anyone who has lost a family member and all the people I have worked with to fight against the high levels of this awful crime.&quot;Johnthrew himself into campaigning, writing hundreds of letters, lobbying parliament for changes in the law on knife crime and speaking at schools, colleges and in his local community.He said: &quot;I still think tougher sentencing is needed for knife crime in Scotland and I will keep fighting for that.&quot;A knife knows no boundaries and people need to learn of the consequences and heartbreak knifing someone can have.&quot;He said he was over the moon about being commended for his work, adding: &quot;It's so nice to be recognised.&quot;At the beginning I always said if I could just save one life I'd be happy but the knife crime figures have dropped considerably since then.&quot;Among the recipients of a Medal of British Empire (BEM) is 41-year-old Amanda MacTaggart, 41, from Clydebank.She was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2012, 13 days after her wedding and has since set up Wigbank to help cancer sufferers cope with the traumatic experience of losing their hair.She said: &quot;The process was harrowing but I had three teenage kids I had to be strong for.&quot;It felt awful when my hair started to fall out and I found Glasgow was lacking of places where you could get a wig and have a nice experience in doing so.&quot;She had concerns about the impersonal process involved in selecting a wig for cancer sufferers.Amanda then visited Wigbank in Perth and decided to bring it to Glasgow.People are able to donate their wigs to the shop and they are then sold for &pound;20.She ensures the experience is an enjoyable one, injecting fun into a serious matter and relieving the stress and worry for women when they are at their most vulnerable.She said: &quot;It's about empowering women and making them feel good at their worst time.&quot;I'm so happy that the shop is getting recognition and I'm so happy to fight for the women that are going through a terrible time.&quot;We're definitely bringing sexy back to wigs!&quot;The Wigbank has grown quickly and has secured larger premises.The shop gives women the opportunity to learn about make-up, relaxation, therapies and hair styling after their treatment ends.

Gymnast Amy Regan marks International Handstand DayFIVE-time Scottish gymnastics all-around champion Amy Regan shows how it is done as International Handstand Day is celebrated across the world today.The 20-year-old from Giffnock will be joined by celebrities, sports stars and the public in busting out her best handstand moves.The 2015 World Gymnastics Championships will be held at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow from October 23 until November 1 with tickets on sale now.More than 500 gymnasts from 80 nations will descend on the city for the event.To mark the occasion, organisers are asking people to share their favourite handstand photographs and videos on Twitter and Facebook using the hashtag #IHD2015.&quot;The celebrities I would most love to see doing a handstand are Kim Kardashian, David Beckham and Beyonce,&quot; said Amy. &quot;The trick to a good handstand is to always keep your arms straight, tummy tight and legs together to help balance.&quot;Although Amy admitted she isn't a natural herself. &quot;I'm not actually the best at handstands â€“ I prefer power moves such as backflips and somersaults,&quot; she said.&quot;I can hold a handstand for just under a minute but I know people who can do them for up to two minutes at a time.&quot;While she won't be competing at the SSE Hydro this autumn, Amy is hoping to line-up a volunteer role.&quot;The 2015 World Gymnastics Championships in Glasgow is a fantastic opportunity to see the world's best gymnasts right on our doorstep,&quot; she said.&quot;It is not something that will happen again for many years to come. It is also the team qualifier for the Olympic Games so it is vital that the British public back the GB team to help them secure their places for Rio 2016.&quot;

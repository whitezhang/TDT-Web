 A HOUSE blaze in which a man died is likely to have been caused by an electric blanket, according to fire investigators. 
 Crews were called to the property in Fifth Avenue in the Anniesland area of Glasgow at around 3.30am on Monday. 
 The man was given treatment for severe burns and smoke inhalation by officers before paramedics took him to hospital, but he later died. 
The fire service initially said the blaze might have been caused by a cigarette setting bedding alight but following work by specialist officers from the fire investigation unit, it is now believed the likely source was an electric blanket.
Assistant Chief Officer Lewis Ramsay said: &quot;In the wake of this tragedy everyone's thoughts will of course be with the man's family and friends.
&quot;The loss of life through fire in the home will certainly be felt across the community and it will profoundly touch many people.
&quot;We must all be asking ourselves if we know someone who could be at risk and thinking about those who are older, who have health conditions or who live alone and might be a bit isolated.
&quot;Our crews can provide them with support to reduce the risk they will experience a fire or be hurt as a result, so anyone who is concerned about a friend, a relative or a neighbour should contact us now.&quot;

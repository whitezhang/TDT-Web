THREE 12-year-old boys have been found with knives in school during the past two days.The three were discovered by school staff in three different schools in the east of the city.Police spoke out about the incidents to raise awareness among parents and warn them to keep an eye on what their children were taking to school.Chief Inspector Stevie Hazlett, area commander for Glasgow East, warned that even simple objects such as felt pens could conceal blades when the lids were removed.He said the three boys were challenged by school staff following information they became aware of.He added: &quot;One claimed to have found the knife. It could be a trophy or bravado.&quot;They could be carrying them to show off to their friends not realising the potential implications.&quot;He said there was nothing to suggest there was a particular trend developing and the three incidents were not linked in any way.He said they occurred in three different areas of Glasgow.He added: &quot;They were craft type knives.&quot;We have been working with our partners in schools to make sure violence is reduced as much as possible.&quot;We want to make parents aware and it wouldn't hurt for them to have a look in their school bags.&quot;The fact that we've got three 12 year-olds found in possession of knives speaks for itself.&quot;Chief Insp Hazlett said they had discovered knives being carried by children younger than 12 in the past but it was &quot;very, very rare.&quot;He said: &quot;This came to light because we work with the schools. We want to make parents aware.&quot;The three boys are to be reported to the children's panel.Figures published at the end of 2014 showed 181 weapons were seized in schools across Scotland during 2013/14.Dangerous items confiscated after pupils either used or threatened to use them included pen knives, stones, pool cues, a hack saw and the branch of a tree.Some of the items were confiscated in nurseries and from primary one pupils, while more of the serious weapons were removed from youngsters up to the age of 17.

A Glasgow pensioner who bet &pound;30,000 on a Conservative majority at the UK general election has collected his &pound;240,000 winnings.
The man placed his bet at odds of 7/1 in a branch of Ladbrokes in the city centre on 29 April.
When the punter failed to immediately collect his &pound;30,000 stake and &pound;210,000 winnings, the bookmaker made a public appeal for him to come forward.
Polling in the lead-up to the 7 May election indicated a hung parliament.
However, the Conservative Party won a slim majority in the House of Commons.
Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said: &quot;I can confirm that the gentleman has been paid in full and has specifically asked not to be identified.
&quot;Once again, we congratulate him on his record-breaking election win.&quot;

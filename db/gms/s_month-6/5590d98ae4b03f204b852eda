Campaigners call for LGBTI education to become statutory in Scottish schoolsCAMPAIGNERS are calling for LGBTI education in all Scottish schools.Representatives from the Time for Inclusive Education (TIE) group have launched a petition calling for young people to be taught about issues relating to the lesbian, gay,bisexual,transgender and intersexed community.Campaign founders Jordan Daly and Liam Stevenson say by talking about these issues in school it will help tackle homophobic attitudes in young people, and increase confidence among the LGBTI community.A report into the experience of LGBTI pupils at schools in Scotland found that 54% do not feel part of their school communities, while 71% regularly skip school.More than half of those who have experienced direct homophobic bullying are regularly self-harming, while 26% of those bullied have attempted suicide.

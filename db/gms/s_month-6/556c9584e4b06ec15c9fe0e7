A hospital job advert that warned applicants they would have to deal with &quot;irate surgeons&quot; has been withdrawn despite attracting 61 applicants. 
The advert was for a theatre nursing support worker at Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow.
It also warned applicants they would face &quot;verbal and physical aggressive behaviour from patients&quot;. 
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the advert was a practical joke which had slipped through HR checks.

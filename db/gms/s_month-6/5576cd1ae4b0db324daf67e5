Inverness-based delivery company AJG Parcels has been acquired by logistics firm Menzies Distribution.
AJG has grown from delivering 20 packages a day 20 years ago to making 9,000 deliveries and 800 pick-ups daily.
It has 140 staff and a fleet of more than 100 vehicles fitted with GPS equipment.
The firm also runs depots at Linwood near Glasgow, Dunoon, Lochgilphead, Oban and Fort William.
Its area includes the Western Isles and Orkney.
Forsyth Black, managing director of Menzies Distribution, said: &quot;The purchase of AJG is an important step in our ongoing journey to build on our newspaper and magazine distribution business. 
&quot;It is especially significant because it allows us to participate in the fast-growing market of parcel delivery and collection.&quot;

THE journey of St Mungo will be one of many explored by a national network of pilgrim routes in Scotland.The Pilgrim Guide to Scotland, written by Donald Smith from Glasgow, sets out 14 historical routes each dedicated to a particular saint.An accompanying website was also launched at an event in Glasgow Cathedral yesterday, which featured many of those who had helped form the journeys.He said: &quot;Each route takes you to famous and well known locations, and to many remote and little known beauty spots as well. The routes are so diverse.&quot;There are beautiful stories and landscapes.&quot;Every region has got their local traditions, which reflect the culture of that part of the country. &quot;Locals have not forgotten about them, it's part of their heritage, and they often hold on to them tenaciously.&quot;Coming To The Clyde celebrates the &quot;turbulent&quot; journey of St Mungo, patron saint of the city, tracing a route from the east coast to the return from exile concluding in Glasgow.Other pilgrimages also pass through the area.The book has been researched over 25 years, inspired by Mr Smith's love of history and created for the 900th anniversary of the death of St Margaret.&quot;I saw the details of all the sites related to her, and I thought that there could be a journey there.&quot;Since then I've done that for other saints, systematically exploring these places.&quot;I've been to every location in the guidebook.&quot;People are already getting back into these pilgrimages again. A lot of people don't always realise the breadth and scale of the tradition which exists.&quot;Visitors from other countries already come to places like Iona and St Andrews, this could definitely be a boost for Scotland.&quot;The journeys are broken into several stages, allowing potential pilgrims to carefully choose which parts they go on.Stories and reflections feature more prominently in the book, but the website also hosts much of the information. Details are given for public transport as well as walking routes.The well-travelled author also offers one top tip: &quot;Always takes a paper map. Don't rely on your phone.&quot;Pilgrim Guide to Scotland is published by Saint Andrew Press, and the accompany website can be found at http://www.scotlandspilgrimjourneys.com/.

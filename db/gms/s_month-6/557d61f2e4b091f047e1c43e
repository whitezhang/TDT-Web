Detectives have made a fresh pledge to find the body of missing bookkeeper Suzanne Pilley – five years after she was last seen.
A massive investigation was launched after Suzanne, 38, from Edinburgh, failed to turn up for work in May 2010.
The probe became a murder inquiry and her former lover David Gilroy was arrested and charged with murder in June 2010.
Gilroy, 52, was convicted in March 2012 and is serving a life sentence, with a recommendation he serve a minimum of 18 years in prison.
 

He has never revealed the location of Suzanne’s body and detectives have vowed to act on any new leads in their bid to trace her.
DCI Stuart Houston said: “To date, Suzanne’s remains have not been recovered. However, whenever we receive intelligence relating to their potential location, we will investigate thoroughly and utilise all the relevant resources at the police’s disposal.”
A police source said last week they would “always follow up any potential leads in a bid to help bring closure to Suzanne’s family”.
 

Suzanne, who had previously had a relationship with Gilroy, set off on her usual journey to work in Edinburgh city centre but did not arrive.
The jury in Gilroy’s trial heard he was driven by jealousy and carried out a series of acts to cover up his crime. He took Suzanne’s body to a secret grave, believed to be in Argyll.
The case made legal history when Gilroy became the first convicted killer to have his sentencing filmed for British TV.

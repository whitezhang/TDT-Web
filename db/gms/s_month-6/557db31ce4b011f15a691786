DURAN DURAN legend Simon Le Bon says he and the band would love to play T in the Park if they were asked.
Simon is appearing at Bestival this year as well as Sonar Festival in Barcelona, Spain and Night at the Park, in The Hague, Netherlands.
He is playing Glasgow’s SSE Hydro with the band on 6th December this year, but reckons playing T would be another experience to add to his list.
He said: “T in the Park is definitely something we’d consider. I’d love to do it. We have an agent who looks after these things.”
But Simon has ruled out getting down and dirty with other campers on site - unlike some of the bands who have played T in the Past.
The View, Amy MacDonald and One Night Only have all wrestled with canvas at the fest but Simon said: “Me being me, I’d not be camping and definitely not if we were playing it. I’d stay in a nice hotel so I could look good on stage and I’d try like to come in by helicopter.”
Simon has been coming to Scotland since 1980 and always enjoys exploring new venues here.
He said: “We have great relationships with fans in Glasgow and Edinburgh and some of our favourite shows of the whole tour have been here. The 02 is fantastic in Glasgow and I love the Armadillo too. We also played Barrowlands which is an incredible place.”

WORK will start this month on hundreds of student flats which are to be built in a Â£67million development near Glasgow University.Select Property Group has bought a site in Beith Street, 500m from the university and 100m from Partick Subway station.It plans to build 441 self contained studio flats incorporating 501 beds which will be developed, let and managed under the company's Vita Student brand.The company presently has developments in Bristol, Exeter, Manchester, Liverpool, Southampton and Sheffield providing students with state-of-the-art apartments and facilities including gyms, movie theatres and bespoke study areas.Mark Stott, chief executive officer of Select Property Group, described the Glasgow purchase as a major milestone for the business.He said: &quot;Glasgow is Scotland's largest city and houses six universities which attract an international market of more than 80,000 students as one of Europe's most popular places to study.&quot;The redevelopment of the city's West End presents an outstanding opportunity for us to deliver a legacy of unique and inspirational living environments for the students of Glasgow.&quot;With year-on-year rental rates rising by 1.6% in April, our new Vita Student development presents a compelling proposition for students and investors alike.&quot;Our revolutionary end-to-end service means we develop, let and manage our properties, ensuring the best possible service for customers.&quot;Glasgow is an ideal addition to our existing portfolio of more than 1000 student beds across leading university towns and cities throughout the UK.&quot;City council planners gave the scheme the go-ahead after hearing there is a massive shortage of accommodation for young people at city universities.Because of the recent number of applications for student flats in the West End, councillors demanded a study be carried out.It found there is were a total of 50,880 full-time students and 14,195 part-time students attending Glasgow, Strathclyde and Caledonian universities, Glasgow School of Art and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland.The five main higher education institutions in the city offer accommodation for 6219 students - often only to first-year students - which is only 10% of the total student population in the city.The private sector offers accommodation for 4678 students which is around 7% of the student population.In recent months, 15 student accommodation developments have received planning permission and are under construction or yet to be started. These will provide a further 2714 student beds.A report from Richard Brown, the council's executive director of development and regeneration, said: &quot;When combined, these factors offer accommodation for 13,611 students which is 21% of all students, meaning 51,645 students are residing at home with parents, in HMO's or other private rented accommodation.&quot;Partick community council has raised concerns about the over development of student accommodation in the area.

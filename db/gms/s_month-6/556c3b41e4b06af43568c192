Toryglen Community Group Urban Roots celebrated after a landmark decision came for a piece of woodland they manage.
Malls Mire Community Nature Reserve is a site of importance for nature conservation that is bordered by Toryglen, Rutherglen, housing schemes and a railway line. It is described as a little piece of beauty and tranquility in amongst urban madness and sprawl.
Eco group Urban Roots, who operate out of Toryglen Community Base, manage the space.
 Now the Glasgow side of the site, which equates to about 85 per cent of the woodland, has been awarded Local Nature Reserve status.  Scottish Natural Heritage describe Local Nature Reserves as “areas of at least locally important natural heritage, designated and managed by local authorities to give people better opportunities to learn about and enjoy nature close to where they live.” 
Urban Roots have put a lot of effort in to ensure the award of the status, including securing funding and overseeing the building of a path network for people to walk through the reserve. They also routinely clean up the area and hold information sessions for local schools.
It is something the group had been trying to establish for a while and now means that the woodland will be protected by European conservation legislation.
Community Ranger with Urban Roots Tom Cooper over saw the project and thinks this will encourage more people to use the facility: “It’s very good news. It means a greater level of protection for the woodland, for example any development that would be built round the woodland would have to be checked by Scottish National Heritage.
“I think it will help to improve he image of the woodland as it has been perceived quite negatively by people in the past with regards to anti social behaviour, which doesn’t happen there now.”

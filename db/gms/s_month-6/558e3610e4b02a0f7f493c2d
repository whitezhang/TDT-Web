Matheson insists he's 'going nowhere' as SNP join calls for him to quitTHE SNP has joined calls for Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson to quit but allies insist he is “going nowhere”.The Evening Times revealed last night that the embattled Scottish Labour politician, who is bidding to be the party’s deputy leader, is facing demands from his own councillors to resign.Mr Matheson revealed yesterday that he will stand down at the Labour group’s next AGM on May 16 2016, whether or not he is elected deputy leader.Former MSP Frank McAveety, who is believed to want the top job in Glasgow, then rounded on the council leader, demanding that he quits “sooner rather than later”.He was backed by Councillor George Redmond who insisted “Gordon needs to go”.Councillor Jonathan Findlay suggested the Labour group should not challenge the leader until after three city by-elections in August.Now SNP group leader Susan Aitken has launched a stinging attack on Mr Matheson and told Labour councillors to stop “obsessing over their own internal divisions and feuds”.She said: “It’s been clear for some time now that Councillor Matheson is primarily interested in the council as a vehicle for self-promotion.“When it comes to the real problems in the city – like the ongoing crisis in homelessness services – he refuses to step up and take responsibility.“He’s made it pretty clear he doesn’t really want to be here and on that basis he should go as soon as possible.”Mr Matheson refused to be drawn on the criticism last night but a source close to the council leader said: “The SNP want Gordon to go now because they know he's the most effective leader Glasgow has got.“Gordon is going nowhere. Gordon is concentrating on leading the city and on his election campaign for the deputy leadership of the Scottish Labour Party.“He's very relaxed. He's absolutely concentrating on the jobs in hand and the little gnats on the sidelines don't perturb him.”Despite demanding Mr Matheson quits, Ms Aitken said a change at the top of the Labour administration in Glasgow “will make little real difference”.“It’s clear that opposition to Councillor Matheson within the Labour group is driven by concern about the future of the Labour Party, not concern about the people of Glasgow,” she told The Evening Times.“The real problem is a deep seated culture within Labour that views the city of Glasgow as theirs to do whatever they choose with, coupled with an attitude of arrogance bordering on contempt towards citizens, service users and frontline council staff.”She added: “Glaswegians need councillors and a council leader who will fight on their behalf against the Westminster austerity agenda that is causing deep damage to the city – not spend all their time chasing patronage and looking out for their own careers.”A Scottish Labour source in the city chambers said: “The SNP were presumptuous in the run up to the local elections in 2012 when Labour won a resounding victory against every prediction - we will do the same in 2017.”

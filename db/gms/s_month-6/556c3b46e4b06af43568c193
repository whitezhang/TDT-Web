HITMAN William Paterson visited a member of the Lyons crime clan in prison the day after he executed Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll, the Record can reveal.
The murderer, who had been sent by the clan to assassinate their hated enemy Gerbil, went to jail with three henchmen to see Paul Lyons.
An underworld source said: “Paterson and his associates were very careful what they said when they met Paul.
“He already knew Gerbil was dead. They could hardly start celebrating but they all knew why they were there.”
The jail meeting happened on January 14, 2010.
The day before, Carroll was shot 13 times in front of shoppers as he sat in an Audi at the Asda car park in Robroyston, Glasgow.
Last week, Paterson was jailed for 22 years for Carroll’s murder.
Gangland sadist Carroll was a feared enforcer with the rival Daniel gang.
The Lyons and the Daniels had been in a tit-for-tat battle for years and Carroll’s execution was a revenge killing.
Mobile phone analysis revealed the murder gang travelled to Addiewell Prison, West Lothian, for a meeting with Lyons as a manhunt began for the Asda killers.
Having disposed of the guns and successfully torched the getaway car, the brazen gang felt they were above the law.
Three months after the Gerbil summit, Lyons, 33, of Bonnybridge, Lanarkshire, was jailed for 12 years for killing a van driver on the M74 motorway.
The thug, who was high on drink and drugs, rammed 32-year-old Mark Fleeman’s van in a road-rage incident near Larkhall, Lanarkshire, in June 2009.

In the south side earlier this month, several schools got together for a mass rubbish-collection on a walk to the national stadium at Hampden.This fantastic Streets Ahead army of more than 40 schoolchildren, with the support of Clean Glasgow, cleaned up the south side.The event was designed to make young people aware of littering – and take action against it.Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairman of Clean Glasgow, said: “We all want our city to look its best and it’s fantastic to see our young people leading by example and demonstrating the message at the heart of our People Make Glasgow Cleaner campaign.“If everyone plays their part we can make sure that Glasgow is a clean and safe environment for everyone.”After their hard work, the pupils – from Holycross, Croftfoot and Blackfriars Primary Schools and Kings Park and Holyrood secondaries, were treated to lunch and a tour of the Hampden Experience.GHA is helping tenants sow the seeds of strong, healthy communities.Community gardens and allotments are helping tenants of GHA, Cube Housing Association and Loretto Housing Association - which are all part of Wheatley Group - get out into the fresh air and lead healthier lives.And as well as eating nutritious food, gardens and allotments are helping bring people together and creating a real sense of community.Tenants of the high-rise blocks in Sandyhills, in the north east of Glasgow grow healthy, tasty vegetables - and with the help of a former top chef who lives in the blocks, tenants share the food they grow by cooking free hearty soup every week for residents.Margaret Reidford, chairwoman of the Sandyhills High Flats Tenants’ Association, said: “It can be very isolated in the high-rise blocks, and there are many different nationalities here. It’s important to get out and meet people.“We arrange barbecues for residents to help people mix. One of our tenants is a former chef at Gleneagles and he makes free soup every week.“It makes for a community that works together and helps each other.”HOW TO GET INVOLVEDWhether it’s clean-ups or community gardens, we want to hear what you are doing to improve your community.With the support of our partners, City Charitable Trust, Scottish Fire and Rescue, ScotRail, Glasgow Housing Association and Clean Glasgow, we can help turn your dreams into reality.Get involved by emailing streetsahead@heraldandtimes.co.uk.

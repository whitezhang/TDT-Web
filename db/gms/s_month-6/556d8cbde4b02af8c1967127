POLICE are set to drop the 20-year probe into the death of a mum-of-three.
Detectives in Glasgow say they do not know if Marjorie Roberts, a 34-year-old prostitute was pushed or fell into the River Clyde.
Her body was discovered in August 1995 near Jamaica Bridge in the city.
The death was thought to be linked to a series of murders involving prostitutes in Glasgow from the early 1990s to the murder of Emma Caldwell in 2005.
It was even speculated that a serial killer could be responsible for the deaths.
Now Police Scotland has said that in the case of Marjorie “no criminality has been established”, says the Glasgow Evening Times.
A police spokeswoman said: ”Following a detailed investigation into the death of Marjorie Roberts, no criminality could be established and a full report was submitted to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal service.”
It is thought there were no witnesses to Marjorie’s death, though CCTV footage did show her with a man on the Broomielaw, next to the river, hours before she was found dead.
No marks were found on her body.

@WilsonC75HTFANCY a new home.....in one of Glasgow's oldest graveyards.If you aren't easily spooked, Janefield Cemetery Lodge, in the Eastern Necropolis, boasts extensive grounds. The neighbours aren't likely to complain either.The B-listed building, which dates from around 1860, is being transformed by Parkhead Housing Association into a 2-bedroomed house for social renting.The lodge, which sits at the entrance to the graveyard, was previously used as a waiting room and office for the management of the Necropolis, but has been vacant for many years and was in a bad state of repair.Parkhead Housing Association has been given funding by Glasgow City Council, Historic Scotland and the national lottery as part of a &pound;4million plan to restore the Parkhead Cross area.The &pound;300,000 project is expected to be completed by late July.Andy Duffus, development and regeneration manager said: &quot;The building has not been in use for around 10 years and even then, it was only used by grounds staff.&quot;It's a shell. We are in the process of rebuilding the walls and restoring the roof.&quot;We see it as a really important building for the area. It is a landmark as you come into the Parkhead area.&quot;It would be shame to see it pulled down.&quot;The original single-storey building dates back to the mid 18th century when, in 1758 Robert McNair, a successful grocer, bought the lands of Little Hill of Tollcross from Patrick Tod for &pound;100.He married Jean Holms and the couple built a dwelling-house on the lands, which was known as 'Jeanfield' to honour his spouse.The property remained within the family until 1797 when printer John Mennons purchased the estate.Mennons edited and printed the Glasgow Advertiser, which was the forerunner to the Glasgow Herald.In 1846 Jeanfield was purchased by the Eastern Cemetery Joint-stock Company with the aim of laying out a necropolis to serve the east end of the city.By 1847 the original dwelling of Robert McNair was demolished and work began on laying out the burial ground.A cemetery was opened by Glasgow Hebrew Congregation at the Eastern Necropolis (Janefield) in Parkhead in 1855. It was the city's third Necropolis, after the larger southern Necropolis opened in the Gorbals.Dublin-born Maria Barnett, who died of 'inflammation of the brain' in September 1855 was the first to be buried there.Among the notables buried there are; Am Bard Ileach, a major Gaelic poet who campaigned against the clearances and destruction of Gaelic culture.Alexander Cruikshanks who was &quot;accidentally killed while keeping goal for Strathclyde FC versus Rutherglen Glencairn FC, on June 12 1932, aged 24&quot;.

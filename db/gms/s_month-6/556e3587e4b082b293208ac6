Britain’s Got Talent illusionist Darcy Oake has defended this year’s winner Jules O’Dwyer for using a stunt dog during the final show.
Viewers have reacted angrily after it emerged that Matisse the winning dog did not perform the walk across the tightrope himself.
But Darcy, who is currently in Scotland to promote his own magical show at Glasgow’s Clyde Auditorium on September 19, said: “I honestly don’t understand what the big deal is.

“Even though I’m a magician I didn’t connect that’s what happened until the article came out about it - and that’s what I do. Kudos to Jules for that.
“I’m surprised at the backlash because she has one amazingly trained dog then another amazingly trained dog and now a stunt dog so if anything it shows the ability she has to do it three times.
People get so worked up about it and I think ‘Good on you. You swapped the dog out then out it back again and people only noticed when you told them.’ “
The Canadian magician, who wowed with his dove act last year, added: “In the UK when you are shooting magic there are legitimate laws. You can’t use fake reactions and obviously the TV people knew what was going on so I don’t think they should take her prize away.”

A sheriff has slammed friends who staged an elaborate baby hoax over nearly three years as “callous” and “wicked”.
Vikki Gilmore (29) of Perth and Chris Yates (35) of Glasgow have each been sentenced to three years after they were unanimously found guilty of the deception last month.
Their complex tale included telling the rightful dad that his unborn child had been aborted when in fact it had been passed to Yates, that another woman had given birth to the girl; and also on the child’s birth certificate which showed Yates as the dad.
At Perth Sheriff Court on Tuesday Sheriff William Wood hit out at the pair for failing to admit to their crime and their lack of insight into the damage it could cause the child, who is now four.
Sheriff Wood said: “You pretended to the registrar that you were the parents; you continued to pretend to (dad) Steven North that his child had been aborted.
“In all respects that was a calculated and cynical attempt to deny a father from his child.”
The couple’s story came unstuck after friends questioned their tales and found inconsistencies. A Facebook profile set up as part of the deception, for a lesbian lawyer in Edinburgh said to be the surrogate for the child, also brought suspicion.
But it wasn’t until Mr North brought the case to the attention of the authorities, and an exclusive story in the Perthshire Advertiser about his suspicions, that the case was elevated.
It ended with a trial last month after which the pair were found guilty by a jury.

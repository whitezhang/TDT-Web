A CAT missing for 18 years turned up out of the blue - but was put to sleep before it was reunited with its owner.Animal lover Laura Rennie, 39, was &quot;stunned&quot; to get a visit from the SPCA last week telling her the pet she lost 18 years ago had been found - just 15 minutes from her Dennistoun home.But her joy was short-lived after a vet at the animal centre where it was being cared for told her Toby had to be put down as soon as possible and she couldn't wait the 20 minutes it would take Laura to get there.Laura, who has worked at Glasgow and Edinburgh zoos, was left devastated, saying she just wanted to be with her cat when it died and she missed &quot;the chance to say goodbye.&quot;She took Toby in as an abandoned kitten at just four weeks and hand-reared the feline at her home in Meadow Park Street, where she now lives in the flat above her mum.But, shortly after Laura turned 21, the tabby and white female cat went out one day and never came back.She said: &quot;We spent two to three months looking for her, we put posters up and phoned the council, but nothing.&quot;We thought she had died.&quot;Laura and her mum went on to care for more animals - two eight-week-old kittens Millie and Jones, Midge the Jack Russell - and currently Neo, a long-haired black cat.Laura added: &quot;I was out last Thursday when the SPCA called round and told my mum.&quot;She rang me and asked if I was sitting down. The SPCA had asked if we had a cat called Toby. They said: 'We've got her.' We couldn't believe it.&quot;She was traced because she was chipped. She had been found in someone's garden in Tollcross with a leg injury.&quot;Laura was asked if she wanted the cat back and if she would pay for the operation to its injury and she agreed.But, when she called the Bothwell SPCA centre the next morning, she said the attitude of the vet was unprofessional, and dismissive.Laura, who runs an animal therapy and petting zoo, said: &quot;She said the cat had had a nice long life but had a broken pelvis and badly damaged leg and it was in her best interest to be put to sleep.&quot;I was upset but I agreed and asked if I could see her before she was put down.&quot;Laura said the vet sighed, told her there was &quot;no benefit to be gained for you or the cat&quot; and &quot;there's no point&quot;.&quot;She said: 'I'd like to get it done sooner rather than later' and asked how long it would take me to get there.&quot;She denied me the chance to have closure and say goodbye to my cat. I wanted to see her, be with her when she died and bring her home to bury her.&quot;Laura formally complained to the SPCA about the vet's attitude, stressing that she supports the animal welfare charity and the centre, and the complaint relates simply to the attitude of the vet.She received an apology which said she should have been able to visit Toby.A Scottish SPCA spokesman said: &quot;Our vet advised Ms Rennie that it may be too upsetting for her to see Toby given her condition, however, we do understand why the owner wished to have the opportunity to say goodbye.&quot;We are very sorry this situation was not handled more sensitively, as it normally would be.&quot;Laura said she wanted the vet to be reprimanded and not be allowed to deal with the public.She said no one knows where Toby has been for the past 18 years but it was unlikely a cat would be able to survive outdoors during the winter so she believes someone has been looking after her pet.

TO mark Blood Donor Week, Glasgow's Donor Centre welcomed guests for an annual celebration for blood donors in Scotland.The week concludes with a global celebrations of World Blood Donor Day on June 14.This year, the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) is urging blood donors to be aware of their blood group and help make an ever bigger difference to Scotland's patients.Dr Moira Carter, Associate Director of Donor Services, SNBTS said: &quot;There are eight different blood groups and here in Scotland we must maintain 5-7 days of all blood groups at all times.&quot;We are asking all donors to support us over the summer months by knowing their own blood type.&quot;Right now we need donors from the two most common groups, O positive and A positive.&quot;This is about supporting patients over the whole summer period by matching their donations to patient's needs.&quot;And one mum who knows all too well about the importance of blood donation is Lisa Cannon, 37, from Livingston.16 weeks through her third pregnancy Lisa had developed anti-Kell antibodies to her baby's blood.The only way to treat my baby was by an Intrauterine Transfusion, which is a IUT-blood transfusion whilst in the womb.Lisa said: &quot;When I was 32 weeks pregnant, I was sent immediately to the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow and had my first O negative/Kell negative intrauterine transfusion, which was injected through my stomach directly into my baby's cord.&quot;This procedure can trigger pre term labour.&quot;You can imagine my joy and relief when our third son, Harrison, was born.&quot;I am so happy to be able to thank the blood donors who saved his life.&quot;

Police in Scotland are investigating a historic abuse complaint against Labour peer Lord Janner.The investigation relates to claims that Lord Janner took a boy north of the border in the 1970s and sexually assaulted him.Police Scotland said officers are carrying out an inquiry into a historic complaint.Detective Chief Superintendent Lesley Boal said: &quot;Police Scotland is conducting an investigation into an historic complaint and, as such, it would be inappropriate to comment.&quot;Police Scotland is absolutely committed to preventing all forms of child abuse and to keeping children safe, while bringing perpetrators of abuse to justice, regardless of the passage of time.&quot;The Daily Mail said the alleged victim made a report at a police station in Edinburgh in 1991.A Crown Office spokesman said: &quot;We have not received a report in relation to this matter.&quot;Last month the Crown Prosecution Service, covering England and Wales, said it would review its decision not to charge Lord Janner over allegations of historic child sex abuse.He was accused of a string of allegations during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s but was deemed unfit to stand trial because he is suffering from dementia.Justice Lowell Goddard, the New Zealand judge leading an independent inquiry into child sex abuse, said she would investigate claims against Lord Janner, and could even call him to give evidence.He has denied the previous allegations against him.

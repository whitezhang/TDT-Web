DETECTIVES are investigating the 'unexplained' death of a 45-year-old woman at her home in Fife.
Police are believed to have been called to a flat in Deas Wharf, Kirkcaldy shortly after 4am yesterday morning where they discovered the woman's body.
A cordon was thrown around the building which is next to the harbour in the town and forensic officers could be seen searching nearby bins and patches of grass.
However police said it was too early to speculate on a cause of death and said their enquiries were ongoing.
A police spokeswoman said: “Police in Fife are investigating following the death of a 45-year-old woman at an address in Deas Wharf, Kirkcaldy.
“The body was discovered yesterday at around 4.20am. Enquiries are going, however the death is currently being treated as unexplained. A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.”

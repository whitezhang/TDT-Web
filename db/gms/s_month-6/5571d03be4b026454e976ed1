A LABOUR MSP was left red-faced after she described herself as a prostitute on social media following a punctuation blunder.
Rhoda Grant, the Highlands and Islands MSP, had meant to share an article with her 1300 followers when she committed the error.
The online story featured a former call girl in Northern Ireland welcoming new laws that would banning paying for sex.
 
As a former prostitute, it feels wonderful that there are now places where I could not legally be for sale http://t.co/joGzBylfH1

Ms Grant retweeted the headline which said: “As a former prostitute, it feels wonderful that there are now places where I could not legally be for sale.”
But because Grant did not include quotation marks, it appeared she was making the claim herself.
The Twitter faux pas led to friends and other posters having a bit of fun.
One wrote ‘Brave of you to come out in public like this’, while another posted: &quot;Congratulations. Inspiring to know that a fallen woman can make it into politics.”

THE desperate family of a Glasgow dad who died suddenly in Australia are appealing for help to fly his body home.Gary Gordon, 44, passed away on Saturday morning.His body was discovered by his wife Traceyann, 42, and their three-year-old son Daniel.The family now face a bill of around &pound;15,000 to bring Gary, Tracyann and Daniel home to Scotland.Celtic-fan Gary, who was born and raised in Glasgow, moved to Australia five years from Dundee with his wife.The family moved to a new home just outside Melbourne, in the suburb of Frankston, on Friday.On Saturday morning Gary complained of chest pain and decided to go for a nap.When his son went tried to waken him an hour later, at around 10am, he was unresponsive.Gary's step daughter daughter Sinead Campbell, 23, who lives in Dundee, told the Evening Times: &quot;Daniel was jumping on the bed then he shouted to my mum 'Daddy wont waken up'.&quot;My mum phoned for an ambulance and performed CPR until they arrived.&quot;They worked on him for 25 minutes but he was gone.&quot;Sinead added: &quot;I called Gary dad because he was my dad. And he treated me like his daughter.&quot;I cant describe how devastated we all are - I need to get them home to us.&quot;I feel like I cant even begin to grieve until Gary is home.&quot;The family are waiting for the results of a post mortem examination to determine Gary's cause of death.After leaving Glasgow, Gary lived in cities across England - including Manchester, Leeds and Carlisle - before settling in Dundee with Traceyann.The couple married in 2008 at Gretna Green.Sinead said: &quot;My dad used to tell me stories about the Gorbals - he still has friends and family ties in the city.&quot;I used to slag him for being a 'weegie' with an English accent.&quot;She added: &quot;He was such a lovely, kind man.&quot;I cant believe he is gone.&quot;An online appeal has been launched to bring Gary home to Scotland so that he can be laid to rest in Dundee. Over &pound;7,000 in donations has so far been raised.Gary, is a trained electrician, was working as a driver for social services in Australia and Traceyann is a social worker.Family friend Trudy Gill, who has launched the appeal, said: &quot;Gary was an amazing man.&quot;Due to the recent house move and family circumstances there is no savings or life insurance to pay for Gary's and his family's return.&quot;I am trying to do whatever I can to help my dear friend and bring the family home so that Gary can be laid to rest in Scotland.&quot;To donate money visit www.fundrazr.com and search &quot;Please help to bring Gary and his family home&quot;.

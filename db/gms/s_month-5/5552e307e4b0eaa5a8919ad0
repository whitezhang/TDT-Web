DOZENS of used syringes were discovered in a Glasgow toilet block in just over a week.A total of 43 syringes were found in the 24 hour-loos, in Stevenson Street West, at the Barras, from May 1 until Monday, new figures reveal.The toilets are owned by Glasgow City Council and run by public toilet management firm Healthmatic.The company operates about six toilet blocks in the west of Scotland, including in St Vincent Street and West Campbell Street, and 300 throughout the UK.Managing director Roger Berry said drug addicts using in Glasgow toilets was a huge problem that needed to be addressed.Syringes are used to inject heroin, and sometimes crack cocaine. They can also be used to inject steroids.The Evening Times was shown used needles containing blood by Healthmatic staff.It came after a member of the public reported finding nine used syringes in the Stevenson Street West public conveniences on Sunday.The man complained of finding spots of blood in the loo.A Glasgow City Council spokesman said they were alerted to the mess and went out to clean it immediately.The following day 12 syringes in total were found in the same block by cleaning staff.Mr Berry said the the block had become a hot spot for addicts.He said the toilets in St Vincent Street were formerly an issue but policing in the City Centre had deterred drug users.He added: &quot;We keep a needle count because it is a very big problem in Glasgow as well as other big cities.&quot;Our cleaners are regularly having to deal with it and it's very unfortunate that members of the public have come across them too.&quot;Mr Berry said they were looking into ways to discourage people from dumping used needles. They are considering changing the opening and closing times of individual toilets.The Healthmatic workers are also having to dispose of other drug paraphernalia, as well as empty bottles of alcohol and used condoms.Robert Smith, service engineer, said prostitution was a problem.He added: &quot;We have cleaners out three times a day and the toilets automatically clean themselves after use.&quot;But we can't be there all the time.&quot;Mr Berry suggested that authorities could look into options such as a needle exchange unit or drug centre.He said: &quot;There is a system like that in Brighton. It might help to stop people from injecting in public places.&quot;

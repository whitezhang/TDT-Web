A COUPLE who won more than &pound;186,000 in a EuroMillions draw are planning their first trip abroad.
Robert and Anita Reid didn’t have passports before they struck lucky. But now they are heading to the States.
Home carer Anita, 57, said: “Neither of us has ever been abroad, so I think a long overdue trip to New York is on the cards.
“Robert has always wanted to go – I’m so happy that I can treat both of us.
“This money is going to make such a difference to our lives.
“We’re going to pay off our mortgage and get a new car.”
Anita, of Blantyre, always buys three lucky dips on Tuesdays for EuroMillions. She couldn’t believe it when her numbers came up.
 

She said: “I sat in the living room and checked my numbers as usual, to see whether I’d won anything.
“I thought, ‘Oh, I’ve got one number, two, then three, four, five and a lucky star number’.
“I ran to wake Robert, who thought the house was on fire because I woke him in such a rush. After we had both double-checked the numbers together, I phoned the National Lottery and they confirmed it was a winner.”
Anita, who has a daughter, Cheryl, 33, and son, Robert, 30, added: “The first thing we did was have a Diet Coke to celebrate.”

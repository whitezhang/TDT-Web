A DAD says he owes his life to an optician who spotted he’d had a stroke – after two doctors and a nurse claimed it was a migraine.
Stuart McCormack, 36, from Arbroath, thought he was suffering from a migraine at a friend’s wedding on March 28.
A nurse at the bash thought that was the most likely diagnosis but told him to see a GP if the symptoms persisted.
The next day, with his sight still not back in his left eye, his wife Leeanne phoned an out of hours GP, who also thought it was a migraine but suggested he see his own GP.
She, too, believed it was a migraine but booked Stuart in for blood tests and told him to visit an optician in case an eye condition was causing the problem.
But Specsavers optometrist Marc Funai recommended he go to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, where a CT scan confirmed he had suffered a stroke.
 


As May is Stroke Awareness Month, the aircraft engineer is keen to raise awareness of his experience.
Married Stuart, dad to Shay, four, said: “It was just completely out of the blue. Often if someone has a stroke they can have another one within a month.
“That didn’t happen to me because Marc was so thorough and realised something was not right.
“To be told I had suffered a stroke was a shock.”
Stuart was monitored in hospital for a couple of days before being allowed home with medication on which he will probably remain for the rest of his life.
He said: “Marc’s professionalism probably saved my life.”

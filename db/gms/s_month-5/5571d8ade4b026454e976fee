A MASSIVE fundraising appeal has been launched for a family who lost their home and beloved pets in a fire.
Garry Betts discovered his Edinburgh house had been destroyed after a blaze took hold on Thursday. &shy;Firefighters spent six hours putting it out.
Border collie Buster and the family’s two cats were killed and all the family’s belongings were destroyed.
 Local football team Spartans FC have launched an appeal to help Garry and his family in their hour  of need. 
 

The Lowland Football League side put &pound;500 in &shy;themselves and the total raised was last night already above &pound;3000.
Garry, known as Grim to his friends, said he was &shy;overwhelmed by the support shown to him just hours after tragedy struck.
He said: “Words fail me. I always believed in the &shy;Spartans family but seeing it in action for us is unbelieveable.
“They are all the light at the end of a very dark tunnel.
 

“I’ve cried as much over the oustanding &shy;kindness shown to us as much as I have over the loss of our Buster and the cats.
“I’ve had everyone from the club chairman Craig Graham, the manager Douglas Samuel and all the players getting in touch with me.
“Even folk from beyond the family, the folk from other teams have all offered their support. I’m truly grateful to them all.”
 Garry, 52, had been on his way home from coaching at the Spartan Academy when he noticed a fire in  his street. 
But it was only when he got close enough did he realise it was his house on Crewe Terrace that had gone up in flames. The cause is not yet known.
 A Spartans spokesman said: “Grim and his family have lost all of their &shy;possessions including  his wonderful dog Buster and their cats. 
“He has given up so much to help a large number of people within the North Edinburgh &shy;community.
“Our thoughts are with Grim and his family.”

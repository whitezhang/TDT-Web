AARON SUMMERS admits Glasgow Tigers only have themselves to blame for gifting away three points at Newcastle.
The Ashfield side blew a lead against depleted Diamonds outfit as they lost out 46-43 to the home team.
Glasgow earned one Premier League point for a defeat of fewer than seven points when they should - according to Summers - have had all four.
He said: &quot;It's definitely points dropped. I didn't ride as well as I wanted to. Newcastle were quick and the track caught us out a little bit.
&quot;It was just a tough night for us. It shouldn't have happened - we should have had all the points.
&quot;We're sorry for our performance. I'm pretty ashamed of the way I rode and I'm sure some of the other boys are as well.
&quot;I don't know if some of the track conditions put us off, but it fell apart half-way through. We weren't making starts either which didn't help.&quot;
The Aussie is determined to bounce back from the setback and insists having a point banked was better than walking away for nothing as they aim to challenge for the title this season.
He said: &quot;One point is better than nothing - it might just get us over the line when we need it. It's just a shame it wasn't the full three.
&quot;We'll just put it behind us and we'll go onto the next one.&quot;
Glasgow now have a week off from league action before they face Sheffield and Plymouth away from home, then Scunthorpe visit the Peugeot Ashfield Stadium on June 7.

COUNCIL bosses have come under fire for refusing to back a planning decision in a supermarket row.As the Evening Times reported in April, the Co-operative is challenging a decision to allow Aldi to build a store in Drumchapel, which was due to create up to 40 jobs.Bargain chain Aldi was given permission by the council last December to construct a 17,000 sq ft shop in Duntreath Avenue.However, Co-operative Estates, owner of Drumchapel Shopping Centre, said it was in &quot;active&quot; negotiations with Lidl to open a branch within the shopping hub.The Co-op is taking legal action against the council over the planning committee decision.It has now emerged that Glasgow City Council will not be defending the planning decision made.A council spokesman said: &quot;The planning officer had recommended the refusal of planning permission, due to the site being outwith Drumchapel town centre and so contrary to the development plan.&quot;However the planning applications committee, as an independent body, made the decision to grant consent.&quot;As the council will not be defending the Petition, the application will therefore be made live again and will be reconsidered by the planning applications committee in due course.&quot;Community leaders hit out at the move.Anniesland MSP Bill Kidd said: &quot;This sort of attitude being displayed by the Co-operative and the city council can potentially block competition and severely disadvantages my constituents.Mr Kidd said he welcomed the proposal to have an Aldi in Drumchapel &quot;He added: &quot;My constituents are being let down by the council and its bureaucracy yet again; they will not forget that this is the case.&quot;Councillor Malcolm Balfour said the decision means the whole process was likely to go &quot;right back to the start&quot;.He added: &quot;A consequence of that means a long delay in the opening of a much needed low cost supermarket in an area of social deprivation.&quot;It also results in the delay of the creation of 30 to 40 much needed jobs in an area of high unemployment.&quot;I remain committed to the introduction of a low cost retail unit in Drumchapel and would encourage both the city council and Aldi to work together to achieve this.&quot;Glasgow North West MP Carol Monaghan added that Aldi would bring &quot;much needed jobs to the area&quot;.A spokesman for The Co-operative Estates said they had not received any formal confirmation that that council was withdrawing from the Judicial Review process.He added: &quot;Accordingly, we will continue our preparation for the Court hearing, which is currently scheduled for 25-26th June.&quot;

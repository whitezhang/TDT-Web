 GLASGOW'S international centre Peter Horne collected the Warriors 'Players Player of the Year' award this week and then declared that Ulster's big names do not faze him. 
The versatile Glasgow star, who has fought back from serious injury and criticism on the Test stage, is developing into one of Scotland's most skilful rugby players and he will be a key weapon as Glasgow seek to repeat last week's win over Ulster in the Guinness PRO12 semi-final at a 10,000-capacity Scotstoun tonight.
However, Ulster played a near second-string side last week knowing they were likely to end up away to Glasgow in the play-offs and have made 11 changes for this week's return. The winner will reach a PRO12 final to be played at Ulster's Kingspan Stadium next Saturday.
 In this exclusive Daily Record Rugby Show, Horne tells us how the Warriors have been preparing, what he expects from this match and why he believes this Glasgow squad are better equipped to overcome Springbok Ruan Pienaar and the Ulster talents than any in the past.

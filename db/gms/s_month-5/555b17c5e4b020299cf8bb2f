THEY braved the weather in their thousands – and brightened the outlook for a rainbow of good causes.
Here are just a few of the hardy souls who completed the Morrisons Great Women’s 10k in Glasgow on Sunday.
Among those running were mum-of-two Jen Bremner, who is living with terminal cancer, and Arlene Clark, who set up Brightest Star in memory of her son Jack, who died at the age of five.
 

In all, thousands took part in the event to raise money for charity and here are some of the best pictures from the day.
An incredible 7000 runners took to the streets for the annual event, won by Gemma Rankin from Kilbarchan AAC, in Renfrewshire.
But for the huge majority of entrants, it was all about helping their chosen charity.

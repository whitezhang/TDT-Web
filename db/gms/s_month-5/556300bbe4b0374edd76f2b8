&quot;This is the worst fire Ive seen in multi-story and I think the cladding on the building is actually fuelling it.
&quot;The fire seemed catch the cladding and drip down to the flats below. It became more ferocious as it hit the cladding.
 

&quot;It's really scary, I used to stay at the Charles Street multi. There is one emergency stairwell and two lifts. This fire started in a two bed flat and I imagine some people may have been trapped in their homes because of the smoke.
&quot;There are lots of ambulances there at the moment.&quot;
The three residents suffered minor injuries including mild smoke inhalation and symptoms of shock.
They were treated at the scene by the Scottish Ambulance Service.

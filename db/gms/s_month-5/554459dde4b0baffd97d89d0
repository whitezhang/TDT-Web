HOMESICK Hollywood idol Gerard Butler has splashed out almost &pound;600,000 on a luxury bachelor pad.
The Paisley-born star has said he misses Scotland and spent months househunting in his homeland before choosing an upmarket flat in Glasgow’s south side.
Property records show Butler, 45, paid &pound;582,000 for the apartment near Eastwood Toll, Giffnock, and doesn’t have a mortgage on the home. He snapped it up just a few weeks after it was put on the market by its previous owners.

The flat has three bedrooms, a private balcony, drawing room and underfloor heating.
It is believed that Butler, who also has homes in LA and New York, plans to use it as his Scottish base for trips back home.
The star has said he longs to be home after travelling the world shooting films. He said: “I grew up loving being Scottish and have a real passion for home and family. That is the hardest thing about being an actor and living in LA.
“In this job – and I’m not complaining – there’s lots of moving around and not a lot of spare time to maintain the ties and closeness you have to family and close friends.

“I love living in LA, and Dubai and Australia, too. They are amazing places to spend time in and, in the short term, are exactly what I’m after but, in the end, I want to move back to Scotland – back to my roots.
“Whenever I go home, I always return to LA feeling more like myself, that little bit more bullish. Life in LA can be a bit soft. I like to come back with Scottish attitude.”
Former trainee lawyer Butler has been dating interior designer Morgan Brown for about eight months. There have been rumours they are engaged but Butler recently insisted he is still a “bachelor”.

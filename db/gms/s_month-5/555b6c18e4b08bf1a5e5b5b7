SCOTLAND has launched a world first by agreeing across all sports a set of guidelines for dealing with concussion.
Brain damage caused by concussion has become a major issue in world sport and topped the headlines last month when a US court agreed to a $900m lawsuit against the NFL which will force the American Football chiefs to pay out to all injured footballers over the next 65 years. This was due to an acceptance that concussion had been swept under the carpet in recent decades and not properly treated.
World rugby became a laughing stock as it allowed clearly concussed players to return to the field and former Scotland rugby winger Rory Lamont spoke out two years ago and revealed that international players were cheating concussion tests in a misguided effort to ensure concussion would go undetected during the season.
Lamont has worked closely with leading neuropathologist Dr Willie Stewart, from the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow, after his studies uncovered a direct link between concussion in rugby players and early onset dementia.
 

Scotland was already well served by Dr James Robson, the SRU's Chief Medical Officer, who has been campaigning for better treatment of concussion in rugby for the past decade and is at the forefront of a culture change in world sport.
 In this week's Daily Record Rugby Show, David Ferguson catches up with Dr Robson as his campaign reaches a tangible result with a new set of guidelines agreed by over 50 sporting organisations in Scotland that aim to stop players of all ages and at all levels returning to the field with concussion.
He hopes that they will also provide a positive legacy from the death of 14-year-old rugby player in Ireland Ben Robinson, who suffered fatal head injuries after being allowed to play on despite suffering concussions in a schools rugby match in Ireland. 
His father Peter joined the Scottish Government, SRU, SFA and others governing bodies to launch the new guidelines as well as Dr Andrew Murray, the extreme runner and government adviser on physical activity, who also gave us his thoughts on the difference they will make in this exclusive video.

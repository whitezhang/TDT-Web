TRIBUTES have been paid to an eight-year-old boy who was killed after a gravestone fell on him while he was out playing with pals.Friends and neighbours told of their shock after Ciaran Williamson was hit by the gravestone in Craigton Cemetery, in Cardonald, on Tuesday night.As reported in later editions of last night's Evening Times, the youngster was rushed to Yorkhill hospital by paramedics but was pronounced dead a short time later.A 10-year-old boy remains in hospital following the tragedy, in a stable condition.Floral tributes and a Celtic shirt bearing the simple message 'RIP GBFN pal by TJ' were among the first to be left outside Ciaran's home in Moss Heights Avenue at the Moss View Heights tower blocks yesterday.The shirt was left by Ciaran's friend 10-year-old Thomas McManus, who was with him when the accident happened.Thomas, who was left with minor injuries, told how three other boys, aged seven, nine and 10, were with him and Ciaran when tragedy struck.He said they had managed to get into the cemetery through a large hole in the back wall which backs onto the flats.Thomas, who has known Ciaran for around four years, said: &quot;Within 10 seconds it had happened.&quot;We went through the hole and there was a tree right there.&quot;We climbed up it and we were jumping off it. The gravestone underneath started shaking and it fell down. It hit Ciaran in the face.&quot;Thomas - known as TJ - said he tried to grab Ciaran out of the way but it was too late.He said: &quot;We dived out of the way.&quot;The top part of it - a triangle - hit him on the head. He got crushed.&quot;He said the boys often played in the graveyard.He added: &quot;If I knew that was going to happen I would never have gone in.&quot;Ciaran was knocked out.&quot;He ran to fetch Ciaran's mum, Stephanie, and stepdad Thomas and an ambulance was called.Thomas and two of the other boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said Ciaran was known by everyone on the estate.They described him as &quot;just a normal boy&quot; who loved Celtic and hanging out with his mates.Thomas said he had a sister and brother, aged two and four, and a 10-month-old brother.Posting on Facebook, Ciaran's dad Ryan said: &quot;My boy this is not good bye becos [sic] I'll see you again soon buddy I love you to moon and back and not a second of a day that goes bye will I not miss you but your memory will [be] in our hearts forever.&quot;We will never stop speaking about you so until we meet again wee man you sleep tight and remember dad loves and misses you more than words can describe.&quot;First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described it as &quot;heartbreaking&quot; on Twitter and wrote: &quot;My deepest condolences to Ciaran's family and friends.&quot;Ciaran's headteacher Maureen Simpson, of Lourdes Primary School, said: &quot;This is a tragic incident and our thoughts and prayers are with Ciaran's family and friends at this time.&quot;This is a shock to our school community and we will do all that we can to support pupils and staff through this difficult period. Ciaran was a popular pupil and will be missed by us all.&quot;Bunches of flowers were laid outside the tower blocks with messages of support for his family. One simply read &quot;Thinking of you&quot; and another said &quot;You will always be missed.&quot;Ciaran's cousin Daniella Nicole Hainey posted a message on Facebook which read: &quot;We are all will missing you love you wee cousin RIP.&quot;Ciaran's aunt declined to comment, telling the Evening Times: &quot;It is a tragic, tragic time. We just can't understand it.&quot;An official statement released from the family through Police Scotland later yesterday said: &quot;We would like to take this opportunity to inform you that our son Ciaran James Williamson sadly passed away in a tragic accident at Craigton Crematorium.&quot;We would respectfully ask that you respect our privacy at this distressing time.&quot;

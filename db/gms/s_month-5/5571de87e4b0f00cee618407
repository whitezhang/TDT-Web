A STUNNED motorist spotted a cockerel waiting at a bus stop.
And the Good Samaritan pulled over a drove the runaway rooster to an animal charity rescue centre.
Now the Scottish SPCA are trying to trace the owner of the bird they’ve since named Decker. A member of the public spotted the bird at a bus stop in Maryculter and took him to the Aberdeenshire Animal Rescue Centre in Drumoak.
Centre manager Graeme Innes said: “Decker is a handsome chap.
“He didn’t have a bus pass so it’s lucky a kind passer by stopped and gave him a lift to our centre.
“We don’t know how Decker came to be there. It’s possible he has strayed from home or he could have been abandoned.
“Although he appears confident, he can be a little nervous and isn’t used to being handled. “He does like to show off in front of all the females though.
“Decker will require a safe area to explore during the day and a secure place to stay overnight.
“We think he would enjoy a place in the countryside.”
Anyone able to offer Decker a ticket to his forever home is urged to call 03000 999 999.

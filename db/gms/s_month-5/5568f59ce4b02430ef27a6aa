 Scottish champions Glasgow City have signed Republic of Ireland striker Clare Shine from Raheny United after the 20-year-old sparkled on trial. 
 Head coach Eddie Wolecki Black is rebuilding his side having losing Scotland midfielder Suzanne Lappin to retirement. 
 Shine has just recovered from a leg break suffered last year. 
 &quot;There is no doubt she has talent and will score goals for City - of that I am certain,&quot; said Black. 
 &quot;It's evident that someone so young who has overcome a long-term injury clearly has an inner determination to succeed.&quot; 
 Shine joins fellow Ireland forward Denise O'Sullivan at City.

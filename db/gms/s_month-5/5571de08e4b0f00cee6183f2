THE man at the centre of a police probe into underage sex at a house party in Edinburgh has been released from custody.
The 18-year-old man was freed by police pending further inquiries into claims he committed a sex act with a 15-year-old girl while revellers at a party filmed the scene on their mobile phones.
Detectives launched an inquiry after the Daily Record revealed the explicit video was being shared on social media , with two prominent local sportsmen also at the party.
Police said they are still looking for the people who filmed the incident, which happened at a sports party attended by a footballer and a boxer on Saturday night.
The footballer and boxer have not been named by the Record as we understand they were not involved in any illegal activity.
A Crown Office spokesman said: “The Procurator Fiscal at Edinburgh received a report concerning an 18-year-old male in connection with an incident said to have occurred in Edinburgh on 3 May 2015.
“After full and careful consideration of the report, the accused was liberated from custody and did not appear in court in respect of this incident.
“The case remains under consideration by the Procurator Fiscal.”

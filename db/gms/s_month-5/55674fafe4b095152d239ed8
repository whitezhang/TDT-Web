EuroMillions Lottery winners Colin and Chris Weir donated &pound;1m to the SNP in the run-up to the general election.
New figures from the Electoral Commission for the first three months of this year show that they gifted &pound;500,000 each to the party.
In total, the couple, from Largs, Ayrshire, have given the SNP &pound;3m since they won &pound;161m on the Lottery in 2011.
The SNP received a total of &pound;1,055,250 in donations between January and March 2015.
In addition, the party also received public finding of &pound;48,659 from the House of Commons' &quot;short money&quot; fund, which is given to opposition parties to help with their costs.
Elsewhere, political parties across the UK received a total of just over &pound;30m in donations in the first three months of 2015. Of that, more than half was gifted to the Conservative Party, with more than &pound;9m being donated to Labour.
An SNP spokeswoman said: &quot;We thank all of our donors - big and small - for contributing to the success of the party, including the historic events at the general election and consistently being ahead in the polls after eight years in government, which is a remarkable achievement.&quot;
Mr and Mrs Weir, who have described themselves as being &quot;lifelong supporters of independence&quot;, gifted the SNP &pound;1m in September 2011 following their lottery win and a further &pound;1m in February last year. They also provided &pound;3.5m in funding for the &quot;Yes&quot; campaign, prior to the Scottish independence referendum.
In addition to their support for the SNP, the Weirs have used their fortune to fund a number of good causes, including buying a 13-year-old boy a prosthetic leg, and they have established a charitable trust to help fund health, sport, cultural, recreational and animal welfare projects.

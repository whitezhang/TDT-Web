A FRIEND of one of the men accused of a murder plot against former Loyalist leader Johnny "Mad Dog' Adair has told a jury police wanted him to turn informer.Seamus Flynn, 30, bar manager at the Brazen Head in Glasgow, was giving evidence at the trial of Antoin Duffy, 39, Martin Hughes, 36, Paul Sands, 31 and Gorman, 58.They deny conspiring to murder Mr Adair and Sam &quot;Skelly&quot; McCrory - once high profile figures in the loyalist organisation, the UDA, and its military wing the Ulster Freedom Fighters.Mr Flynn, who is a friend of Duffy, was questioned by police on October 24, 2013 - the day after Duffy and others were detained.The jury heard that police surveillance teams had spotted the two men meeting each other.Duffy's house was also bugged and Duffy was heard making reference to someone called Seamus.Mr Flynn told advocate depute Paul Kearney, prosecuting: &quot;The police said : 'We can give you money and a new life '.&quot;He claimed this was before they interviewed him on tape.He added: &quot;I didn't want to give them a statement. I didn't want to be there.&quot;Mr Kearney said: &quot;What else did they say,&quot; and Mr Flynn replied: &quot;They said: ' Are you okay for money,' and I said: 'I'm fine for money.'&quot;The prosecutor told Mr Flynn: &quot;You have misrepresented this exchange about money,&quot; and he replied: &quot;Definitely not.&quot;Mr Flynn, originally from Belfast, told the court his father was a member of Sinn Fein, but said he had no Republican sympathies.Under cross-examination by defence QC Derek Ogg, representing Duffy, Mr Flynn agreed that in 2013 Duffy was often drunk and taking Tramadol.Mr Ogg said: &quot;He was behaving outrageously,&quot; and Mr Flynn replied: &quot;He was always off his head shouting and roaring.&quot;Duffy and Gorman also deny being part of a plan to murder the governor of Barlinnie jail Derek McGill in a car bomb attack.Three other men - Craig Convery, 37, Gary Convery, 34, and Brown, 29, - deny organised crime charges.The trial before judge Lady Scott continues.

A PROBE has been launched into reports that two planes flew UNDER the Kessock Bridge in a stunt many will recognise from the video game Grand Theft Auto V.
A member of the public contacted police to say the aircraft had performed the daredevil stunt shortly after 1pm on Tuesday.
A third plane was also said to be involved but didn't fly under the bridge.
A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Police in Inverness received a report from a member of the public regarding an incident of possible unofficial aeronautical acrobatics when three planes were seen flying past the Kessock Bridge.
 

“Two of the planes were reported as having flown beneath the bridge before meeting up with the third plane and continuing on their flight path.
“Enquiries are ongoing into the matter at this time and the facts have been reported to the Civil Aviation Authority.”
Police have asked anyone has anyone with information to contact them on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

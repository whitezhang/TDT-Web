SCOTLAND’S favourite rescue dog is the poster boy for a new campaign encouraging families to take on a homeless pet.
Shar-pei crossbreed Kai – who was found at Ayr railway station in February – and new owner Ian Russell , from Newton Mearns, Glasgow, are spearheading the Scottish SPCA’s rehoming week appeal.
Ian, 52, said: “Kai has settled in amazingly well with me – he is one relaxed and chilled dog.

“I didn’t just want Kai because he had been in the news, I wanted to help a rescued animal in need of a second chance.”
The promotional week is aimed at rehoming hundreds of animals in need.
SSPCA spokesman Mike Flynn added: “Many people might not realise we rehome many animals, from dogs, cats, rabbits and rodents to horses, birds, snakes and more.”

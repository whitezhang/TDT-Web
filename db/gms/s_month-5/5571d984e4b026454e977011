 TENNENT'S Lager claims it’s profits have been hit by the new drink driving limit. 
 Tennent’s owner C&amp;C Group is the latest drinks company to report an impact from the Scottish Governments decision to lower the limit from 50mg of alcohol per 100ml from 80mg. 
Chief Executive of the C&amp;C Group Stephen Glancey said the company had no objections to Government’s decision recognising it was based on social responsibilty .
But it said sales, especially in rural areas and in venues like gold clubs had been the most affected.
The company is in a robust state with profits up by 1.8 per cent to &pound;29 million but Mr Glancey said they would have been better without the new limit.
 He believes the impact is short term and like the smoking ban, drinkers would learn how to adjust to the new limit . 
Mr Glancey said: ”We are finding that over the last month or two people are going back to drinking. They are not going back to illegal drink driving but the fear factor in terms of the impact the next day has maybe dissipated a little. We don’t see it as being a big drag on our earnings to be honest.”

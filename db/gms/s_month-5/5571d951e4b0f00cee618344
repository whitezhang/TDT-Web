THE family of a murdered Scots police officer &shy;discovered one of his killers has made a fresh bid for freedom – from a Google internet search.
Drug dealer Mohammed Hirsi stabbed Paul Fyfe, 47, to death in Leicester in 2011, as his pal Ameen Jogee egged him on.
Both thugs were convicted of joint enterprise – an English law which allows everyone involved in a crime to be charged no matter who struck the killer blow. They received life sentences.
 

Relatives of war veteran Paul, &shy;originally from &shy;Aberdeen, weren’t officially informed of Jogee’s appeal – the third time he has made a bid for freedom. To compound his widow Tracey’s agony, their daughter Tara, 30, found out about the bid – after the appeal had been allowed – on the internet.
Tara’s sister Emma, 27, said: “She had been searching through the internet and just came across it. We were shocked and disgusted.” If the Supreme Court appeal is successful, it could lead to a change in the law.
 

Tracey, 52, said: “I am very angry. I don’t think people understand how important the law of joint enterprise is.
“If it is changed, it will literally mean dangerous people getting away with murder.”

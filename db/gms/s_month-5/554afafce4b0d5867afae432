THOUSANDS of pounds worth of drugs and fake goods have been seized from organised crime gangs in Lanarkshire during a three-month crackdown by police.Officers said the haul included hundreds of counterfeit football tops worth &pound;29,000, &quot;illicitly obtained music&quot; worth &pound;100,000 and &pound;9,000 worth of drugs.The total value of fake goods taken off the streets by police topped &pound;170,000 during a pilot project which saw the force team up with trading standards.A trading standards officer from North Lanarkshire Council was attached to Police Scotland's Lanarkshire Division between December 2014 and February this year.Police said the team also worked with South Lanarkshire Council, the Federation Against Copyright Theft (FACT) and the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) to target &quot;serious and organised criminals&quot;.The pilot project also led to a 72% reduction in metal thefts, following equipment checks carried out on licensed metal dealers, the seizure of counterfeit tobacco and the recovery of &pound;18,000 worth of counterfeit goods from a business connected to serious and organised crime.Inspector Andrew Thomson, of Police Scotland's Lanarkshire Division, said: &quot;Tackling serious and organised crime is a priority for Police Scotland and we were happy to pilot this scheme to show how joint working can really impact on our ongoing commitment to reduce the threat and harm that it poses to our local communities.&quot;The support of our partner agencies was crucial in the planning of this initiative, and it has been a fantastic opportunity for my officers to work with trading standards on a daily basis to gather intelligence, carry out joint operations and share good practice. I am delighted with the results of the pilot.Paul Bannister, trading standards manager at North Lanarkshire Council, added: &quot;The success of this operation demonstrates the effectiveness of working together by delivering on one of our key community safety partnership outcomes, reducing the harm caused to communities by organised crime groups.&quot;There are no current plans to repeat the partnership project but police have vowed to continue their crackdown.Inspector Andrew Thomson added: &quot;Although the pilot has ended, we are as determined as ever to keep up the pressure on those who commit and fund criminality. No one is untouchable, if you are bringing misery into our communities, we will come after you.&quot;Anyone with information on serious and organised crime in their communities should call Police Scotland on 101 or Crimestoppers can be contacted anonymously by calling 0800 555 111.

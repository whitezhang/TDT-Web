POLICE are investigating allegations of electoral fraud at four Scottish polling stations.
In Glasgow officers are probing claims someone entered a polling station in the city’s East constituency and crossed a ballot paper under another person’s name.
Counting staff were told to be on the lookout for the paper when the box arrives at the Emirates Arena count.
In Edinburgh two polling stations are being investigated - South-side community centre and Gorgie and Dalry.
Meanwhile in North Lanarkshire returning officer Gavin Whitefield revealed electoral fraud could have been committed at a fourth location.

He said: “Following an allegation of personation at a polling station in the Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East constituency, the police are investigating.
“We will verify the ballot box in question in isolation to help to provide evidence for the police enquiry.
“No other polling stations or ballot boxes are affected.”
A City of Edinburgh Council spokeswoman confirmed concerns raised by polling staff had been reported to the police.
She said: &quot;Polling staff raised concerns over two possible cases of voter personation. This was immediately reported to Police Scotland who are now investigating.&quot;

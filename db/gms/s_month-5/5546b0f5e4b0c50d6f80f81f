GLASGOW is set to enjoy a sunny Bank Holiday Monday.But the good weather is not expected to last as the rest of the week is predicted to be a washout.Forecaster Tony Conlan, of Meteogroup, the weather arm of the Press Association, said the Monday would be a day to enjoy outdoors.He said: &quot;I know the general view is that Bank Holiday Mondays are always rainy and dull but this one is going to be quite a nice day.&quot;There might be some lingering overnight rain but the day itself will be one of sunshine and temperatures as high as 14 degrees.&quot;Not a bad day at all.&quot;Many Scots have already had to dig out their umbrellas as rain swept through large swathes of the country yesterday and Saturday.After a brief spell of sunshine on Tuesday, the week returned to late winter gloom and will stay that way from next Tuesday onwards.Mr Conlan added: &quot;It's going to be pretty woeful for much of the rest of the week.&quot;You can expect cloudy weather and heavy rain for Tuesday. Wednesday will be very windy and wet throughout most of the day.&quot;Thursday will be slightly better but still quite windy and things will ease off a little bit on Friday, although it will still be very cloudy.&quot;Temperatures will stay around the 11 and 12 degree mark, rising to 13 degrees on Friday.&quot;If there is any sunshine it will be joined by strong winds.&quot;

NOTORIOUS troll Katie Hopkins has been cleared by cops over a vile Twitter rant about Scotland's ebola scare. 
The former Apprentice star sparked outrage when she posted a series of messages online accusing &quot;sweaty jocks&quot; of sending &quot;Ebola bombs&quot; to England. 
She said: &quot;Sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glasgwegians just isn't cricket.&quot; And she added: &quot;Glasgwegian ebola patient move to London's Royal Free Hospital. Not so independent when it matters most are we jocksville?&quot; 

Her comments sparked a Police Scotland probe amid a public outcry. 
But officers found no evidence of criminality following an investigation. 
More than 20,000 people signed the petition calling for Hopkins to be arrested for her outburst.

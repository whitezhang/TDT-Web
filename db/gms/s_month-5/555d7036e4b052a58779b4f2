BANK bosses are closing a branch in a Glasgow community and expecting customers to travel outside the city to the nearest alternative.Clydesdale Bank is to close its Springburn branch and is telling customers to use the branch in Bishopbriggs, more than a mile and a half walk away.The branch will close in August and the decision has provoked anger in the area.Clydesdale Bank said the closure was necessary due to fewer people using branches and more customers using technology.It offers mobile phone banking, internet banking and the branch 1.6 miles away as alternatives.But Springburn is a community with low car ownership, and low internet access compared to Bishopbriggs which remains openPatricia Ferguson Maryhill and Springburn MSP said the decision is unfair on older people and those without cars and said it will impact on plans to improve the area.She has urged the bank to reconsider its closure plan.Ms Ferguson has written to the Clydesdale bank and said: It is interesting that you are not proposing to close the Bishopbriggs branch or expecting customers there to make the journey to Springburn.&quot;It seems that the most vulnerable of our communities will always be the ones who suffer when decisions like this are made.&quot;This seems to me to be a very short sighted decision in terms of the future business of the bank as I think that you will find that existing Clydesdale Bank customers will simply move their accounts to the TSB which still has a presence on Springburn Way.&quot;She said discussions with local businesses have been ongoing over how to improve the Springburn Way area and feels a recognisable name like the Clydesdale moving out will hamper the ambitions.As a result of changes in the way people bank, the number of customers using branches is falling year-on-year, while those using new technology continues to increase. With these factors in mind, the Bank has reviewed its network, and the branch on Springburn Way will close on 14th August.Steve Fletcher, head of branch network, Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banks, said:&quot;We understand customers will be disappointed by this news, but hope that the proximity of the Post Office, and the ever increasing range of alternative ways they can bank with us will minimise any impacts.&quot;These are not decisions we take lightly but we must adapt to the changing ways people choose to bank in order to deliver the services they want in the ways they want them. Our branches remain at the heart of what we do; we are re-investing, relocating and refurbishing to deliver better, modern branches for customers.&quot;

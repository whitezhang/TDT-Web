Police Scotland are to investigate a suspected case of voter fraud in Glasgow.
One ballot paper is to be handed over to police in the Glasgow East count centre as ballot boxes arrive.
It is believed that staff know the number of the affected paper and are aware which ballot box it is in.
Only one paper is reported to be involved.
Police Scotland were informed earlier today after two voters gave the same name and address at a Glasgow East polling station.
The ballot paper involved will be taken away from the count centre for investigation.
It comes after 10 counts of electoral fraud were reported in Glasgow in the Scottish independence referendum in September.
Voters are not currently required to present identification at Scottish polling stations and are identified by their name and address only.

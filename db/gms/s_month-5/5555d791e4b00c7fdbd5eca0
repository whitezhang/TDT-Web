Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has gone on trial in Scotland accused of perjury. 
The 47-year-old journalist is accused of lying at the trial of Scottish socialist politician Tommy Sheridan at the High Court in Glasgow in 2010.
Mr Coulson, from Kent, a former head of communications at Downing Street, has entered a plea of not guilty at the High Court in Edinburgh.
His trial, before judge Lord Burns, is expected to last four weeks. 
Mr Coulson, dressed in a grey suit, blue shirt and green tie, sat in the dock flanked by two security officers as the jury of nine men and six women was selected. 
He sat impassively as the three-page indictment was read to him. 
It claims he lied about knowing a journalist and private investigator employed by the News of the World who were involved in &quot;phone hacking&quot;.
Lord Burns told the jurors they must try the case solely on the evidence they heard from the witness box. 
He said it was probable they had heard about Tommy Sheridan and Andrew Coulson and formed views about them. 
But he said: &quot;It would be completely wrong to be influenced in any way by such views or opinions.&quot;

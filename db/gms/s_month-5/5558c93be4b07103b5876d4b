A MAN who died when a party in a Glasgow flat turned into a bloodbath has been named locally as Scott Gillies.
The 29-year-old, from the Bellahouston area of the city, died after violence flared in a flat above a pub in the Partick area of the city on Saturday morning.
Earlier today a 23-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death and is expected to appear in court tomorrow. Two others were injured in the incident.
Police and emergency services were called to the flat above the Dolphin Bar in Partick, shortly before 9am yesterday.
Neighbours said they saw a blood-soaked man flee from the property in Benalder Street.
 

Dolphin owner Stephen McBride told the Sunday Mail: “It’s been a terrible incident. I’ve been here five years and never have I heard any trouble from upstairs.
“I’ve been here since 9.40am this morning and I saw the ambulances. Police told me there had been an incident and I wasn’t allowed in my premises.
“After that, I told them about the CCTV outside the bar which I’ve now been informed is helping them with their enquiries.”

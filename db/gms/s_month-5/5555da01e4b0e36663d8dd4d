VANDALS have been warned they are risking lives after they destroyed safety signs and stole fencing from a reservoir site.The vandals struck at the Balgray reservoir in the Dams to Darnley Country Park, near Barrhead, and removed a sign from a pole and and set it on fire. Twenty five fence posts and some timber rails were also stolen.Scottish Water said the sign replaced one that had previously been thrown into the neighbouring Ryat Linn reservoir.A spokesman said new signs were installed last summer to warn people of the risks and that there had been deaths at reservoirs.Mark Maclaren, a team manager for Scottish Water, said: &quot;The signs are installed at our reservoirs because of the dangers and advise people that deaths have occurred at reservoirs and that they should be very careful when near them.&quot;We are very disappointed that one of our signs at Balgray reservoir has been vandalised and fencing stolen. It's not the first time a safety sign there has been vandalised and we would ask those responsible to stop doing this and call on anyone who witnesses such incidents to report them to the police.&quot;The signs are there to help save lives and the vandals' actions could put lives at risk so we hope those responsible for this damage stop immediately.&quot;

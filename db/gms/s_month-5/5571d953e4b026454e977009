DEVASTATED friends have led tributes to a young Celtic fan who passed away suddenly.
Kevin Haddow is understood to have died just hours after watching his heroes beat Aberdeen 1-0 at Pittodrie on Sunday.
The 23-year-old, from Balloch, Dunbartonshire, was a well-known figure at Parkhead and hundreds of tributes have been posted online.
Members of his Celtic Supporters bus are planning a banner tribute to be unveiled at tomorrow's game against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.
Celtic’s official fans liaison officer, John Paul Taylor, led the tributes online and said: “Sad to hear of the passing of Kevin Haddow recently, a great Celtic man, he’ll be missed by many. RIP Kevin.”
Childhood friend Connor Thomson wrote: “Kevin Haddow was one of my close pals for 13 years and it breaks my heart that he won’t wind me up again, I’ll miss the madness. Rip brother.”
It’s understood Kevin had recently moved into his own flat and had just returned from a stag weekend in Spain.
A source close to the family said: “Everyone is devastated. Kevin was a lovely lad. We cannot believe it and are still in shock.”

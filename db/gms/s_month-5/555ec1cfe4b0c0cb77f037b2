ANTI-SECTARIAN campaigners in Glasgow are celebrating after securing backing from one of the city's leading business groups.Nil by Mouth, founded by the current Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year, Cara Henderson, has been selected by Scottish Women in Business as its charity of the year.The partnership will include a series of events and fundraisers, and SWIB will also provide professional advice and support.The money raised will help fund Nil by Mouth's Champions for Change school programme.Representatives from NBM and SWIB joined pupils from St Blane's Primary School in Blantyre to announce the partnership.St Blane's was presented with its Gold Award, by Cara and SWIB Vice President Liz Taylor in recognition of its outstanding work challenging sectarianism.Nil by Mouth Campaign Director Dave Scott said: &quot;We are thrilled that Scottish Women in Business members chose us as their charity of the year.&quot;This year marks our 15th anniversary of challenging bigotry and working to bring people together.&quot;He added: &quot;SWIB's support will help fund our awardwinning schools programme and encourage young people to understand, rather than fear, difference.&quot;As the pupils from St Blane's prove, this will be the generation which defeats sectarianism once and for all.SWIB is a non-profit membership and networking group for business women with more than 120 members.Vice president Liz Taylor said: &quot;Each year our members nominate a charity that they feel is relevant and will benefit from our support.&quot;We are delighted to support NBM this year and in partnership with them we hope to improve awareness of the anti-sectarian projects they are involved in.&quot;Fundraising initiatives already completed this year included the group's SWIB Strolls, fun walks which encourage members and friends to sign up for a small fee which is donated to the charity.A team from SWIB also took part in the 5x50 Challenge, which encouraged members to commit to completing 5k of exercise every day for 50 days.The businesswomen ran, cycled, swam and walked as part of the project.Dave Scott added: &quot;Last year we worked with more than 5000 school pupils and it is this type of grassroots work that will help us create a Scotland free from bigotry.&quot;These women went above and beyond the call of duty and we are very grateful.&quot;

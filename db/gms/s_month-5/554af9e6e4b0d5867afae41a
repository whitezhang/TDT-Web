RUTH Davidson urged No voters to back her party and support the union during her final speech of the election campaign.The Scottish Conservatives leader called for unionists to take the same pride in voting Tory as they did in voting against independence in September last year.On the eve of polling day she said her party has a &quot;plan to keep Scotland at the heart of our United Kingdom&quot; and warned a deal between the SNP and Labour would divide the nation.Ms Davidson also blasted Nicola Sturgeon's concerns over the legitimacy of a UK government without Scottish voices, rejecting it as &quot;nonsense&quot;.She said: &quot;Here's the truth: Labour hate the SNP. The SNP loathes Labour.&quot;Nicola Sturgeon doesn't want to put Ed Miliband into No 10 because she believes in him - she wants to put Ed Miliband into No 10 because she believes in independence ... and a Labour Party in hock to the Nationalists brings independence closer than ever.&quot;It would be a joke if it wasn't a threat.&quot;Your family can't afford Labour. The country can't afford the SNP.&quot;We can't let this happen, we must not let this happen and tomorrow we'll get the chance to ensure it never happens.&quot;Turning to the referendum, Ms Davidson appealed to No supporters as she warned that every vote for the SNP is a &quot;vote that takes a step back towards another referendum&quot;.&quot;I want you to take the same pride in voting Scottish Conservative and Unionist on May 7 this year that you felt on September 18 last year,&quot; she said.&quot;I want you to cast your vote with the same conviction - knowing that you're doing the right thing for your country.&quot;A vote for the Scottish Conservatives is a vote for the union.&quot;Meanwhile Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish LibDems said his party were key to a stronger economy and fairer society in Britain during his final campaign speech.He said his party have acted as a &quot;moderating force for good&quot; over the last five years in Westminster, and added that they represented the whole of the UK.Mr Rennie continued: &quot;Only the Liberal Democrats hold the key to that positive path of economic recovery and fairness in society.&quot;Every single vote will count in securing the unity, stability and decency in our country's next government.&quot;The prize is impressive - a stronger economy and a fairer society, creating opportunity for all in society.&quot;In each of our eleven held seats and across Scotland, I urge people to look at our record, look at what we have achieved.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

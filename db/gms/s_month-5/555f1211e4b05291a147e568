Police are attempting to trace a man who attacked a 23-year-old woman while she was walking a dog in Girvan.
The victim was assaulted in the South Ayrshire town's Queens Drive, near Victory Park, at 12:10 on Thursday.
She was not badly hurt and managed to run back towards the Victory Park area.
The man was described as being white, in his late 40s, about 5ft 10in tall, of medium build and completely bald. He was wearing a light blue T-shirt and washed out blue jeans.
Det Con Billy Campbell, of Police Scotland, said: &quot;This was a very frightening experience for the young lady and thankfully she wasn't seriously hurt.
&quot;There would have been other dog walkers and people in the surrounding area at the time and I would appeal to anyone that recognises the man's description or saw anything suspicious to get in touch immediately.&quot;

Scotland's new Veterans Commissioner Eric Fraser has suggested the number of ex-service personnel who are homeless may be far higher than official statistics.The Falklands veteran who served in the Royal Navy for 37 years published his first report last month following his appointment in June 2014.Mr Fraser said: &quot;Although data collected in Scotland suggests that overall rates of homelessness among single veterans in Scotland, like the rest of the UK, may be falling, questions remain about the strength of the evidential base and I would suggest that further research is required.&quot;His main area of concern is &quot;the plight of Early Service Leavers (ESLs) who are recognised as especially vulnerable when they depart the armed forces&quot;.He said: &quot;Anecdotally, I have heard of widespread homelessness amongst this group with increasing numbers relying on friends and family to provide informal shelter and a temporary address... this phenomenon - often referred to as 'sofa surfing' - is a growing problem that may be hidden from officials and researchers.&quot;Mr Fraser recommended that the Scottish Government improves the provision of information and adapts public policy to reduce the risk of longer-term disadvantage to service leavers.He said: &quot;By shifting the emphasis to prevention, I am encouraging the Scottish Government and its partners to develop early interventions which can ease transition and prevent long-term problems.&quot;Some in the ex-service community will always need specific support to allow them to adjust to civilian life and it is essential that they get the help they require.&quot;But this must be balanced by promotion, to ensure that service leavers are seen as valued and valuable members of society, with an expectation that their outstanding skills and attributes can make a major contribution to Scotland's economy and its communities.&quot;Veterans Secretary Keith Brown welcomed the &quot;constructive suggestions&quot; in Mr Fraser's independent report entitled 'Transition in Scotland'.He said: &quot;Eric's independence allows him to hold us to account and identify in areas such as housing, employment and health where we can do more to help people leaving the military, and make Scotland an even more attractive location for those considering settling with their families in Scotland.&quot;

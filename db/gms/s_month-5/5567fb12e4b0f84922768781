COMMUTERS have joined the fight to feed Glasgow's hungry with a second mass foodbank collection at Glasgow Central Station.The station was flooded with donations when Network Rail first organised a drive in response to an appeal from Glasgow City Mission.The 12-hour collection in March last year attracted support from Glasgow comedian Kevin Bridges and saw nine-months worth of supplies collected.Station staff decided to appeal to rail passengers again to help the foodbank feed increasing number of people in need across the city.Volunteers manned a drop-off point in the centre of the station, next to the clock, from 7am to 7pm and and collected XX van loads of food and toiletries.One of those who donated was pensioner Stella McLeod who handed over a bag full of toiletries she bought from Boots in the station after spotting the appeal.The 78-year-old from Hamilton told the Evening Times: &quot;I have donated food in the past but hadn't thought about the need for toiletries.&quot;It is awful really that people can't afford the basics.&quot;I grew up during the war and we didn't have much but everybody was in the same boat.&quot;This just should be happening in this day and age.&quot;The collection was organised station officer Jim Frizzle.He said: &quot;The last time we held collection we were absolutely overwhelmed and we ended up with seven van loads of donations.&quot;We were not expecting as much this time around but it was always our plan to hold another collection for the City Mission.&quot;He added: &quot;We have been really humbled by the response.&quot;People have spotted us standing in the station in the morning, having not realised we were collecting today, and promised to bring donations at their lunch break or after work.&quot;Glasgow City Mission appealed for donations of tinned food, breakfast cereal, coffee, sugar, diluting juice and toiletries.City Mission volunteers were also collecting funds in the station yesterday.Mr Frizzle added: &quot;Over 100,000 people pass through Central Station every day so we are in a good position to help.&quot;

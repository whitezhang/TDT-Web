VILE loudmouth Katie Hopkins called for the death penalty for Nicola Sturgeon calling her a “short, ginger poison dwarf”.
She blasted the SNP leader during a new animated chat show saying she thought Sturgeon may be a terrorist.
Her outrageous slurs were broadcast on an online programme called Putin’s Lunchbox where an animation of the Russian leader interviews real guests.
 
She said: “Nicola Sturgeon is a short ginger poison dwarf. She might be a terrorist. Ginger people are not to be trusted. She should get the death penalty just for being ginger and being Scottish.”
The rent-a-gob also said ginger people, Scots generally and fat people deserved the death penalty.
She also blasted Wales and the Welsh.
She added: “I think in Wales, you have to be poor and able to sing harmonies in valleys.”

Hopkins recently mocked the First Minister and SNP candidate Alex Salmond on Twitter.
Hopkins labelled Salmond “Britain’s fattest man” as she expressed her urge to “thump” both politicians “in the face with a frying pan”.
Hopkins, who is already reviled in Scotland, tweeted: “Oh Nicola Sturgeon, the lines are mergin’, I want to thump Britain’s fattest man, &amp; you in the face with a frying pan.”

A SCOTS mum who was trapped inside a Nepalese monastery for over a week after the devastating earthquake has been rescued.
Ann Hardie was winched to safety on Saturday morning along with her hiking group after the Daily Record featured her plea for help.
The 47-year-old was on the trip of a lifetime, learning about meditation at the Nubri Monastery when disaster struck - leaving them stranded in the mountains with no way out.
On Friday, Ann warned that her group and around 100 monks were running dangerously low on food, had no heating or electricity and the situation was “critical”.

But son Graeme Hardie, 16, also from Kirkcaldy revealed on Saturday morning that his mum was safe.
Speaking to the Record, he said: “I just got off the phone to the monastery and Mum is in a helicopter right now. They got picked up ten minutes ago.”
The mother-of-two is expected to arrive home in the coming days.

 A PERVERT Children’s Panel chairman who abused boys he should have been helping was jailed for 12 years yesterday. 
 And one of Daniel Ross’s victims told the Record: “It’s a relief to see him finally get what he deserves. It’s been a long, long time coming.” 
Ross abused John Stewart, now a 42-year-old father of four, while chairman of Glasgow Children’s Panel in the 1980s. John says he was also “passed around” three or four of Ross’s friends in an ordeal that lasted two years.
 Another boy, 14 at the time, was abused for the first time by Ross in his office minutes before a Children’s Panel hearing to decide his future. 
Ross also abused a young man he met at a gay bar in the 1970s. He pled guilty to a total of six charges.
 At the High Court in Glasgow , Lord Matthews told him he had preyed on vulnerable boys when he should have been looking after their welfare.
 

He described the attacks as”very grave” and a “gross abuse of your position of trust”. 
Ross, who also served as a special constable, showed no emotion as he was led away in handcuffs.
John, of Glasgow, first reported Ross to police in 2001 but no charges were brought. He tried again after the Jimmy Savile scandal in 2012, and Ross was finally arrested.
 “There were times I really didn’t think justice was ever going to be done,” John admitted. “But the  judge told Ross exactly what he needed to hear. 
“I was worried he’d get a lighter sentence because the offences were a long time ago and he’s fairly old now. But 12 years is what he deserved, so I’m delighted.
 “Hopefully this will give others the confidence that if they go to police and tell the truth, ultimately they will see justice done .”

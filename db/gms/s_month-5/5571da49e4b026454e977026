A CHEF suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain after he was attacked by a footballer and his uncle, a court heard.
Steven Findlay, 45, had more than 22 staples inserted in his head and was kept in a hospital’s high dependency unit for five days.
Livingston defender Declan Gallagher, 24, and his uncle Anthony Murray, 29, deny assaulting Steven with an unknown third man to his severe injury and danger of his life.
It’s alleged they used a baseball bat or pole. Both men claim self-defence
Steven said trouble flared after he went to a party with his partner Marie Dockery, 47, in the Parkville Hotel in Blantyre, Lanarkshire, in April 2013.
Jurors at Hamilton Sheriff Court heard Steven was assaulted as he waited for a taxi outside after an earlier alleged attack on Marie.
Steven said he saw three men get out of a black BMW and that one took something from the boot.
He said: “The three of them headed straight towards me.
“Murray called me a baldy c**t and I replied, ‘Oh, it’s the guy who beat my wife up.’
“He came towards me as if to strike me so I put my hands up to defend myself but then I was struck from the side. I remember them surrounding me and getting a bang to the side of my head.
“I assume one of the others struck me with something heavy. I remember waking up on the floor and receiving a kick on the face.”
Steven claimed he lost his job as a head chef after taking long absences from work. He still gets headaches.
Gallagher, of Dundee, has also played for Clyde and Dundee.
Murray, of Blantyre, also denies assaulting Marie earlier in the evening. The trial continues.

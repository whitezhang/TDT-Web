A convicted sex offender who was found guilty of rape, indecent assault and abduction charges against three women has been jailed for eight years. 
Calan Morrison, 29, raped one woman at houses in Fernhill, Glasgow, and at Galston, East Ayrshire.
He indecently assaulted another woman in Clydebank and Elderslie and abducted two women who were left locked in a flat in Faifley, Clydebank. 
Morrison has a previous conviction for sex with an underage girl.
Jailing him at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Brailsford told Morrison: &quot;These offences were perpetrated against three individual ladies.&quot; 
The judge said it was noted that he had demonstrated &quot;minimal insight&quot; into the offences and the effect they may have had on victims. 
He ordered that Morrison should be kept under supervision for a further two years and placed him on the sex offenders register. 
During his trial, Morrison accused the women of lying.
One woman told the court how she was raped by him in 2014.
She told the jury: &quot;I said 'no' about 100 times. I don't see how that could be consensual.&quot; 
Another woman told the court how Morrison had grabbed her hair and forced her to perform a sex act.
One victim also said she was repeatedly locked in a flat by Morrison. 
&quot;I could never take the dog out for a walk,&quot; she said. 
&quot;There was electricity, but there was no heating. It was really cold.&quot;
The woman told the court how she managed to get out of the flat in 2005 after sending a text to an acquaintance and the door was eventually broken down. 
Another woman told Morrison's trial: &quot;I was constantly locked in the house. He constantly wasn't there. I sat in the flat with no heating and no hot water.&quot; 
The woman said that during the period in 2004 she was left feeling that her self-esteem had hit &quot;rock bottom&quot;.

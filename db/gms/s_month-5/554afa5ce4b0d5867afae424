THE two men bidding to be Prime Minister have ended their final full day of campaigning with a war of words with each warning the other poses a threat as the closest General Election campaign in decades draws to a close.With opinion polls all indicating a hung parliament again both David Cameron and Ed Miliband continued to insist they could win a majority and govern without the aid of others.Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, said he was &quot;not countenancing defeat and said the Tories were protecting the &quot;privileged few&quot;.Mr Cameron warned Labour and Mr Miliband were &quot;very dangerous&quot;.Mr Miliband attacked the Tories and LibDems as favouring the rich and protecting tax avoiders.He spent the final day campaigning in the north of England stating he would fight to the finish to prevent another five years of the Tory LibDem coalition government.He said: &quot;&quot;I'm going right up to the line, right down to the wire talking about the issues that matter to the British people, which is the NHS, their family finances, whether they can pay the bills at the end of the month, those bread-and-butter issues that matter most to the British people.&quot;&quot;We will abolish non-dom status. We have come to expect David Cameron and Nigel Farage defending the richest and most powerful.&quot;But don't forget that Nick Clegg is defending the non-dom rule as well.He said they offered a &quot;Tory plan where there is one rule for a few and another rule for everyone else.&quot;A second-term Tory government, propped up by the Lib Dems, that will raid your family budget, that will cut your NHS, that will continue to protect the privileged few.&quot;The Labour leader said he believed he would be Prime Minister but was now putting his fate in the hands of the electorate.He said: &quot;I'm optimistic, but it will be in the hands of the people come tomorrow and I know the people will make the right judgment.&quot;And, I hope people make a judgment on the basis of what's best for them and their family because I'm not just asking people to vote Labour, I'm asking people to vote to put their family first in this election.Mr Cameron spent the last day campaigning across England and Wales warning again of Ed Miliband relying on SNP support to be Prime Minister.He said Mr Miliband is a &quot;very dangerous&quot; person who is using a &quot;con trick&quot; to get into Downing Street.Mr Cameron said: &quot;I always thought this would be a very tough campaign, a very close campaign.&quot;This whole thing about a Labour government backed by the SNP in government people feel deeply uneasy about, because it would be a government held to ransom by a group of people that don't want the UK to succeed.&quot;Mr Cameron said he wanted Tory majority Government but didn't close the door on another coalition with the LibDems if he fails.He said: &quot;We hold 303 seats. We need another 23 in order to deliver that majority. I think that is the right answer for Britain. I think people want to see strong, decisive and frankly accountable government, where what's in your manifesto gets delivered, and there's still time for that to happen.&quot;However he said the coalition had provided strong stable government adding: &quot;I will always put the interests of the country first. That is what a prime minister should do, that is what I do.&quot;

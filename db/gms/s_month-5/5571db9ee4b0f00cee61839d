A SCOTS aid worker has spoken of the moment a second massive earthquake hit Napal.
UNICEF communications officer Rose Foley, from Glasgow, said people were forced to shelter under tables as the force of the 7.3 magnitude tremor caused buildings to shake and crumble around them.
She told Sky news: “Our earthquake alarm went off in the building and we dived under tables and the shaking seemed to go on and on.
“Everyone was very shaken up. We got out as quickly as we could.
“The earth outside as the aftershocks were hitting felt like you were on a boat on a rough sea. People were very shaken up and anxious.”

The quake hit near the Everest base camp, measuring at a shallow depth of about 12 miles (19 km).
The epicentre was around 40 miles west of Namche Bazaar, a remote area near the China border.
Aid agencies are struggling to get reports from outside the capital though hundreds of people are so far reported to be injured and several killed.
The disaster struck just three weeks after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake that struck on 25 April, killing at least 8,046 people and injuring more than 17,800 more.
The aid worker and former journalist added: “Our focus is on the children. And already after the first quake on 25 April, 1.7 million children are in urgent need of humanitarian aid in Nepal.
“They need clean water, shelter, sanitation, and our focus is on those children and how they have been impacted.”

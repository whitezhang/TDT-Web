MORE than 500 objections have been lodged against controversial plans to build a 230ft high chimney in Glasgow.The public consultation on the proposals by WH Malcolm ended last week - and hundreds of people have had their say on the development.As the Evening Times revealed last month, the construction firm wants to develop a waste plant in Scotstoun, west Glasgow, at the site of its current recycling yard.The plans for the Energy Recovery Facility include building a chimney taller than the Titan Crane at the plant at 865 South Street.Materials, including office waste, plastic, paper and wood will be 'gasified' on site.The move has attracted widespread criticism from members of the community, who say the development will pose a major health risk.Council officers are still sifting through the comments received on the planning application online and handed in to the council in person - but at this stage there are more than 500 objections lodged.A spokesman from Glasgow City Council confirmed that the consultation had ended.He added: &quot;We have received a planning application and it will be considered in due course.&quot;Among the objectors is Tony Clarke, from Whiteinch, who said the development was likely to cause pollution and would attract extra traffic to the site.He added: &quot;The application is not specific enough regarding how the waste will be heated, nor in how the resulting fumes will be safely disposed of.&quot;Cathie Russell, a member of Friends of Victoria Park, said the group submitted an objection.She said: &quot;We are concerned about many things, including air pollution and a 70-metre high chimney in an already urbanised area.&quot;Helena Lee, of Scotstoun, said she wanted to lodge a strong objection to the application.She is concerned about chemicals being spread across the environment, odour, dust and the landscape of the riverside changing with a steep chimney.She said: &quot;We do not have enough detail about what will happen to the waste matter when it is treated in the facility, and no guarantees that the facility will operate safely at all times, day and night, 365 days a year.&quot;Garscadden/Scotstounhill Councillor Graeme Hendry said the SNP group had been engaging with members of the community about the issue.He said: &quot;We sent 14,000 letters to local people to raise their awareness of the proposals and my concerns.&quot;The response has been incredible, with many coming to see me and hundreds of residents submitting objections to the plan.&quot;The public consultation has now ended and I hope the councillors sitting on planning will listen to the hundreds of local people who have tried to make their voices heard.&quot;Developers argue that the plant will provide state of the art waste treatment technologies.The application also also says air quality issues would be negligible and air pollution would be monitored by the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.Projections show in the worst case scenario people will take in 1.5 per cent of the daily tolerable intake of the chemicals, which can lead to cancer, damage the immune system and cause reproductive issues.A spokesman from the Malcolm Group said: &quot;We are very satisfied with the public consultation process and are awaiting the outcome.&quot;

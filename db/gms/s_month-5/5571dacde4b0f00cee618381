 DEVASTATED friends paid tribute yesterday to a young woman who has died of suspected meningitis . 
 Samantha Bernard, 25, took ill late on Tuesday. She was rushed to hospital in Edinburgh but passed away a short time later. 
Her brother Sean, 22, was too upset to comment and said his parents, George and Rosalind, were still at the hospital.
But dozens of tributes poured in online for Sam, who worked as a domestic at the Western General Hospital in the city.
Gary Thomson wrote: “Woke up with sad news today. How young people can be taken away so suddenly. Heaven has definitely gained another cangel.”
Childhood pal Leanne Hamilton said: “Such a shock. She was a happy, bubbly wee girl. Absolutely adorable. Life can be cruel.”
 Dr Graham MacKenzie, consultant in public health at NHS Lothian , sent their condolences to Sam’s family last night, adding: “At this stage, the exact cause of death is not clear. However, we have no evidence to suggest that it was due to Meningococcal disease, an infectious form of bacterial meningitis.”

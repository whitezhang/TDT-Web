IT has been five years since Laura Riches had her hair cut so when she recently decided on a change of style she wanted to make sure it was a special event.The 30-year-old from Renfrew, whose long locks reached beyond the bottom of her back, is donating them to a charity for alopecia sufferers, to be made into wigs.With nearly 30 inches chopped off, she will go from having long hair to a short pixie cut.&quot;I've had long hair for years now and wanted to get it cut but there are a lot of people out there, whether cancer or alopecia sufferers, and they are not as lucky as me,&quot; she said.&quot;And I have friends who have had really bad alopecia so I've seen how devastating it can be.&quot;I hunted and hunted and eventually found to Autoimmune Alopecia Research UK (AAR-UK). They will give my hair to a company that makes wigs for people with alopecia.&quot;As well as raising money from sponsors for AAR-UK, Laura, who was diagnosed with MS two years ago, is also taking the opportunity to do some fundraising for Revive MS Support, a non-profit centre in Maryhill that offers therapy, help and advice to patients and families.The receptionist at Scottish Power had her appointment with the scissors at Orasculpt in West Regent Street, Glasgow, with husband Marc and mum Ellen Rose there to cheer her on.&quot;I was quite nervous, I have no idea how it would feel when it was cut off,&quot; she said.To donate, visit www. mydonate.bt.com/fundraisers/laurariches1

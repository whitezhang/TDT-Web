BBC weather presenter Judith Ralston cried “tears of relief” after her car was freed from a locked car park by two police officers and a security guard.
The TV star – who presents the weather on BBC Scotland – was in Dundee to host the Tayside Contracts Excellence Awards ceremony at the Caird Hall on Friday.
She used the nearby Overgate car park but returned later to find she was 30 minutes too late and her car was locked in.
However, two police officers, PC Chris Coleman and PC Nigel Green, and Overgate security guard Brian came to her aid.
Judith said: “I was locked out and had to get back to Glasgow for my kids and thought ‘what am I going to do?’
“Then, two policemen came round the corner. They managed to get in touch with the guy in charge of the car park.”

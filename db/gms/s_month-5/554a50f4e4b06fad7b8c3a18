TWO Still Game stars have backed the SNP in the General Election.Gavin Mitchell, who plays hapless Boaby the barman and Greg Hemphill, who plays pensioner Victor, said they are voting for Nicola Sturgeon's party.Gavin met with Glasgow South candidate Chris Stephens and SNP minister Humza Yousaf in Govan, where he showed off his bartending technique.He said:&quot;I was Labour all my life, from a Labour supporting family. Coming up to the referendum and after Tony Blair and illegal wars, I thought its a disgrace what's been happening.&quot;It's an exiting time for Scotland and people feel they have a voice and can see a road to change.&quot;Greg said:&quot;I'm supporting Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP because it's the best way to protect Scotland in this election.&quot;A strong Scottish voice in Westminster is vital to get rid of the Tories and stop the cuts which are damaging public services and forcing folk into poverty.&quot;

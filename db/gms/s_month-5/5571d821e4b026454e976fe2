THE distraught father of the schoolgirl crushed to death when a wall at her school collapsed has revealed he contemplated taking his own life.
 Clark Bennett admits was close to suicide in the weeks after 12-year-old Keane Wallis-Bennett was killed last April. 
Doctors feared the 48-year old chef, who went into a deep depression after the death of his daughter, might kill himself.
 

Clark told the Sun: “In my darkest days, I thought about taking my own life. I was described anti-depressants and put on suicide watch.
“I had no idea if the medicine was working or not - I still don’t know how I am supposed to feel. I will never get over losing Keane. I feel empty and lost without her.”
 Keane was killed last year when a partition wall collapsed on her in a changing room before PE at Liberton High School, Edinburgh. 
A health and safety investigation into the accident has still to report its findings.

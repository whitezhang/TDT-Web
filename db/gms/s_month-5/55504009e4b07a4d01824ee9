SCOTTISH Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said his party is still "hopeful for the future" as he insisted next year's Holyrood elections are an "opportunity to grow".The Liberal Democrats lost 10 of the 11 Scottish seats they had held at Westminster as the general election saw an SNP tsunami sweep Scotland.Nicola Sturgeon's party now has 56 MPs, with only Alistair Carmichael, who had been the Scottish Secretary in the coalition government, managing to retain his Orkney and Shetland seat.But former UK party leader Charles Kennedy and Danny Alexander, who had been the chief secretary to the Treasury, are among the leading Scottish Liberal Democrats who were ejected from the House of Commons.Despite that Mr Rennie said: &quot;Our vision for Scotland is hopeful for the future, founded on opportunity and liberty for all. It is a positive prospectus.&quot;A year from now we have an opportunity to grow. The Scottish Parliamentary Election campaign starts today.&quot;Mr Rennie paid tribute to the Scottish Lib Dems who had lost their seats and said: &quot;Scotland has lost liberal giants. Our Members of Parliament were local champions with powerful liberal voices. They enriched the political debate of our country.&quot;I am sad for the loss to our party, to their communities and to the politics of our country. I know they will make a contribution to rebuilding our strength.&quot;Some 2,000 people across the UK have joined the Liberal Democrats since the election, the party said.Meanwhile Mr Rennie argued it had a &quot;ongoing duty&quot; to the 219,675 people in Scotland who voted for them to &quot;promote liberal values&quot;.The Scottish Liberal Democrat leader added: &quot;That duty is even important in the face of a Conservative majority at Westminster, already planning to bring back the Snoopers Charter that we blocked in Government.&quot;And in the Scottish Parliament the job goes on with the centralising and often illiberal agenda being pursued by the SNP.&quot;He continued: &quot;We will heed the lessons and message of the election result. It has been a body blow to our party but that over 2,000 new members have joined the party in just one day gives me great hope.&quot;

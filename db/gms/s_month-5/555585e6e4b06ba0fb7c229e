DAVID Cameron he will make good on his promise to deliver more powers as he visits Scotland for the first time since his election victory.The Prime Minister is in the country to meet First Minister Nicola Sturgeon where more powers for the Scottish Parliament will be top of the agenda.Mr Cameron said he is committed to delivering the recommendations of the Smith Commission as a Holyrood Committee warns the current plans are not good enough and don't match what was agreed.Ms Sturgeon has also warned even if Smith is delivered it doesn't go far enough following the SNP success in the General Election and has called for powers over employment, welfare and tax to be given to Scotland.The Prime Minister said a devolution bill will be in the first Queen's Speech.He said a new Scotland Bill would see an unprecedented rise in the powers of the Scottish Parliament, with Holyrood becoming one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.He said: &quot;I am here today to underline my commitment to our United Kingdom and Scotland's important place within it&quot;.&quot;That means remaining true to the promise we made to implement the all-party Smith agreement to make Scotland one of the most accountable and powerful devolved parliaments in the world&quot;.&quot;It also means recognising those things which unite us in these islands: the achievements we have made together, the institutions we have built together, our great social history, the common economic challenges we face today, and the strength which comes from pulling together for the common good in the future. This is our One Nation agenda in action&quot;.Ms Sturgeon warned this week if the UK Government do not recognise that Scotland voted for 56 SNP MSPs calling for more devolution than was included in the Smith recommendations, he risked alienating public opinion.It was public opinion she said would determine whether and when there would be another independence referendum.She said: &quot;How David Cameron, his government and the Westminster system choose to respond to the message Scotland has sent will be crucial to how we move forward.&quot;Mr Cameron said: &quot;As more powers are devolved to Scotland, it is time to move beyond the debate about processes and focus on those bread and butter issues that affect every family in our United Kingdom, jobs, homes, good schools and strong public services, and dignity and respect in retirement. These are the building blocks we need to provide a brighter future for people in every part of our country.&quot;

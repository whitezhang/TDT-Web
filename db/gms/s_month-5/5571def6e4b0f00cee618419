RECORD numbers of rockers descended on a Scots town to pay tribute to former AC/DC frontman Bon Scott yesterday.
Hundreds of diehard fans headed to Angus, where the star grew up, for the annual celebration of Bonfest.
The event, held over Friday and Saturday, saw Kirriemuir's Gateway to the Glens museum welcome its largest ever number of visitors in a single day as 500 people poured in to see the UK's largest rare memorabilia collection.
The town has hosted the event since 2006 to mark the place where the rocker spent his early years before emigrating to Australia and formed the band with Glasgow-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.
This year's music extravaganza got underway as the world's biggest rock band prepares to embark on its Rock or Bust world tour.
The town's pubs were filled with rock bands who played throughout the day and into the evening in tribute to Scott - who died in 1980 aged 33, following a night out in London.
One of the organisers, Graham Galloway, told the Dundee Courier: &quot;We had many people from all over the UK, some from well down south who had been setting off at four or five o'clock in the morning to get here.&quot;

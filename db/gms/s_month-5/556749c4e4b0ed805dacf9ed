AFTER yet another dire year for the UK at Eurovision, the Glasgow School of Art Choir says they could do better.
The group, preparing for its annual summer concert on Saturday, said they have already proved they can draw a sell-out crowd and also boast an international line-up of students, staff and alumni.
Music Director Jamie Sansbury said more singers continue to join in, now at record numbers with 52 set to perform on Saturday. They originally started with 15 three and a half years ago.
He said: “We’re already as flashy as any Eurovision entry and we have just as much fun as the audience, so we could easily do better.
“The GSA singing community keep going from strength to strength and we’re recording our first album in the coming year.”
In recent months, the choir has welcomed even more men, which Jamie admitted can be a challenge to encouraging them to venture into something different. But now that he has them, it has changed the range of music they can perform.
He said: “We will be doing a huge range of repertoire at the concert, from early classical to traditional Scottish songs to contemporary choral music. Not quite Eurovision, but more in tune.”
Jamie, who graduates in the coming weeks but will be continuing to lead the choir as an architecture alumni, said members drew a great deal of strength from the group after the fire a year ago. The community has been so supportive their Christmas concert was a sell-out to a packed Adelaides in Bath Street.
The concert takes place at Adelaide’s Auditorium on May 30 from 7.30pm. Tickets, at &pound;8 or &pound;6 (concession) are available online.
A new choir website will be launched on June 12 to coincide with the GSA Degree Show.

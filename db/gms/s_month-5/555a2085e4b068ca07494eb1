The raids were carried out at properties in Lanarkshire, Tayside, Fife and Dumfries and Galloway, as part of the operation codenamed Wolfberry. 
A 44-year-old man and 35-year-old woman were arrested by Police Scotland during the operation and charged with human trafficking and related offences.
They were expected to appear at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court.

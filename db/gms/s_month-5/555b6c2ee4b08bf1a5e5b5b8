The Daily Record and Sunday Mail were delighted, once again, to be the media partner of the UKâ€™s biggest women-only running event - the Morrison's Great Women's 10k Glasgow on Sunday May 17.
Thousands of women braved the weather to pound the streets of Glasgow to run, jog and walk and raise thousands of pounds for a variety of great causes.
Despite the rain, our social media POD was packed full with runners and spectators alike, who were eager to record their moment of this great event and get their pictures taken.
Congratulations to all those who took part!

TWO of the men accused of plotting to murder Johnny “Mad Dog” Adair were seen together by undercover police in June 2013, jurors heard yesterday.
Detective Constable Allan Derrick said he was doing surveillance on Antoin Duffy when he saw him with John “Piddy” Gorman near Duffy’s Glasgow home.
He said he watched for about 10 minutes as the two men “walked up and down the street several times”. The court heard police watched Duffy in May, June, July, August, September and October of 2013.
DC Derrick also told the court he saw Duffy with another accused, Paul Sands, at Buchanan bus station in Glasgow on October 23, 2013. He agreed that a number of people were arrested in connection with terror offences that day.
Duffy, 39, Gorman, 58, Sands, 31, and Martin Hughes, 36, deny conspiring to murder former Ulster Freedom Fighters leader Adair and his ex-colleague Sam “Skelly” McCrory, who both live in Ayrshire.
Duffy and Gorman also deny being part of a plot to kill the governor of Barlinnie jail with a car bomb. Three other men deny organised crime charges.
The trial at the High Court in Glasgow continues.

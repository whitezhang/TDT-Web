 A shocked community will pay their final respects to tragic teen Aaliyah Sutherland this week. 
 Friends and family of the 13-year-old will release Chinese lanterns in her memory after a funeral  service in Galashiels. 
A collection will also be taken for ChildLine.
 Aaliyah , a second year pupil at Earlston High, was found dead at her home at nearby Clovenfords last  Sunday. Police have said there are no suspicious circumstances. 
 Fellow pupils at Earlston and at Aaliyah’s former school, Galashiels Academy , were offered counselling after the tragedy. 
In a tribute on Facebook her grandfather Steve Bond wrote: “I will always love and miss you sweetheart and wish I could have been there when you needed me.”

ANIMAL welfare inspectors have appealed for information after a dog was weighted down with stones and thrown in a pond.
The animal, a young female Staffordshire bull terrier type, had been struck on the head, neck and body before being put in the water in Newmains, North Lanarkshire, a post-mortem examination revealed.
Scottish SPCA inspectors were called in after the dead animal was discovered in the pond, near Overtown Road, on Friday.
Inspector Heather Lawson, from the animal welfare charity, said the dog had been in the water for 24 to 48 hours before being found.
She urged anyone with information about what happened to the dog to get in contact.
With the post-mortem showing the dog had been hit, it is not known if the animal was still breathing when she was thrown into the water.
Ms Lawson said: “Although the trauma to her head and neck was significant it would have been unlikely to be the cause of death, which is unexplained at this stage. It is not yet known if she was still breathing when she entered the water.
“The dog had been weighed down with two large, slab-like stones which had been tied to her lead.
“She was a young brown female Staffordshire bull terrier type and other than her injuries was in good bodily condition. She was a very unusual colour for this breed as this shade of brown is more commonly seen in Patterdale terriers or chocolate labradors.
“We would appeal to anyone who recognises the description of this dog and knows who may have done this to her to contact us on 03000 999 999.”

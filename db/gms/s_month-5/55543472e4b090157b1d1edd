CASH-STRAPPED Glasgow Kelvin College has handed over hundreds of thousands of pounds to a private catering company running a loss-making cafe at its city campus.Contracts drawn up by the management of Stow College before a merger with John Wheatley College and North Glasgow College means the cafe must be subsidised if it is not making &quot;sufficient revenue&quot;.Minutes of board of management meetings seen by the Evening Times reveal that more than &pound;100,000 was paid to contract caterers Elior last year.The leaked report said: &quot;The cost of this contract is absorbed as management fee in relation to the sales made, currently the catering company are not making sufficient revenue and we are having to subsidise this contract in the region of &pound;110,168 plus vat.&quot;Glasgow Kelvin College bosses intend to close the former Stow College building by July 2016 and cancelling the catering contract will cost a further &pound;108,308, according to the report entitled 'Decommissioning of City Campus'.However, the college management is desperate to make savings and agreed to hand over the lump sum to Elior to avoid haemorrhaging more cash on subsidies for the loss-making cafe.College catering staff whose employment contracts were transferred to Elior in 2012 when the French multinational won the tender are believed to be &quot;furious&quot; at bosses who signed off on the deal.Mandy McDowell of trade union Unison, which represents staff, said: &quot;They feel particularly aggrieved as they told management that they were making an expensive mistake before the college catering services were outsourced to a private company.&quot;In fact staff went on strike to stop this privatisation happening and they were vilified by management.&quot;Even we were surprised by the amount of money being paid to this Elior. This is a very large multinational company which signed a contract which means they had no risks while the tax payers took all the financial risk.&quot;It is a disgraceful waste when the further education sector is struggling under the cuts.&quot;Students who are campaigning against the cancellation of a BA Drama and Performance course at the college also hit out at management.Spokeswoman for 'Bring back our BA', Abbie Johnston said: &quot;It doesn't surprise us that the management is spending hundreds of thousands of pounds subsidising a cafe that no one goes to.&quot;The people in charge are not making decisions with the best interests of students at heart.&quot;The new college is currently accepting bids from catering companies keen to take over the running of cafes at all of its campuses and The Evening Times understands Elior is in the running.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Kelvin College said: &quot;I can confirm that on merger in November 2013 we inherited a contract, from legacy Stow College with Elior for catering services, which contained considerable exit costs.&quot;As a result of the Glasgow-wide curriculum review for further education, the college has planned a phased relocation of learning activity from the City Campus building, formerly Stow College.&quot;Regrettably, this means that contracts for services associated with that building will be terminated and the college has met routinely with Elior since last year in relation to this planned closure in order that the company can engage appropriately with their staff.&quot;Unison's Ms McDowell said catering services should now be brought back under the control of college management.She added: &quot;Expensive contracts like this are draining further education colleges of money and resources.&quot;The college is now tendering again for outside contracts despite no evaluation to see if the service is better, worse or more costly. We should consider in house bids.&quot;The Evening Times contacted Elior but the company did not respond to a request for a comment.

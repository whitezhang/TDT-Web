COMMUTERS are being urged to donate tins to a food bank being set up in Central Station to help support Glasgow City Mission.On Thursday a 12-hour donation drive is being held at Scotland's busiest station and passengers and railway staff are being asked to contribute what they can.Organised by station officer Jim Frizzle, the donation drive is the largest of its kind to be held in Scotland and follows the success of a similar event in March last year which saw over five van loads, equalling nine months of donations, collected at the station.With a footfall of around 106,000 passengers every day, the station team hope to once again help hundreds of struggling families.Mr Frizzle said: &quot;I was overwhelmed by people's generosity last year and if we can achieve even half as many donations this time around then I'll be ecstatic.&quot;We all usually have something in our cupboard that we don't need or won't use so please look out what you can as it will really make a difference to those individuals who are struggling.&quot;The food bank collection will be running on Thursday from 7am until 7pm and a collection point, manned by staff volunteers, will take donations in the centre of the concourse, close to the clock.Glasgow City Mission needs tinned meat meals like stew, curry, pies, tinned meat or fish, tinned fruit or vegetables, tinned puddings, breakfast cereal and UHT long-life milk, coffee, sugar, diluting juice and toiletriesTo learn more about Glasgow City Mission, visit: http://www.glasgowcitymission.com/

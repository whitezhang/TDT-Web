A GLASGOW bus garage that was open just a decade but is now home to a stunning heritage collection of buses is to mark its half-centenary next month.A party is being thrown to mark the occasion - and all former employees are being asked along.The Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust has turned the former Bridgeton bus garage, in Fordneuk Street, into a heritage centre, with more than 100 buses, coaches, commercial vehicles and fire engines.It is restoring a 1904 Glasgow tram, and its oldest bus is a 1934 model that was brought to Scotland all the way from Malta.The Trust's Dr Alistair Ramsay MBE said yesterday: &quot;Bridgeton is one of the few remaining bus depots. It was built to house the buses that were going to be the replacement of the trams, which last ran in 1962.&quot;We're extremely proud of the collection of vintage vehicles we have built up here over the years but we thought it would be a nice idea to mark the 50th anniversary of the garage itself. It played a key role in the city's bus network, after all.&quot;The garage was opened in 1965 by the then Glasgow Corporation. It did not last very long, being closed in 1975 at the time of local government reorganisation, and was taken over by the old Strathclyde Regional Council, which used it as an internal transport depot.In 2003, the Trust leased the garage from the city council and began to move in its impressive collection of vehicles.Added Dr Ramsay: &quot;The garage's 50th birthday doesn't fall until June 7 but we want to celebrate in style with a birthday party and the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate the event.&quot;We're very keen to reach out to anyone who worked at the garage, either for Glasgow Corporation Transport between 1965 and 1975, or for Strathclyde Regional Council's Internal Transport Department from 1975 to 1996, to get in touch with us.&quot;We'd love them to join us for the party and contribute stories, photographs or memorabilia to the event.&quot;The plaque will be unveiled on the day by councillor Frank McAveety, a board member of Clyde Gateway.Vehicles from the Trust's collection regularly take part in events within Glasgow - and members of the public can often get the chance to travel on them.* To contact the Trust, phone 0141-554 0544 or email info@gvvt.org.

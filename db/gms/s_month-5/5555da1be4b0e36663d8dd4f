SNP MP Kirsten Oswald’s convinced 23,000 voters to back her in East Renfrewshire as she swept aside Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy - but it seems she has yet to win over her husband.The 42-year-old politician’s spouse Davinder Bedi joined the Labour Party yesterday and wrote about his decision on Facebook.Mr Bedi, 45, who lives in East Renfrewshire with Oswald and their two children, underlined his opposition to independence and asked how he could help his new “friends”.The book distributor also spoke of his hope that Scottish Labour will break away from the UK party.Writing on the ‘Scottish Labour for Scotland’ Facebook discussion forum, he said: “Dear friends, and I do regard you as friends albeit that I have never met you, yesterday I joined the party and I’m glad I did because I want to help effect change.”“I want my party (this party) to be truly representative of our people - Scots. I want a party which is fundamentally opposed to independence yet one which is ready to lead in Scotland should that occur. A party which looks after Scots and speaks for Scottish people and Scottish businesses. Perhaps one which is aligned to the UK Labour Party rather than integrated with it. Definitely one which can help the UK Labour movement to win power and change people’s lives.”Mr Bedi, who has been married to East Renfrewshire MP Kirsten Oswald for thirteen years, also spoke of his fears that Scottish Labour will suffer a humiliating defeat at next year’s Holyrood election.He said: “My worry, however, is that the UK party may travel in the wrong direction for our purposes and if that happens we can kiss goodbye to a positive result next year. So my question to you my friends is how can I help us change? How can I be heard?”Party members responded by welcoming Mr Bedi and urged him to get involved in his local party activities.Mr Bedi, who has ‘liked’ Facebook pages in support of his wife’s election rival Jim Murphy, said he had received a text from Labour which reassured him his “pack is in the post”.Ms Oswald, who has been elected to the SNP’s executive committee, admitted in an interview published today that her husband had not campaigned for her in East Renfrewshire.The former head of human resources at South Lanarkshire College said Mr Bedi is “incredibly proud of me” but “he wasn’t involved in the campaign”.Ms Oswald could not be reached for comment but an SNP spokeswoman said: “The days of husbands and wives voting the same way are long gone.“We are very satisfied at winning half of the popular vote in Scotland and 56 of the 59 seats.”

THUGS are targetting cars in a spate of break-ins across a south side community.Four cars were broken into in the early hours of yesterday morning, in what is the latest in a spike in vehicle crimes.Residents in Govanhill have been warned to be on the alert as vandals are using screwdrivers to pop the locks on cars.Local officer Sergeant Ian Winton said: &quot;We are aware of a slight increase in vehicle crime in the Govanhill area.&quot;We are currently investigating each incident and officers are continuing to carry out enquiries in the area in an effort to crack down on car crime, vandalism and anti-social behaviour in general using all available resources.&quot;It is believed to be the same person, or group of people, carrying out attacks on cars across Govanhill.Robbers are looking for quick access to valuables, removing the locks from vehicle doors so as not to trigger car alarms.The latest break-ins happened in the early hours of Monday morning, targetting four cars parked off Coplaw Street.Residents spoke of their alarm after the incident.One woman, who asked not to be named, said: &quot;It is normally very, very quiet around here and we never have any trouble so I'm really shocked that we have been targeted.&quot;It's not just that the cars have been broken into here but the thought of people hanging around outside our homes.&quot;I work at night and so it's really worrying to think that these criminals are working in the area and could be outside at night when I get home.&quot;I feel quite intimidated.&quot;The spate comes as officers across the city take part in Operation Quarterlight, a national bid to crack down on car and vehicle crime.In Glasgow, 253 vehicle crimes were detected with 66 people being arrested in connection with these incidents.Since its launch in November 2014, nearly 900 vehicle related crimes have been detected across Scotland, with detection rates increasing across most of the country.More than 350 people have been charged with a number of vehicle related crimes in that time, including theft and attempted theft of motor vehicles, and house breaking with vehicles being stolen.In Forth Valley, several high profile offenders - including two from Glasgow - who have been responsible for more than 60 vehicle related crimes in the area, have been identified, and are either in custody, or have warrants active against them.Officers in Greater Glasgow and Argyll and West Dunbartonshire staged a joint operation to trace and detain a known offender reported for more than 50 crimes.Mr Winton added: &quot;We would urge drivers to be aware and local people to be aware of preventative measures to keep their vehicles safe.&quot;Anyone who witnesses or who has witnessed any incidents of car crime should call police on the non-emergency number, 101, contact Crimestoppers or call 999.&quot;

A CARMYLE schoolboy paid tribute to his great, great grandfather by playing him in a poignant re-enactment of the First World War at a school play.Tomas Malone, 11, played the role of his ancestor, Lance Corporal William Haddow of the Cameron Highlanders, who died on the front line in France at the age of 16.Mr Haddow, who was just 15-years-old when he signed up, lied about his age to join troops destined for the front line.Tomas said: &quot;I think it's sad that he died at that age. He thought it was going to be over by Christmas.&quot;Tomas joined 23 of his P7 classmates as they took on the identities of local soldiers - who they researched as part of their First World War studies - for the performance.The nine act performance followed the chronology of the First World War, opening with Haddow discussing his intentions to sign up with pals at a local hostelry in Carmyle on the eve of war.The last act centred on the last survivor of the group, Corporal William Pollock of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers, from Tollcross, before he too succumbed to the conflict in 1919.Each act was penned by the children and was interspersed with war songs and poetry.Anne Hutchison, teacher, said: &quot;The children have brought local history to life and we are all so happy about the show.&quot;The experience of the war and its impact on people from their families and communities has lent their studies an underlying authenticity.&quot;The uniform materials were donated by City Building's Royal Strathclyde Blindcraft Industries and tailored by their seamstress Inderjit Gill.Following the performance, a First World War memorial bench dedicated to the fallen from Carmyle and Tollcross was unveiled in the school garden.The inscription on a brass plaque reads: 'For all the men from Carmyle and Tollcross who sacrificed themselves so we could live in peace. Thank you. Miss Hutchison and P7, 2015.'

A SCOTS climber who was trapped on Mount Everest after the deadly Nepal earthquake has spoken of his delight at finally been reunited with his family.
James Grieve, 52, from Kinross, flew home yesterday after cheating death by clinging to the mountain face with an ice pick when a wall of snow swept down the worldâ€™s tallest peak last month.
He told The Sun: &quot;I cuddled Shirley at Edinburgh Airport and when I got back I played with my wee boy James. How lucky am I?
&quot;It feels great to be home. I was thinking about my family quite a lot. And when I was on the phone to Shirley all the emotions just came out.&quot;
James, an engineer, who was scaling Everest to raise money for charity Children 1st, was with four UK partners when the avalanche hit, obliterating their route to the top.
The disaster claimed 7,000 lives and killed 19 fellow climbers and an emotional James said he felt fortunate to be back with his partner Shirley McGhie, 41, and one-year-old son in Scotland.
Despite his ordeal, James hopes to attempt Everest again next year.

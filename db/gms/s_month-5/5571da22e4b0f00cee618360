 MUSIC fans are being given the chance to bid for Voice star Stevie McCrorie’s signed guitar. 
 The &pound;1300 instrument helped see Stevie crowned the winner of BBC’s The Voice talent contest and was played as he gigged around Scotland, throughout his journey on The Voice and during recent gigs and special events. 
Since being crowned winner, he has composed songs on it, some of which will be on his new album.
 

Now Stevie has given the guitar to the John Hartson Foundation to help raise funds and awareness of testicular cancer.

 The 30-year-old, from Alva, Clackmannanshire, has also agreed to be the charity’s newest ambassador after he joined John and a host of sports stars to launch the Know Your Balls campaign at a recent golf day. 
The deadline for bids is 5.20pm tomorrow (Saturday, May 16) on http://www.ebay.com/itm/141659071594

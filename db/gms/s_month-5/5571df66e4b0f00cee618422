A SCOTS bride had the Greatest Day when Take That’s Mark Owen crashed her wedding.
Dr Elaine McCaffrey, 26, from Paisley, and her new dentist husband Gregor Mcintosh 28, from Stirling, couldn’t believe it when Mark asked to be in her wedding photos during her reception at Cameron House hotel in Loch Lomond.
Mark’s offer came when Elaine’s bridesmaids saw the band on their way to the SSE Hydro to play the last of their five Glasgow gigs.
A thrilled Elaine said: “We have always been huge fans of Take That and Gregor met some of my family for the first time at one of their concerts.
“I’ve been to so many of their concerts so it made my day.
“It’s unbelievable. Mark came in and asked if he could be in the wedding photographs before giving me a kiss and then wishing us all the best for the future. It really finished the day off. We only found out the band were here when we arrived on Sunday.”
Elaine sent some of her wedding cake - made specially by Suzanne Esper Cakes - to the boys after their final show.

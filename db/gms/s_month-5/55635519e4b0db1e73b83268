AN ACADEMIC who promoted the Conservatives' vision for more powers for Scotland will now advise the Tory government on putting those powers into law.
 Professor Adam Tomkins, who negotiated for the Tories alongside peer Annabel Goldie on the cross-party Smith Commission, has been invited to advise the Secretary of State for Scotland on constitutional matters. 
The unpaid advisory role will see Prof Tomkins provide advice on a range of constitutional matters, with a primary focus on the passage of the Scotland Bill through Parliament and the delivery of new powers for the Scottish Parliament.
 

He is a legal scholar and John Millar Professor of Public Law at the School of Law of the University of Glasgow.
Professor Tomkins said: &quot;It is a great privilege to have been asked to support the Secretary of State for Scotland through this crucial period for Scotland. I look forward to working with the minister and his wider team to provide support for the Scotland Bill process.&quot;
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: &quot;Professor Tomkins brings unparalleled expertise and depth of knowledge to further support the Scotland Office. His advice and insight will be invaluable as we deliver new powers for the Scottish Parliament.&quot;

A MEMORIAL garden set up in the wake of the Stockline Plastics Factory tragedy will be passed into the hands of victims' families, survivors and the community.Today marks the 11th anniversary of the disaster, which happened just after midday on May 11, 2004.Nine people died and dozens of others were injured after an explosion - subsequently blamed on a leak of liquified petroleum gas from a corroded pipe -caused the four story factory in Firhill, Glasgow, to collapse.Now the Evening Times can reveal the garden - set by ICL Plastics Ltd , which owned the factory, three years after the explosion - is being transferred to a community trust.As we previously reported, local people have been fighting for more than three years to take over the remembrance spot.They feared it was being rundown and wanted a say in its future.Annette Doyle, Peter Ferguson, Thomas McAulay, Tracy McErlane, Ann Trench, Stewart McColl, Margaret Brownlie, Kenneth Murray, and Tim Smith all lost their lives.Gary Gentles, development services manager of Maryhill Community Central Halls, has been in talks with loved ones of the victims about what they would like to see at the garden.They hope to introduce a sculpture and more benches.The memorial site was on a long-term lease from City Property to ICL Plastics Ltd pension fund. It went to Glasgow City Council's Executive Committee in March and it is now ready to be transferred into the ownership of the community.A trust, which will include families, survivors, Community Hall members, STUC members, councillors and other locals will oversee decisions and maintenance of the memorial site.Mr Gentles said: &quot;This has been going on for a good while. But now we'll be able to get the garden up and running.&quot;We want it to be a place for everyone to go.&quot;Mr Gentles, who helped out in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, said the move was &quot;fully backed&quot; by victims' families.He added: &quot;You can't put yourself in the families' shoes. Their son or daughter went to work and didn't come back.&quot;I don't think you ever forget. When I'm standing outside and the weather's really nice sometimes I'll get a wee flash back.&quot;You never forget something like that.&quot;Councillor Martin McElroy added: &quot;The vision is to have it for anyone in the area to come and enjoy it, and to have that permanent memorial.&quot;We want feedback from families, survivors, and those in the wider community about what they'd like to see.&quot;

THOUSANDS of people have signed a petition to save The Arches just hours after the shock night club closure was announced.
In the space of just five hours, more than 7000 people have added their names to the online petition calling for Glasgow City Council to reinstate the internationally-renowned venue's license.
The local authority's decision, announced at a licensing committee hearing today, comes after concerns from Police Scotland over drug use and disorder at the club, which has attracted some of the world's biggest DJs for decades.
The council agreed the venue would now have to close at midnight instead of 3am, effectively ending its ability to operate as a nightclub. The change takes place immediately.
The nightclub came under fire in March after 26 people were reported for drugs and alcohol-related offences in one night while a woman also collapsed outside the venue after a dance event was marred by trouble.
Police Scotland said there were “potentially lethal and profound consequences” unless problems were addressed.
But Arches fan Zara Kitson wrote on the change.org petition: &quot;This decision will do nothing to solve our city's problems with alcohol and drugs misuse. What it will do, is help to kill our night time economy, and our city's cultural identity.&quot;
Craig Dorman added: &quot;The arches is a musical institution and being consistently in the top 100 clubs in the world should make it a no brainer to keep its 3am license. If the arches shuts its doors glasgows dance music scene is dead.&quot;
Superstar DJ Tall Paul also reacted to the news on Facebook, saying the loss of the club was a &quot;shocker&quot;.

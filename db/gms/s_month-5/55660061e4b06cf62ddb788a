The Arches venue in Glasgow is to appeal against the recent controversial decision by Glasgow Licensing Board's to curtail its clubbing activity.The Arches met Creative Scotland and senior city officials to explore a number of possible avenues for the continuation of the venue's cultural programmes and activity.Creative Scotland and Glasgow City Council have now agreed to provide an advance on their agreed 2015-16 funding to support The Arches.This will help the venue to &quot;deliver its current programme in the short-term, and in gaining specialist advice to enable it to properly consider all future options&quot; a statement says.At the same meeting, The Board of Directors for The Arches decided that, following legal advice, the venue will proceed with an appeal against the Licensing Board's limiting of the venue to a midnight licence - a decision which would effectively close its club and have a devastating effect on its future as a cultural centre.Lucy Mason, Artistic Director, and Mark Anderson, Executive Director of The Arches said: &quot;The Board of The Arches is grateful for and has agreed to the funding package offered by Creative Scotland and Glasgow City Council, which provides for stability in the short-term as we look to find a more permanent solution in the weeks to come.&quot;&quot;At the same time, having taken appropriate legal advice, we believe there are grounds to appeal the decision of the Licensing Board and will now proceed on that basis.&quot;All scheduled arts events between now and the end of June will go ahead as planned with club events moved to alternative venues.The following scheduled events will go ahead at The Arches as planned:Wed 3 - Fri 5 June: On The Verge 2015Thu 4 - Sun 21 June: Being HumanSat 6 June: The Big Glasgow Comic &amp; Craft FairSun 7 June: STANDThe following events have changed venue:Fri 19 June: Deviation: Benji B &amp; Kenny Dope - Now at La CheetahFri 26 June: Nervo - Now at O2 AcademySat 17 Oct: From The Jam - Now at SWG3The Arches was awarded 3 year funding of &pound;1.295m, with &pound;451,000 allocated for 2015/16 by Creative Scotland.&pound;200,000 of this has already been paid to the Arches and CS has now agreed to advance a further &pound;92,000, plus a contribution from Glasgow City Council of &pound;37,000.

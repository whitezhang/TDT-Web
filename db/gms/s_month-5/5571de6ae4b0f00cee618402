A COUPLE badly injured in a road crash have welcomed a sheriff’s decision not to jail the driver who ruined their lives.
Retired senior fire officer Malcolm Traquair and his partner Ruth Keighley, a nurse, will have to live with the effects of the crash for the rest of their lives.
But Malcolm, 62, said they were pleased company director Christopher Thornton, 36, had not been jailed.
Hours before his car ploughed into the couple’s motorbike on the A9 near Kingussie, Thornton had joked with a friend about falling asleep at the wheel.
He admitted driving dangerously knowing he was tired and was sentenced to the maximum 300 hours’ community work and banned for three years.
 

 
Inverness sheriff Gordon Fleetwood also ordered Thornton, from Bridge of Allan, Stirling, to resit his test before getting his licence back.
The court was told Ruth, 63, from Bearsden, near Glasgow , suffered brain injuries and had to learn to walk and talk again. She will never fully recover.
Malcolm has permanently lost the use of his right arm.
After the sentencing, Malcolm said the couple’s plans to travel the world in their retirement had been ruined by the August 2013 crash. But he added: “We did not want to see other lives ruined and him going to jail.
“He has to live with the consequences of the accident for the rest of his life. That is a punishment in itself.”
 
 
Dad-of-three Thornton was returning from a business trip to Elgin when tragedy struck. Before setting off, he sent a text to his business partner with a picture of cups of extra-strong coffee attached.
It read: “Hopeful of staying awake.”
Defence advocate Barry Smith said: “He does not know if he fell asleep at the wheel but accepts that inference can be taken.”
He added that his client still required medication and counselling.
Smith told the sheriff a jail term would have a grave effect on Thornton’s wife, who is a teacher, and his children as he earned the bulk of the family income.

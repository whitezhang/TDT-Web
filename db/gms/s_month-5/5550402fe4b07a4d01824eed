LABOUR'S leader in Scotland is being urged to resign by two trade unions in the wake of the party's disastrous results in the election.Unite and the train drivers' union Aslef called on Jim Murphy to stand aside because it was &quot;time for a change&quot;.Pat Rafferty, Unite's leader in Scotland, said: &quot;It is time for change in the Scottish Labour Party. That is the overwhelming, unambiguous message from Scotland's people, including its trade union members, on Thursday.&quot;Indeed, it is past time for change. Labour in Scotland has been bleeding support and credibility for years.&quot;On one issue after another - the embrace of 'Blairism', the opposition to a second 'devomax' question in last year's referendum, the decision to campaign with the Tories in the ill-judged Better Together campaign, and in the election of a new leader last year - Unite has warned against the course being followed by the party and has, alas, been proved right.&quot;The price of ignoring such warnings has been a virtual wipe-out for Scottish Labour at Westminster.&quot;The party has now less than a year to put this right before the Holyrood elections. Either Scottish Labour rediscovers its mission as the natural voice for social justice in our nation, or irrelevance and ultimately extinction looms.&quot;Kevin Lindsay, Aslef's organiser in Scotland, said: &quot;Jim Murphy has just presided over the worst election defeat in the history of the Scottish Labour Party. He has to go - and he has to go now.&quot;Ed Miliband, Harriet Harman, Nick Clegg, and even Nigel Farage have all stood down, accepting responsibility for, and the consequences of, defeat for their parties at the polls. It is, therefore, quite clear to most of us in the Scottish Labour Party what the right thing is for Jim Murphy to do.&quot;

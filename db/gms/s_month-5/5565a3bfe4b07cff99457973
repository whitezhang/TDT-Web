She’s East Kilbride’s brightest fundraising star ... and Jenny Cook has been lighting up even more lives.
The 12-year-old succeeded in turning East Kilbride Old Parish Church purple in support of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Day.
Jenny, from Stewartfield, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, won the support of South Lanarkshire Council and the Kirk to light the village church purple.
After darkness fell last Tuesday, Jenny and her mum and dad, Kirsteen and Barry, and wee brother Alex, along with some of her many supporters, went along to the lighting up ceremony.
 Jenny, who is well on her way to raising &pound;100,000 for both the Yorkhill Children’s Charity and the Catherine McEwan Foundation by the end of this  year has also vowed to raise &pound;5000 as part of IBD awareness month. 
The delighted youngster said: “It was an amazing night at East Kilbride Old Parish Church.
“I would like to thank South Lanarkshire Council and the Rev. Anne Paton for lighting the church up purple for IBD Awareness Day.
“Thank you so much to everyone that came to support me.”
 The youngster’s night didn’t end in East Kilbride and she  was whisked into Glasgow to see the iconic SSE Hydro turn purple. 
 

 
That was arranged by Cambuslang man Derek McEwan, who started the Catherine McEwan Foundation in memory of his mum who was just 38 when she died of Crohn’s disease.

CAMPAIGNERS against controversial changes to the centre of Kirkintilloch say extra safety measures don't go far enough.The plans for a 'shared space' - narrowing carriageways, reducing traffic speed and switching off lights - were voted through by councillors at a packed meeting which saw 400 people, many disabled, turn out in protest.East Dunbartonshire council voted for the changes by 13 votes to nine, with two extra pedestrian crossings at Catherine Street and Kerr Street added to the plans.Council leader Rhondda Geekie said they recognised &quot;a number of concerns expressed&quot; and they wanted to reassure people they had been listening.She said: &quot;We feel the amended proposals recognise and address those concerns - ensuring controlled crossings remain in place for anyone requiring additional reassurance in using the re-shaped junction.&quot;I am pleased we will also be establishing an Equality Design Forum, with officers and partner organisations working closely with members of the community.&quot;But campaigners said the last-minute safety concessions did not go far enough.Sandy Taylor, chairman of East Dunbartonshire Visually Impaired Forum, who has been leading the campaign against the plan, said they couldn't compromise on safety.He called for railings to be included and said the proposals, part of the Kirkintilloch Town Centre Masterplan had not been properly consulted on.He said: &quot;There has been no meaningful consultation whatsoever with disability groups.&quot;We have secured two pelican crossings and we are going to keep fighting.&quot;The council introduced the plan, which will see &pound;2.4m spent on redesigning the streets, to &quot;strike a new balance between drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.&quot;Part of the funding will come from Sustrans.Daisy Narayanan, deputy director of built environment, Sustrans Scotland, said: &quot;We actively support the council's work on the Kirkintilloch Masterplan and its ambition to regenerate the town centre.&quot;This project represents a significant investment from the council, Sustrans Scotland and SPT in the making the town centre a more economically and socially vibrant space with greater priority given to pedestrians, cyclists and access to public transport.&quot;

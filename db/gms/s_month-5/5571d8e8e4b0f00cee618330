PATIENT waiting times in accident and emergency departments have risen slightly, according to the latest weekly figures.
In the week ending May 10, 93.3% of people were seen and subsequently admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours at the 32 main A&amp;E departments, down from 93.5% in the previous week.
The Scottish Government has set an interim goal of treating 95% of people in four hours in advance of meeting the full target of 98%.
The figures show that 155 patients waited more than eight hours and 30 patients waited more than 12 hours.
This compares with the 76 patients who waited more than eight hours and three patients who waited more than 12 hours in the previous week.
The Government has launched a plan to improve unscheduled emergency care, while health boards are reviewing their plans ahead of next winter.
 Health Secretary Shona Robison said: &quot;Today's figures show that A&amp;E performance across Scotland has remained relatively stable with 93.3% of patients being seen and treated within four hours at core A&amp;E sites. 
 

&quot;This is an increase of over seven percentage points since weekly reporting began in February, and demonstrates that staff are continuing to work hard to see, treat and either discharge or admit patients within four hours.
&quot;While I do recognise that weekly performance will fluctuate, it is now crucial that, with ongoing support from the Scottish Government, health boards sustain the improvement seen since the winter and make further strides towards achieving the world leading targets we have in place.&quot;

 THE Scottish SPCA is seeking the owner of a peacock who tried to squeeze through a cat flap in Aberdeenshire . 
Scotland's animal welfare charity was alerted when the bird was discovered outside a house near Ordhead, Inverurie, on Monday.
 The peacock, who has been named Felix, is now in the care of the Scottish SPCA's animal rescue and rehoming centre in Drumoak. 
Animal Rescue Officer Helen Bissett said, &quot;I was able to catch Felix without any trouble.
 
&quot;He has some feathers missing from his head and neck so I think he has been in a tussle with another peacock recently.
&quot;Felix was pecking at the windows of the house and then tried to put his head through the cat flap.
&quot;At this stage we're not sure how he came to be there. It's possible he has strayed from home or he may have been abandoned. We're sure he does have an owner though as people do keep peacocks as pets.
&quot;If no one comes forward for this cheeky boy we'll find him a suitable new home.&quot;

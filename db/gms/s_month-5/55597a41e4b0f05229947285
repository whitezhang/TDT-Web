DOZENS of supercars gathered at a children's hospital in memory of a boy who lost his battle with cancer.Lee Jamieson, 12, died in August last year after suffering from leukaemia.Before his death, the Scottish Car Show would bring an array of vehicles to Yorkhill hospital for him to see, as he was too ill to leave the facility.To commemorate the youngster and raise funds for the hospital, Lee's family organised the Drive for Lee event yesterday and are keen to make it an annual traditionMore than 100 cars were on display outside the west end hospital, with children and their families marvelling at the array of motors.Lee's mum Elizabeth said: &quot;We want to thank everyone who joined us at Drive for Lee, for encouraging us to keep going and to stay positive.&quot;Lee was our son and our world with a smile as bright as the stars. He was loved to the moon and back.&quot;&quot;Since he was diagnosed in November 2013, the support of our friends and family has been incredible.&quot;Lee touched and inspired everyone we know and hundreds that we don't.&quot;We can't thank everyone enough for supporting the care teams who were looking after us.&quot;Since Lee's diagnosis, his family have helped to raise tens of thousands of pounds for Yorkhill Children's charity, Radio Lollipop and Leukaemia &amp; Lymphoma Research.The funds are vital in improving equipment, care and services for Scotland's sick children and their families.Kirsten Sinclair, director of fundraising at Yorkhill Children's Charity, said: &quot;Lee was an incredibly popular and inspiring young patient and it is a real testament to him that so many cars returned to Yorkhill to celebrate his memory with his family.&quot;It was really important for us to be able to hold this special event at Yorkhill, especially as we're on the move this summer to our new home at the Southern General campus.&quot;Thank you to everyone who came along and for your kind donations which will go a long way to helping Scotland's sick children and their families.&quot;

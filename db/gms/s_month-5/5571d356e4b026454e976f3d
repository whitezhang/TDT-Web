THIS quartet of football-loving dogs will be looking for some luck at Hampden Bark for this weekend’s Scottish Cup final.
Cheeky trio Rory, Hector and Buster have shown their true colours after having special Bairns scarves knitted for the big game against Inverness on Saturday.
And Caley fan Harris, a two-year-old retriever fron Nairn, went one better by donning the strip of his favourite team.
Little Buster’s Falkirk-daft owner Craig Richardson, 47, said: “Hopefully they can do it, because I wasn’t old enough to see them win the cup in 1957.
“With the dogs, it was my pal David’s wife Margaret who started the whole thing. It’ll be the talk of the place.”
Rory is owned by Craig’s pal David Lapsley, 60, while Hector belongs to his son David Jr, 30.
 

Meanwhile, Caley’s number one four-legged fan was gearing up for the final.
Harris was with owner Kirsty Ross at the town’s links yesterday.
Kirsty, 22, joked: “He won’t be making it to the final... unless we pretend he’s a guide dog. We thought we’d have to dress him up for the final and knew he’d be content.
“It’s the biggest event in his short life, the cup final.”
Kirsty added he could be the ideal replacement for outgoing left back Graeme Shinnie.
She said: “He’s very good with his head and he’s quick – so he’d be great on the wing.”

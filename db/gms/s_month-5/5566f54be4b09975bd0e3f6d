A RELIEVED bride has traced her missing wedding gifts after an appeal in the Daily Record.
Louise Murray, 28, was left heartbroken when her dad left bags of presents and a hand-made chest in a private hire car after her big day on Saturday.
She had married Martyn, 30, at the House for an Art Lover in Glasgow before heading back to a Renfrew hotel with her parents but dad John forgot to take the gifts from the boot.
Maths teacher Louise, from Beith, Ayrshire, called taxi firms to try and identify the driver and her mum Marie Woods, 58, contacted the Record for help.
The missing gifts were handed in to Partick police station yesterday.
Marie said: “I can’t thank you enough for your help.
“We can now remember the wedding for the perfect day it was.”

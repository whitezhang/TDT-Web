Police are appealing for witnesses after a 29-year-old man was seriously assaulted in a hairdresser's in Glasgow on Thursday.
The man was in Gary's Barber Shop in Springburn at about 16:15 when two men entered.
One of the men attacked the 29 year-old and he suffered &quot;lacerations to his head&quot;. He was treated at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Police said they were reviewing CCTV from the surrounding area.
Det Sgt Michael McCullagh said: &quot;The motive for this attack remains unknown and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident, who may have seen the two men fleeing the shop to contact us. 
&quot;We are still reviewing CCTV images in the hope that further information can be gleaned about this attack but I would urge people to please get in touch with us - what you saw or noticed may seem insignificant to you but it could help us piece together elements of this investigation and lead us to tracing those responsible for this crime.&quot;

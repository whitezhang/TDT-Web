A street trader who admitted selling counterfeit DVDs is to have &pound;38,000 seized under proceeds of crime laws.
Stuart Ashley, 39, was caught with a stash of fake discs at his home in Oban on 4 March 2013.
He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work after admitting breaching the Trade Marks Act 1994.
The confiscation order against Ashley, which covers the amount he is estimated to have earned from sales of fake DVDs, was granted at Oban Sheriff Court.
Procurator fiscal Lindsey Miller said: &quot;Ashley sought to line his pockets by undermining local businesses and the wider entertainment industry.
&quot;Such behaviour will not only result in prosecution, but in a full financial assessment with a view to recovering all available illegal earnings from an accused.&quot;

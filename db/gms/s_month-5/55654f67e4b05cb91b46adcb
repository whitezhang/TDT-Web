 AUSTRALIAN pop punk band 5 Seconds of Summer will be in Scotland on Monday - and can’t wait. 
 The quintet - Luke Hemmings, Michael Clifford, Calum Hood and Ashton Irwin will play to over 240,000 fans across the UK and Europe this year - and kick off the UK leg in Glasgow at The SSE Hydro on Monday. 
As well as starting the next phase of their career the Scottish opener will be one of their highlights of their first headline tour, Rock Out With Your Socks Out.

Scotland’s reputation as one of the world’s greatest audiences hasn’t gone unnoticed. The boys have opened for One Direction on their tours since 2013.
Luke said: “We are going to try and make the best live show possible for you guys, this is such a huge thing for us to be able to come and see you all. “We can not wait to play you the album and loads more, we love you guys and hope you are as excited as we are. Let’s rock let’s rock today”.
The band’s self-titled debut album only got to No2 in the UK although it hit the top in America. Their debut single, She Looks So Perfect went to No1 in the UK with follow up Don’t Stop going to No2. Third single Amnesia gave them three straight top 10 hits, getting to No7.

Amnesia will be one of the big singalongs of the night on Monday.
Luke added: “The song has so much meaning and it is one of the most heartfelt songs on the album and is really special to us as a band.”
The band have finished their second album and will follow their UK and Europe dates with their first-ever North American headlining tour, kicking off on July 17 at the Mandalay Bay Event Center in Las Vegas, Nev.
The first taste of the new album will be new song Permanent Vacation.

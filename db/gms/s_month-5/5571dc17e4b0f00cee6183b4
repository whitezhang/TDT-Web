David Cameron insisted today there would not be a second referendum on Scottish independence in the next five years.
The Tory Prime Minister was asked by Channel 4 news if he was confident he would not be the last Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the wake of the SNP's stunning success in the General Election.
&quot;Very confident. The United Kingdom voted to stay together in that referendum,&quot; he said.
&quot;We had a referendum. Respect and trust should be at the heart of our system and that's what we did and Scotland voted emphatically to stay in the United Kingdom which I think was an affirmation of what a great country this is.

&quot;There isn't going to be another referendum. We had the referendum and the SNP aren't pushing for another referendum actually, Nicola Sturgeon said that vote in the general election was not about another referendum.
&quot;Now what we need to do is bring the United Kingdom together. We are going to do that by delivering the devolution settlement in Wales, delivering the devolution settlement in Scotland, keeping all the pledges that were made.&quot;

Speaking after taking part in commemorations of the 70th anniversary of VE Day, he said: &quot;That's one of the things this Government should be about: the idea of renewing and refreshing the United Kingdom.
&quot;And today is a good day to remember just what the United Kingdom stands for and what it has done. The United Kingdom stood alone against Hitler. That's what these people did.&quot;
Meanwhile, Russian observers claim the SNP’s massive success in the General Election is further evidence that last September’s referendum was a rigged.
Vladimir Churov, the country’s top election official, at the weekend called for an investigation into the vote which had been monitored at the time by Russia.
He said of the General Election result: “It confirms our position – that the outcome of the independence referendum in Scotland was a total falsification.”

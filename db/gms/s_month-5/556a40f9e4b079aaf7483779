AROUND 40 firefighters have been tackling a basement fire in Glasgow city centre.
Crews were called to West Nile Street at around 2pm and surrounding buildings, including bars and businesses, were evacuated during the incident.
One person was injured, thought to have suffered an electric shock, and was taken to hospital with concussion.
The fire service said the location of the fire in a small space meant a high number of officers were required to rotate crews.
It has now been extinguished but officers remain at the scene.
A fire service spokesman said: &quot;On arrival the Incident Commander was faced with a basement fire within 45 West Nile Street, because of the danger associated with this type of incident further resources were mobilised.
&quot;A total of four fire appliances and three specialist fire appliances attended and at the height of the fire 40 firefighters battled the blaze to bring it under control using two large bore firefighting jets.
&quot;Crews carried out a systematic search of number 45 West Nile Street and surrounding premises. One casualty was treated by the Scottish Ambulance Service and taken to Hospital for suspected concussion.
&quot;The fire has now been extinguished and firefighters will remain at the scene for some time to continue with damping down operations.&quot;

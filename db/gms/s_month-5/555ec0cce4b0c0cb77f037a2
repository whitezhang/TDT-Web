DRUGS which are feared to have landed five students in hospital are sold in shops across Glasgow, the Evening Times can reveal.An Evening Times investigation has found that synthetic cannabinoids - including dangerous Spice - are on sale in the city for around &pound;20 per three grams.Although now banned, shopkeepers and online retailers are still selling Spice and similar drugs.Five students at Lancaster University, were rushed to hospital after taking the cannabis-like drug earlier this week.Two people were still in hospital yesterday and medics described their condition as &quot;critical&quot;.Some of the shops - which the Evening Times have decided not to name - specialise in selling smoking accessories and have a variety on packets on offer, marked &quot;not for human consumption&quot;.Inspector Gavin Smith said: &quot;I would urge anyone who is offered synthetic cannabis to refuse - it can result in serious health implications.&quot;As many synthetic cannabinoids are new, they can have completely unknown effects in addition to the normal risks associated with cannabis use.&quot;We are looking to establish if this is a trend among young people in our area and will be taking action against those who sell illegal drugs.&quot;Before it was made illegal, Spice, also known as Spice Gold, Spice Silver, Spice Diamond, Spice Yucatan Fire, Solar Flare or Space Trucking, was openly sold in &quot;head shops&quot; across the country.Despite being outlawed in 2009, Spice can still easily be bought on the internet - and in some city stores - in pouches for around &pound;20.Police believe China and the Far East are the main areas for production of synthetic cannabinoids.Charity DrugScope said Spice is a collection of herbs or plant material which has been sprayed with synthetic cannabinoids.These substances produce a &quot;cannabis-like&quot; effect when smoked.However, side effects include an increased pulse rate, dry mouth, dizziness, agitation and paranoia.Drugs experts warned substances like Spice can be up to 10 times stronger than cannabis plants - with users having &quot;no idea&quot; of the potency of what they are buying.

TWO young men with special needs are carving out a career in the construction industry thanks to a city council scheme.Kevin McCarron and Adam Gibbs, who are both 23, were employed at City Building's Strathclyde Blindcraft Industries when they left school and got apprenticeships in joinery and carpentry.They have both been provided with the resources they need to progress through their apprenticeships including a dedicated learning support worker and training officer.City Building is one of Glasgow City Council's arm's length organisations.Kevin said: &quot;I never thought when attending an additional support school I would ever have the opportunity to be an apprentice joiner.&quot;This will change my life forever and after my apprenticeship I will have more choices in life.&quot;Adam added: &quot;I have had a great experience so far working with City Building and attending the learning centre. The support I have received has really helped motivate me to succeed.&quot;Kevin is working as a joiner on the investment and refurbishment side of the business while Adam has been working on carpentry projects on the firm's new house building site at Croftfoot Road.Since 2009, the council has secured around 3370 apprenticeship placements. The figure was released to help celebrate Scottish Apprenticeship Week.A council spokesman said: &quot;Dealing with youth unemployment is a key priority and offering and finding apprenticeship opportunities is an ideal way to tackle the issue.&quot;The role apprenticeships play in growing the skill-base in Glasgow and the value to our local economy cannot be underestimated.&quot;During this week, staff and apprentices will be attending a number of events including information days run by Glasgow Clyde College and school career events.

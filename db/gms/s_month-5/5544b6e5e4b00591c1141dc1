Over the moon, excited and relieved - how the royal super fans who have been camping outside the Lindo Wing feel about the latest stage of the "Great Kate Wait".The dedicated royalists have been sleeping in tents or on camp beds on the pavement outside the hospital for several days now and are delighted that the Duchess of Cambridge is in labour.Terry Hutt, who celebrated his 80th birthday this week and is from Weston-super-Mare, said: &quot;I'm so excited that I can't talk to you all that much.&quot;It's been a long wait but it's all been worth it.&quot;Mr Hutt received a cake and card from Kensington Palace on his birthday.Kathy Martin, 52, and originally from Australia, said she knew last night it was going to happen.&quot;There's no words to describe it. If she had a little girl, it'd be beautiful,&quot; she said.Amy Thompson, 14, from Newcastle, said: &quot;We woke up this morning and we seen that there were police all around, and we knew that there was something happening.&quot;She added that it &quot;just makes us feel so relieved because the wait's over now&quot;.Maria Scott, 44, also from Newcastle, said she was &quot;ecstatic&quot;, adding: &quot;I'm over the moon that she's in there. I've been here 13 days today. I'm so happy.&quot;She said it is &quot;just as exciting&quot; as when Prince George was born.Damian Andrews, 42, from Blackpool, said there is a clear change in the atmosphere outside the Lindo Wing. He said it felt &quot;happier&quot;, adding: &quot;I'm very excited.&quot; Jacquie Knighton, 56, said she is &quot;so excited&quot;.Later, a group of rugby fans from France arrived and caused a stir as they sang their team's song.The group from Toulon brought a bizarre twist to proceedings and caught the eyes - and ears - of the growing press pack.They are in London to see their team play tonight and are staying in a nearby hotel.Philippe Daniel, 44, said he is &quot;not especially&quot; a royal fan, but added: &quot;There is no royal family in France so the English royal family is ours.&quot;He also said people from Toulon love England due to rugby star Jonny Wilkinson having played for their team.At first, onlookers had no idea who the group were when they sang their song dressed in their team's colours.

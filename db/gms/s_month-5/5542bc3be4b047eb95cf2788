A PUPIL from Eastwood High got the chance to be a spy for the day and to visit MI5 headquarters when he won a Blue Peter competition.Jamie Dougall, 13, outwitted contestants from across the UK to code break and overcome mental and physical challenges to scoop one of three places as a CBBC Intelligence Officer.And as part of his prize he paid a special visit to MI5 HQ in London where he met the Director General of MI5, Andrew Parker.The visit was broadcast on Blue Peter and on NBC Good Morning programme in America as it was the first time television cameras had ever been allowed to film inside Thames House.Talking about his experience Jamie said: &quot;It was really cool and exciting. We were the first people to be allowed inside MI5 HQ for a tour. I enjoyed taking part in all the challenges which included flying in a helicopter, completing a treasure hunt in Manchester and undertaking an observation challenge where we had to look for suspicious things in the city. I like reading spy books by Anthony Horowitz and watching James Bond films and this experience has made me want to work for MI5.&quot;Eastwood High headteacher Stuart Maxwell said: &quot;Everyone at Eastwood High and Jamie's family are extremely proud of his achievements.&quot;

AN appeal has been launched for information to help find two missing Edinburgh teenagers after Police Scotland voiced concern for their welfare.
Elise Thomson, 13, and Kia Howett, 14, who are both believed to be in each other’s company, were last seen separately on Monday.
Elise was last seen in the Charterhall Grove area of Edinburgh. She is described as white girl with a slim build and around 5ft 4ins tall. She has long brown hair, and was wearing skinny jeans and white trainers.
Kia was last seen in the Sleigh Drive area of the city. She is described as a white girl with a slim build, who is around 4ft 10ins tall. No details of her clothing are available.
Inspector Stephen Rosie said: “ Whilst we believe both girls are in each others company, we are growing increasingly concerned for their welfare as there has been no contact with them since they were last seen by their families on the 11th May&quot;.
“Anyone who may have seen them, or who knows where they are please, is urged to contact police as soon as possible.”
Anyone with information is asked to contact Police Scotland immediately on 101 or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 55 111.

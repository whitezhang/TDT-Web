Glasgow-based beer brewer WEST is to open a new bar and restaurant outlet in the west end of Glasgow.
The new outlet, the brewers second, will open on May 8 in what was The Halt bar on the corner on Woodlands Road and will trade as WEST on the Corner.
WEST also operates an existing outlet at Templeton Building at Glasgow Green in the east end of the city which opened nine years ago.
The company said the launch of the new outlet, which follows four months of refurbishment work, follows the success of its pop-up bar on the premises last summer.
The outlet has been refurbished to a 120 seater bar and restaurant with open kitchen and will stock “at least 10 draft WEST beers”.
WEST owner Petra Wetzel said: “I believe we have given 160 Woodlands Road a second lease of life.
“The new lay-out and offering is very much what myself, my family and my friends seek out when socialising.
“I wanted to create a place that we would all love as much as the original WEST on Glasgow Green.
“Woodlands Road was my home as a student at Glasgow University and I am thrilled that people in the local area - and from further afield - now have an alternative WEST in the West End.
“A versatile and laid back bar and restaurant, it’s the perfect spot to pop in for a coffee, have a pint, grab a quick bite or stay for a full three course meal.
“And with children and dogs also welcome, it’s a great place for everyone to get together.”
WEST, the trading name of NOAH Beers, is currently adding a new &pound;4 million state-of-the-art brewery at its existing Glasgow Green base in the former Templeton's Carpet Factory, which will increase capacity 10-fold when it opens in the autumn.

ELDERLY residents in Glasgow are fighting the closure of their "lifeline" community hall.People living in retirement homes in Scotstoun are devastated by the planned closure of their centre - which is nicknamed the Dome.The centre and the housing is owned by Yoker Housing Association. The centre's service was being funded by Glasgow City Council.However, due to cuts it is likely to shut for good on June 30.The users are to run the Dome themselves.But they are looking for help with funding and setting up a committee.Great-grandma-of-five Margaret Logan, 76, has been coming to the Dome for nearly 30 years.She said: &quot;This is a big part of our life.&quot;Some people wouldn't see anyone at all if it wasn't for our hall.&quot;We have social nights, we have bingo, we have everyone coming in - great grandchildren and people from the mainstream community.&quot;Margaret Rennie, 57, said she was worried about the impact the closure would have on her health.She said: &quot;I had severe depression before I moved here, I never went anywhere. I couldn't speak to people.&quot;I was worried about coming here at first but they made me feel welcome.&quot;Now I don't know what I'd do without it. You come away from here with a smile on your face.&quot;I'm really frightened about what will happen if the centre closes.&quot;Anne McGillen, 80, said: &quot;I come in the mornings and it's really good to have it close by to my home.&quot;I'd like to see it stay open for the next generation.&quot;Roseanne Smith, 86, said: &quot;I'm in the house most of the time on oxygen aUser Anne O'Neil added: &quot;We just want to keep it open, it's a lifeline.&quot;It means the likes of wee Annie and Margaret can see people.&quot;They have nothing. And we just want to continue what we have.&quot;&quot;We're trying to get help to run it, we just need funding.&quot;Garscadden/Scotstounhill Councillor Graeme Hendry said: &quot;The local residents deserve enormous credit for getting together and trying to save the Dome. It's closure is a consequence of Labour's decision to slash funding to these much needed support services.&quot;I will continue to offer whatever support I can to residents in their bid to take over this service and would urge anyone who can support them to get in touch.&quot;Yoker Housing Association refused to comment.

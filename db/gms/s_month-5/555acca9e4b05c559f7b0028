IN his spare time Malcolm Moy enjoys nothing more than working with wild lions in Africa.And while he is equally passionate about his job in Glasgow, it couldn't be further removed from his work in the game park.Today Malcolm, 68, retires from his post as livestock supervisor at Pollok Country Park.Since 1997, he has been responsible for Glasgow's award winning Highland cattle, which unlike other cows, live in groups called folds and not herds.Over the years, he has been responsible for delivering hundreds of calves who quickly became firm favourites with visitors to the park.Most have come into the world in the relative comfort of a barn on the estate but some of the mums have been so anxious to see their new arrival they have gone into labour earlier than expected.That has resulted in Malcolm delivering calves in driving rain, howling wind and snowstorms.He said: &quot;It wasn't a 9am to 5pm job as I had to be on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&quot;It is something you have to put your heart and soul into - it is a vocation.On occasions, Malcolm would take extreme action to ensure the safety of the creatures in his care.During one period of heavy rain and severe flooding, he was forced to tie a rope round his waist and wrap the other end round a tree so he could safely wade through atrocious conditions to save a young calf.He said: &quot;I had to do that because there was only me about most of the time.&quot;In October 2011 Malcolm also had to deal with a group of cattle which caused chaos in the South Side after escaping from their Pollok field.The six beasts broke free and enjoyed a two-mile rampage before being recaptured by park rangers, police and the fire service after damaging several cars.Shocked locals watched the cattle make their way to Queen's Park and on to Battlefield roundabout.One bull entered a National Tyres garage, damaging several cars before being cornered by police.One eye witness said: &quot;Not often you see Highland cows running through Shawlands followed by two fire engines.&quot;Malcolm, 68, revealed he had a dream when he first arrived in Pollok and was given responsibility for the HIghland cattle.He said: &quot;In the early days, my ambition was for Pollok to be a force which would be recognised in the exhibition world.&quot;The animal lover achieved his dream and the magnificent animals in the park are now regarded as cattle royalty.Malcolm said: &quot;On one occasion we went to the Royal Show in England where we had a champion, reserve champion, junior champion and a second prize with a bull.&quot;In 2005, we were supreme champion at the Royal Highland Show in Ingleston with a dun coloured cow which had never happened before.&quot;However, his greatest reward has been introducing the people of the city to the proud cattle which belong to them.He said: &quot;I tried to make the people of Glasgow proud of their cattle,&quot;Malcolm's dedication to duty has been recognised by his bosses at the city council on more than one occasion.In 2004, he was presented with a medal by the then Lord Provost for his services to the people of Glasgow and next spring a tree bearing a plaque carrying his name will be planted in Pollok Park ensuring Malcolm's memory will live on for many decades to come.He said: &quot;Of course I will miss the cattle but I will not miss the weather some nights when I had to go out or wondering if I was going to get called out.&quot;As well as caring for the Highland cows, Malcolm and his wife Lesley have had their own menagerie of dogs, cats, pigeons, horses, goats, rare sheep and aviary bred birds.But it is bigger cats which have proved a real fascination for the couple in recent years.They have travelled to Africa 15 times to work with the lions in some of the country's national parks.Malcolm said: &quot;I am able to identify lions by their whisker spots and can follow their footmarks and can tell the difference between a lion, leopard and cheetah.&quot;On his retiral, Malcolm and Lesley had hoped to spend more time in Africa but will be forced to remain close to home as Lesley has developed a serious medical condition.He said: &quot;We did plan to help with the problem suffered by the farmers who lose a lot of their cattle to lions but Lesley is having to fight cancer so we feel our dream has been taken away from us.&quot;Malcolm has nothing but praise for his wife who has helped him cope with the more extreme conditions he has had to face in his career.He said: &quot;She has been 100% behind me the 33 years we have been together and has had to endure my problems. But when I come in after being called out in the middle of the night she is up getting me tea.&quot;The couple's plans to head back to Africa may be on hold but Malcolm is very clear about his future.He said: &quot;I don't want to sit and do nothing.&quot;Lord Provost Sadie Docherty said: &quot;Malcolm Moy is an institution at Pollok Park. He was devoted to the cattle and won numerous awards for the city.&quot;He really went beyond the call of duty to care for these animals and I along with the rest of the council wish him and his wife well.&quot;

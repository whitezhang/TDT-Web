THRIFTY fashion fans will descend on Merchant city to raise cash for a women's charity.Glasgow Women's Aid is to host a clothes swap in the city centre's trendy Metropolitan cocktail bar on Thursday.The event, aimed at raising money for the organisation, will see dozens of women in attendance hoping to grab a bargain and get rid of unwanted items.The concept involves swapping clothes, accessories and shoes you no longer wear for something more appealing brought by another attendee for free - the only cost is a &pound;5 entry fee.Swappers will be sipping cocktails and snacking on cupcakes throughout the night while supporting the charity.Fiona Davies, of Glasgow Women's Aid, said: &quot;We are really excited about our first ever Clothes Swap Party.&quot;We are trying to come up with new and exciting ideas for fundraising and awareness raising and hope that everyone enjoys this fun event.&quot;Fundraising is vital to the continuation of Glasgow Women's Aid so events such as this are so important to bring in much needed money to support our work with women, children and young people.&quot;It is also a good way of informing women about our service so they know where to come if they need support around domestic abuse.&quot;Due to the high level of interest in the event, staff have asked that visitors only bring one bag of clothes, shoes and accessories with them although people are still welcome to attend with no donations.Chocolate lovers can also try their luck in the charity's raffle for the chance to win a super-sized treat.One lucky winner, to be announced on the night, will get their hands on a 4.5kg Toblerone bar if they buy a raffle ticket.As previously reported in the Evening Times, the charity has been helping women, children and young people who have been victims of domestic abuse for more than 35 years.They help abuse victims to find emergency accommodation, provide information and help to support them.More information can be found at www.glasgowwomensaid.org.uk or searching for 'GWA Clothes Swap' on Facebook.

A 34-year-old man has admitted sexually assaulting a woman on a flight to Turkey.
 Andrew Tosh, from Dundee , was arrested when the flight from Glasgow to Dalaman was forced to land in Gatwick after the pilot and cabin crew were left concerned at his behaviour. 
 Cabin crew then asked fellow passengers if they would help restrain him if things got out of hand.
Tosh admitted being drunk on an aircraft, threatening behaviour, sexual assault and assault when he appeared at court.
He was released on conditional bail and ordered to attend Lewes Crown Court on June 11 for a hearing. 

Passenger Jimmy Costello told the Evening Telegraph he had to step in to help restrain Tosh.
He said: “The cabin crew started moving the people who were seating behind him and they spoke to him, trying to keep him calm.
“People were saying that he was a bad flyer and that he got really nervous. It was arranged to divert the plane. As we were coming down he was shouting that we were going to crash.
“It was an all female cabin crew and they had asked if I would help them to restrain the passenger if things got out of hand.
“I held his wrists against his chest and I held him down until the plane landed.”

PARLIAMENT has its youngest MP in centuries after Mhairi Black, SNP member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, was officially sworn in.
The 20-year-old, who is studying politics, opted to affirm as she joined others in completing the swearing-in process ahead of next week’s State Opening of Parliament.
Ms Black’s SNP colleagues Ian Blackford - MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber - and Lanark and Hamilton East MP Angela Crawley completed the formalities before she arrived at the despatch box.
She stated: “I, Mhairi Black, Paisley and Renfrewshire South, do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law.”
Europe minister David Lidington was the first MP to swear in today and was closely followed by new Energy Secretary Amber Rudd.
A number of SNPs also took the oath in Gaelic - Drew Hendry, Carol Monaghan, Deidre Brock, Chris Law, John Nicolson and Angus MacNeil, who also took the oath in Irish. 
Some politicians elected to take the oath in Welsh or Cornish while a number of SNP MPs including Neil Gray and Philippa Whitford took the oath in ‘the Scottish manner’.

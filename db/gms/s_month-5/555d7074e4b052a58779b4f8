THOUSANDS of Loyalist marchers will bring Glasgow to a standstill when they invade the city centre this weekend.More than 4500 members of the Apprentice Boys of Derry, who have travelled from all over the UK, will descend on the city on Saturday.And the procession is expected to cause widespread disruption to traffic as it winds its way through several busy areas.Dozens of extra police officers will be drafted in to keep order as more than 50 bands march amid tight security.Hundreds more spectators are expected to throng the streets of Glasgow to watch as the thousands of marchers make their way to Glasgow Green.Meanwhile, a top police commander has warned that officers will crack down on any troublemakers at the procession on Saturday.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland said: &quot;My priority is to make sure the procession - one of the biggest of its kind - passes peacefully, with the safety of those taking part, members of the public and officers, being paramount.&quot;There are significant plans in place to minimise the disruption for people who live, work and will visit Glasgow city centre.&quot;However, during the event, traffic will be heavily disrupted.&quot;If possible, I would ask that motorists avoid travelling through the city centre or allow more time for their journey on Saturday afternoon.&quot;I understand that it is not the people taking part in the procession who may cause trouble but an unwelcome minority who turn up and use the event as an excuse to drink alcohol, and behave in a manner which will not be tolerated.&quot;These are the people that my officers and I will focus on. We will target any violence, disorder and anti-social behaviour.&quot;The Apprentice Boys of Derry march takes place in different cities throughout the UK, with marchers following a local lead band.In recent years, the march has been held in Newcastle, Perth, Stirling, Inverness and Belfast.The Apprentice Boys were set up to commemorate the 1689 Siege of Derry, which lasted 105 days and claimed more than 10,000 lives.The march falls on the same day as the Scottish Premiership play-off semi-final between Hibernian and Rangers, although the game is being played in Edinburgh - meaning there should be no delays for most Light Blue fans.Earlier this month, we told how a loyalist march was forced to change its route following police fears of serious disorder and violence.The Regimental Blues wanted to hold a procession starting on Garnock Street, travelling along Royston Road, High Street, Gallowgate and London Road finishing in Tullis Street.Representatives of the organisation said it had chosen the route to break down the barriers which are traditionally associated with certain areas of the city and their respective attachment to Republican or Loyalist causes.But police objected to the route saying it posed a high risk of public disorder which could only be contained with a substantial police presence.The march was held on Saturday May 9 after the matter was referred to Glasgow City Council's public petitions committee for a decision.

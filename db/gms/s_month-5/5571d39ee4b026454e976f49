PROFESSIONAL hitmen have no feelings or emotions when they kill, &shy;according to a study of the &shy;underworld.
&shy;Professor David Wilson says assassins – like Edward Fox’s &shy;hitman in Day of the Jackal – &shy;consider themselves businessmen doing a normal job and &shy;simply switch off when they pull the trigger.
In research published last week, the criminologist reveals &shy;contract &shy;killing is becoming increasingly competitive.
As a result, professionals are hired for an average &pound;3500. Wilson added: “What we’re trying to do is to understand how someone becomes a hitman.
“How they put themselves into the right psychological state to kill. Often they have been violent prior to becoming hitmen or have already killed.
“They’re like you and me, they take pride in their work. It’s not just a skill to inflict harm on &shy;people.
“It is also psychological skill – to see the victim as business rather than a human being.”
He believes two of &shy;Scotland’s unsolved murders were carried out by experienced contract killers –known as &shy;master hitmen.
One was the murder of banker Alistair Wilson, in Nairn, in 2002 – shot outside his home – and the other, gangster Frank McPhie, who was shot by a sniper in &shy;Glasgow, in 2000.
Wilson said: “The master &shy;hitman doesn’t care what &shy;happens to the body afterwards. His job is to kill.”
It is hoped the research will help police investigations.

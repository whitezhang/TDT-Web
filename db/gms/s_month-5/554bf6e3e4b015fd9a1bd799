A PROBE is to be launched after an alleged voting fraud in Glasgow East.&nbsp;Council staff received reports of an alleged impersonation in the constituency after a voter turned up to the polling station, but had already been registered as voting that day.The ballot box containing the alleged fraudulent vote will be seized on arrival at the Emirates Arena, where the count is taking place this evening.Staff are aware of which ballot paper they are looking for and are on stand-by for when the box arrives.A spokesman from Glasgow City Council said: &quot;We have been informed of an alleged impersonation in Glasgow East.&quot;The police have been informed and when the relevant ballot paper arrives staff will put on blue police evidence gloves.&quot;It will be counted, it will be entered into the count, but it will then be put into an evidence bag and handed to the police which will then form part of an investigation.&quot;Someone came along and voted with that ballot paper, and shortly after that someone came along with the same name as somebody who has already voted.&quot;

 A plane was forced to make an emergency landing at a Scots airport today. 
The Scandinavian Airlines System’s flight was en route from Dublin to Oslo when it was hit by cabin pressure problems.
 The pilot of the Boeing 737-800, which can hold more than 180 passengers, requested an emergency landing as he flew across the Prestwick area. 
Emergency services were on standby but the flight landed safely at Aberdeen International Airport at 1.40pm.
An airline spokeswoman said: “SK4604 was diverted due to cabin pressure changes and landed according to procedure.”

A BOGUS lawyer who helps gangsters keep their dirty cash is defending a twisted paedophile in a &pound;10,000 crime profits case.
Convicted fraudster Jim McDonald has been hired by child rapist John McCallum, who is currently serving 10 years for abusing his twin nieces.
Armed police swooped on McCallum’s home in Straiton, Midlothian, in April 2013 to search for drugs and guns.
Instead officers found &pound;10,000 cash – which McDonald claims came from a bed firm run by McCallum’s wife Nicola.
McCallum, 55, was jailed the same year for subjecting twins Rachel Steadwood and Tracy Brown to sordid attacks when they were aged between five and 13.
Prosecutors attempted to have McDonald, 67, thrown off the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) case at Edinburgh Sheriff Court last week.
But a sheriff ruled he could continue to act for the couple and set another hearing for August.
Outside court, McDonald met hood client Russell Stirton – linked to the McGovern crime clan – to discuss his own POCA battle.
McDonald said prosecutors were acting outside the law. He told the Record: “They don’t want it exposed that for years they’ve been taking people’s money unlawfully.
“The &pound;10,000 belonged to Mrs McCallum.”

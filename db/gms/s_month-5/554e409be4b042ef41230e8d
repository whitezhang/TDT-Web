A MAN was left with head wounds after being attacked in a barber shop, police said.

The man, 29, needed hospital treatment after the assault, which happened in Gary’s Barber Shop in Springburn Way in Glasgow.
Police Scotland say the motive for the attack is not yet known.
The victim was inside the premises on Thursday afternoon when two men came into the shop and approached him.
One of the men then carried out the assault, before the pair left the shop, got in to a vehicle and drove off.
The injured man received treatment for head lacerations at Glasgow Royal Infirmary.
Police have been carrying out door to door inquiries and are reviewing CCTV footage from the area.
Detective Sergeant Michael McCullagh said: “The motive for this attack remains unknown and I am appealing to anyone who was in the area at the time of the incident, who may have seen the two men fleeing the shop, to contact us.
“We are still reviewing CCTV images in the hope that further information can be gleaned about this attack but I would urge people to please get in touch with us - what you saw or noticed may seem insignificant to you but it could help us piece together elements of this investigation and lead us to tracing those responsible for this crime.”

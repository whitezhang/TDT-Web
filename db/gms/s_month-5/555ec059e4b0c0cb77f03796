MORE than 80 medical professionals have warned cancer patients in Glasgow could be put at risk in a shake-up of services across the city.Doctors at the Beatson cancer centre have called for &quot;urgent action&quot; to be taken to address the &quot;desperate&quot; situation they claim patients are facing due to the creation of the new South Glasgow University Hospital.In a letter to health minister Shona Robison, they raise fears that the changes will see junior doctors left in charge out of hours at the Beatson and warn that there is inadequate staffing to resuscitate patients in the event of emergencies.The medics say they will be unable to continue to admit patients unless urgent action is taken.The letter states: &quot;The removal of acute medical support services from this site will be complete by the end of next week. We believe this poses significant risks to patient safety.&quot;It goes on to say that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) has refused their requests for an external inspection to take place looking at the safety issues.The doctors also state: &quot;This is a desperate situation which we have done our utmost to avoid but we now find ourselves, our patients and the cancer service for more than half of Scotland faced with very immediate risks.&quot;A spokeswoman for NHSGGC said the health board &quot;would never implement any change that puts the safety of our patients at risk&quot;.She added: &quot;We acknowledge their concerns and have been working to put in place actions in the immediate short term that address the concerns raised. Unfortunately this has taken longer than we would have wished or expected.&quot;Following a meeting with the consultants last Thursday a letter has been sent to all consultants at the Beatson this morning that sets out the actions we have agreed to take forward with them and confirming a further meeting with them next week.&quot;

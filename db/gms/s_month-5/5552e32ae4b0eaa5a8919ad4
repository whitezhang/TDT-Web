THE SCOTTISH champion of Perudo is hoping his numbers come up at a national heat in Glasgow tonight.(WEDS)Mark Hall, 30, from Glasgow's west end, won the Scottish heat last year and is returning to fight for his crown in the Citizen Hotel.He is among around 30 players at the Scottish championships of the South American liar dice game, with the winner going forward to the UK final in London in November.Mark, a GP, got into the game around 10 years ago.He explained: &quot;There are up to eight players and we sit round a table and shake five dice in a cup. You can see how your own dice have landed but not anyone else's. You bet on what you think the number is everyone else has showing in total.&quot;So I would say there are four threes, someone else goes higher and everyone keeps going higher until you call someone a liar, that the total can't be that high.&quot;It's like a kind of poker. It's all about bluffing.&quot;Once a 'liar' is called, the dice are revealed and, if the total is lower than the 'liar' the person who 'called' it loses a dice. Otherwise, the 'liar' loses a dice. The winner is the person with the most dice left at the end.Mark said he and a group of friends meet up to play the game once or twice a month.He added: &quot;We had a friend who taught us and we meet up with a couple of beers. It doesn't need a lot of practice!&quot;The game, which featured in the Pirates of the Caribbean, when Johnny Depp played for his life, originated in Peru.Mark said his strategy for tonight's final was all about &quot;gentle intimidation of your opponents and keeping a good poker face.&quot;He said: &quot;It's about getting an advantage over them and making them nervous!&quot;Each game takes from 30 minutes to an hour and two winners from each table go on to play the winners from others before a champion is crowned.Mark said the open championships were open to players from across Scotland and there were no qualifying heats.&quot;It's very casual,&quot; he said.This year marks the 26th year Perudo has been played, with clubs established around the world.Keen Perudo players can register to play in the Scottish qualifier at www.perudoworldchamps.co.uk.Regional qualifiers will also take place in Southampton this month and in London in September.

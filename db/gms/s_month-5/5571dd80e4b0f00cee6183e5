A CRAZED killer who murdered a prostitute and raped two other women beside her corpse has been jailed for 22 years.
Steven Mathieson carried out the horrendous attacks while his partner was on a night out - and his four year old son was sleeping in the next room.
His tragic victim, Luciana Maurer, had only been in Scotland for a few days when he lured her to his house in Falkirk and stabbed her 44 times.
This morning at Livingston High Court he was sentenced to life imprisonment having already plead guilty on April 2.
He also pled guilty to the sexual assault of two other women at the house in Springfield Drive last December.
 

Detective Inspector David Pinkney, of the Major Investigation Team, said: &quot;These women were subject to a brutal and depraved attack which has been extremely traumatic for them, their families and the wider community.
&quot;I'd like to commend the bravery of the two young women and Luciana's family throughout the investigation, and thank them for their assistance with our enquiries.&quot;
He added: &quot;Police Scotland welcome this sentence and although nothing can undo Mathieson's actions that night, I hope that this will give his victims and all those affected by his crimes some sense of closure.&quot;

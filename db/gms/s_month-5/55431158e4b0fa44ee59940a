A PETITION has been launched in a bid to have the Commonwealth Games Big G logo given a permanent home in the East End.Earlier this year, the city council revealed the 3D sculpture, which took pride of place in George Square during the sporting event, is to be erected outside Kelvingrove Art Gallery which gets around a million visitors a year.But Calton resident Jennifer Payne has set up a petition calling for it to be located in Calton's Barrowland Park.It says: &quot;The Big G, which provided the backdrop for countless selfies and other images during the Games, should be a permanent part of the Glasgow landscape, positioned in the East End, to recognise the regeneration of Glasgow's East End.&quot;This would create a new tourist destination at Glasgow Cross, the original city centre of Glasgow.&quot;By positioning the Big G in Barrowland Park, which requires permanent status as a public common space, Glasgow City Council could continue to encourage community participation that helps to make our city healthier, greener and more prosperous for all of our citizens.&quot;Ms Payne said the East End is an area which has traditionally been blighted by unemployment, crime and lack of investment.However, the Games had helped the regeneration of the area and boosted the economy by creating jobs and modern apprenticeships.She added: &quot;Why then, is Glasgow City Council planing to position the Big G, one of the most popular lasting symbols of the Commonwealth Games, anywhere other than the East End.&quot;This is not about East versus West in Glasgow. This is about right and wrong.&quot;I think it is right to position the Big G in the East End to recognise the importance of the East End to the City of Glasgow and create a new tourist destination at Glasgow Cross which was the original city centre of Glasgow and now serves as the gateway to the East End.&quot;The petition currently has 15 signatures but needs a minimum of 25 before it can be considered by the council's public petitions committee.A spokesman said: &quot;The council's position is that the Big G will be sited in Kelvingrove Park, one of Scotland's most popular visitor destinations.&quot;However, a petition has been received requesting that the Big G be alternatively sited in Barrowland Park.&quot;Should this petition receive sufficient support in line with our rules on petitions, it will be considered in due course.&quot;

MORE than eight out of ten people do not trust politicians according to our election survey.Of those asked do you trust politicians 82% said No with only 18% stating yes they did trust politicians.With the party leaders on TV and in the papers promising a raft of changes if they are elected it seems few have much faith in them to deliver on their promises.Of the 620 people who answered the question 510 said they did not trust those elected to look after our interests.Only 110 said yes they did trust them.Dr Neil McGarvey of Strathclyde University said politicians traditionally had a low trust rating. He said: &quot; Politicians are like lawyers and estate agents when it comes to people's trust.&quot;However he said the perception was about the profession in a general sense.He added: &quot;If you were to add in specific politicians' names you might get a different answer.&quot;Richard Newman, director of Body Talk who analyses body language and communication skills of leaders in politics and business, said trust was a central issue in this election. And politicians are aware of the ricks to appear trustworthy.He said television appearances for leaders are of the utmost importance in appearing trustworthy.He said: &quot;When we are searching for someone we can trust, who indistinct from everyone else, it is essential to have a full range of communication skills to influence and inspire us, in order to avoid appearing bland or false.He looked at the three UK party leaders, David Cameron Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg during their recent Question Time performances.He said Mr Cameron can appear &quot;too heated&quot; Mr Miliband has a narrow range of techniques which he over uses and Mr Clegg displays &quot;empathy but voters then felt let down after his tuition fees pledge.He added: If we see a leader convince one sceptic and gain a nodding head from then we feel more reassured and convinced that they have answered the question well and won people round.&quot;

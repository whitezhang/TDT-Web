HIDDEN Orchestra are to perform in Glasgow this summer almost a year since a serious motorway crash near Belgrade.The smash hospitalised their sound engineer, injured the drummer damaged most of their equipment and forced them to cancel over half of their remaining tour dates.The band is now back on the road and will take to tghe stage in Oran Mor on Byres Road on Monday June 8.Hidden Orchestra is the solo studio project of multi-instrumentalist composer/producer Joe Acheson. The music combines all the different musical traditions Joe has been involved in - years of Classical training, whilst at the same time playing in all manner of bands and ensembles, DJing and producing, and performing live improvised experimental music.By tapping into the energy of virtuoso drum solos and adding the elements of other music that are dark and beautiful, he creates Electronic music made with acoustic instruments, drums, field recordings and natural sounds - intense, beat-driven Classical textures with layers of energy, emotion and atmosphere.The live shows feature a core quartet of Joe Acheson on bass and electronics, with Poppy Ackroydon piano and violin, and Tim Lane and Jamie Graham on two full drum kits. Regular live guests include Phil Cardwell (trumpet) and a spectacular live audiovisual show by Lumen.

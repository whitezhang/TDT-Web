AN EXILED Motherwell fan was knocked back for play-off tickets – as his club insisted he was a Rangers supporter.
David Molloy, 73, who lives in Wakefield, Yorkshire, rang Fir Park on Wednesday to get tickets for the crunch clash with Rangers tomorrow.
But after giving his details, he was stunned to be told: “You’re a Rangers fan and we can’t sell tickets to Rangers fans.”
David said: “There is no way I’m a Rangers fan.
“I went to my first match with my dad in 1947 and Motherwell is my team. It really got to me.”
David manages to get to two or three Motherwell games a season.
But he feared he would be locked out as they defend a 3-1 lead from the Ibrox first leg to retain their status in the top tier.
Motherwell general manager Alan Burrows last night pledged to resolve the mix-up and confirmed he will arrange tickets for David.
Water technician David, originally from Bellshill, still wears the Motherwell scarf he bought in 1958 for a Scottish Cup match – against Rangers.
He was also at Hampden in 1991 when the Steelmen lifted the Scottish Cup and again in 2005 for the club’s League Cup triumph.
He added: “It annoyed me that somebody on the other end of a phone is making me out to be something I am not.”

PRE-SCHOOLERS in Drumchapel arrived for nursery on Monday morning to find vandals had destroyed their playground.The Drumchapel Family Learning Centre at St Claire's Primary School suffered damage at the hands of four youths late on Sunday night.Staff arrived on Monday morning to find that the children's wooden Hobbit House in the playground had been severely vandalised.The window was smashed, the door kicked-in and some of the pillows from inside were found scattered throughout the playground.The Head of Centre Fiona Crawley said: &quot;We were really saddened to find the Hobbit House had been broken into. It looks like someone has put their foot through the double glazing window, there was glass all over the floor.&quot;They have bust the door open as well. I can't understand why anyone would want to do that. It's used a place where the kids can sit and have a snack or have a story read to them. There's nothing of any value inside, just some pillows and children's paintings.&quot;The children understood what had happened, they would say 'we can't go out in the garden today because of the bad boys'.&quot;The Hobbit House cost &pound;180 and was built in 2010 with the help of some of the parents.Fiona is hopeful that the children will be able to use it again next week and that the perpetrators will be caught. She said: &quot;Hopefully some parents can help repair the damage that's be done, the double glazing window will be expensive to replace though.&quot;A grandparent of one of the children noticed four youths in the playground and reported it to the police and another parent said that they saw youths in the playground earlier in the evening.&quot;The cctv footage of the playground could only make out that the youths took the pillows from the house and used them to lay down in the playground.Police were unable to identify them from the footage and informed Fiona that they have requested local cctv footage in order to track their movements in the hope that they can be caught.

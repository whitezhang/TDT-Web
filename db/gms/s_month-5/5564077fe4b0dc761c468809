AN office where thousands of births, deaths and marriages were registered is to be flattened to make way for student flats.The property on Martha Street is part of a development which also includes the A listed Council Parish Halls on George Street.This week, city councillors will be asked to agree to sell a large part of a city block beside the City Chambers to CSG Glasgow for &pound;5.1million.The site , which is in the Glasgow Central conservation area, also includes former B listed council offices on George Street, offices and a council car park on John Street, two garages on North Frederick Street and a vacant site at the corner of George Street and John Street.The company, which is part of the Edinburgh based Chris Stewart Group, intends to redevelop the area to create 59 serviced apartments and 375 students flats in a new 10 storey building.A former stable block in the heart of the site will be redeveloped for bar, cafe or restaurant use.A report to councillors says: &quot;A key feature of the plan is the creation of a new lane linking John Street and North Frederick Street which will run parallel with George Street to the rear of the listed buildings.&quot;The creation of the lane will connect with pedestrian movement around the site and the adjacent Strathclyde University campus.&quot;The lane has the potential to become a vibrant new public space with its own identity.&quot;Plans for the site include retaining and refurbishing the listed buildings, adding a new build extension to the rear of 280 George Street and creating a new bar-restaurant on the ground floor of 266 George Street.The vacant site will be used for student accommodation with shops at ground floor level.Liz Cameron, the city council's jobs and the economy spokeswoman, said: &quot;If approved at committee, the development of the George Street complex will see new life for these key buildings in the heart of Glasgow.&quot;The proposed student accommodation, serviced apartments and retail and leisure uses meet identified needs in the city and the new lane will create a new nightlife destination.&quot;A spokesperson for the Chris Stewart Group said: &quot;This is an exciting development opportunity with the prospect of delivering a unique city centre environment.&quot;By harnessing the potential of the existing listed buildings and creating a new lane with its own identity, our plans are to open up the area for everyone to enjoy.&quot;The Chris Stewart Group is an independent and privately owned property development and investment business that specialises in complex city centre projects.In 2013, the company completed the Advocate's Close project, a &pound;46m regeneration of three medieval lanes in Edinburgh's Old Town to create a vibrant area including hotel, 50 serviced apartments, restaurants, bars and offices.

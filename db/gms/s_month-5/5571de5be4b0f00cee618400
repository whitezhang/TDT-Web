A TEENAGER has been questioned by police about an alleged bid to blackmail a footballer over a party where an underage girl was filmed having sex.
Detectives launched an inquiry after the Record revealed yesterday that the explicit video was being shared on social media.
 The 15-year-old girl at the centre of the sex tape storm was among the guests at a party held in Edinburgh city centre for the Mayweather – Pacquiao fight. 
It is claimed the teenager questioned by police uploaded a picture of the footballer and three girls on to Twitter and told the player he would tell the club about the party if he was not paid &pound;4000.
It’s understood detectives visited the teenager at his home in north Edinburgh on Monday night.
The Record have not named the footballer and a boxer who also attended the party on Saturday night because we understand they were unaware of any illicit activity.
The girl was filmed by several people having sex with an older man.
On Sunday evening, the video was shared across social media.
Last night, the girl, who we cannot name for legal reasons, was still receiving online abuse.
She was subjected to vile name-calling by supporters and friends of the sports stars involved.
A police source said last night: “Everyone we can trace who was at the party will be spoken to.
 “We would be remiss in our duty to this child if we didn’t question everyone present. It’s a serious  investigation with implications for those directly involved.”

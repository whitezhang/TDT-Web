ONE of four men accused of plotting to murder Johnny “Mad Dog” Adair was secretly recorded saying, “I’m trying to get a war started”, a court heard yesterday.
Police bugged Antoin Duffy’s home and heard him make the remark to his girlfriend, jurors were told.
Duffy allegedly came home from the Brazen Head pub in Glasgow on September 1, 2013, and told Stacey McAllister: “I’m trying to get a war started and get as many guns and explosives as I can.
“I need to get this Johnny Adair shot first, know what I mean.”
The day after, Duffy allegedly told Stacey: “I’ll just go and get and shoot people. Terrorism, but not to shoot civilians.
“I’m not asking for permission. I’m setting up on my own. I’ll do the IRA proud.”
Duffy, 39, Martin Hughes, 36, Paul Sands, 31 and John Gorman, 58 , deny conspiring to murder former Loyalist terror bosses Adair and Sam “Skelly” McCrory, who now live in Ayrshire.
It’s claimed Duffy told Hughes in a bugged conversation in August 2013: “We can stand with the best of them in history. This is the f****** bastard that killed 50 of our people.”
Hughes allegedly replied: “Have to get him before he gets ours.”
It was put to Adair earlier in the trial that his Ulster Freedom Fighters Unit, known as C Company, had murdered up to 40 Catholics during the Troubles.
He replied: “It’s been reported as that.”
Duffy and Gorman also deny plotting to murder the governor of Barlinnie prison in Glasgow with a car bomb.
Three other accused, Craig Convery, 37, Gary Convery, 34, and Gordon Brown, 29, - deny organised crime charges. The trial at the High Court in Glasgow continues.

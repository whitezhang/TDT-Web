A Roman Catholic priest will not face any criminal charges over allegations of historical sexual abuse after police found no evidence to support the claim.
Father Paul Morton was suspended from St Bride's parish in Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, in October while police investigated a complaint against him.
The Diocese of Motherwell said it had been told no charges would be brought.
Fr Morton will not return to ministry until he is formally approved by a canonical counsel.
St Bride's parish is part of the Diocese of Motherwell, headed by Bishop Joseph Toal.
A spokesman for the Diocese of Motherwell said: &quot;Bishop Toal met with Father Morton last week and learned that the police had found no evidence to corroborate the allegations made against him. 
&quot;They had therefore concluded their investigation and will not be bringing charges nor referring the case to the procurator fiscal. 
&quot;This information has now been confirmed to the Diocese by the police.&quot;
Bishop Toal advised Fr Morton that he would now seek canonical counsel.
&quot;We will all require to be patient during this process, which is the prescribed way to proceed,&quot; said Bishop Toal.
&quot;I pray that this case will quickly proceed to a just conclusion and we will be able to welcome Father Morton back to active ministry.&quot;

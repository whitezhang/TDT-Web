THE family of missing man John Murphy has said they are 'desperate' for him come to home.The Murphy family made the emotional plea for the 52-year-old's safe return yesterday as his disappearance is 'completely out of character'.Numerous members of the community have offered to help with a door to door search for landscape , which John plans to organise in the hope neighbours may be able to shed some light on his movements.Anna Murpy, Mr Murphy's mother, begged her to son to get in contact with someone if he could.The 76-year-old said: &quot;John if you are reading this could you please, please get in touch or phone if you can.&quot;Let us know you are okay.&quot;His younger sister, Sharon McNab, also wants to see her brother back 'where he belongs'.The 49-year-old said: &quot;When I heard he was missing I said 'What? What do you mean? He cannot be missing'.&quot;It just did not sink in, I cannot believe it.&quot;He is my brother, we all love him and we want him to back home - back with his family.&quot;Even if it is just a call to say he is okay, we just want to know he is safe.&quot;Alarm bells were raised on Tuesday evening after Mr Murphy failed to return home from work, his family then discovered he had not made it to his job as a landscaping supervisor at East Hall Housing Association that day.John, 24, said: &quot;My mum had run him a bath and was waiting on him coming in and he did not appear.&quot;She called his work phone a couple of times and eventually his boss answered and told her he had not come in that day.&quot;She called the hospital in case he felt unwell again, as he had been off sick last week and spent a night in the hospital for gastroenteritis, but he was not there so she called the police.&quot;Mr Murphy's wife Tricia, 49, said that the father of the five is a 'quiet, family man' who lives for his children and his beloved football team, Celtic.She added: &quot;He is very laid back.&quot;He does not go out a lot, if he goes anywhere it is to a concert or to a game.&quot;Pink Floyd is his band, he goes to the tribute nights and is a Celtic season holder but that is it.&quot;It's not like him to do this.&quot;Mr Murphy was believed to be wearing a beige t-shirt embroidered with East Hall's logo, a black jacket, black cargo trousers and black boots.The family have not heard from Mr Murphy in three days and are still not sure if he made the journey to work after leaving his home on Craigpark Drive in Dennistoun on Tuesday morning between 7am and 7.30am.John said: &quot;We know he left for work but we still do not even know if he left the area.&quot;We are frustrated to be honest.&quot;It has been three days he has been missing now and we do not know anything at all.&quot;We are trying to keep strong with it, my mum is staying strong.&quot;The local community and members of social networking sites have rallied around the family to offer their support which, John said, has been 'overwhelming'.Together, John's Facebook and Twitter appeals for his father's safe return have been shared more than 19,000 times.John said: &quot;I would like to thank everyone.&quot;I have posted on Facebook and Twitter and the response has been amazing.&quot;I would ask people to continue what they are doing and keep an eye out for anything.&quot;A spokesman for Police Scotland said: &quot;Enquiries into the whereabouts of John are still ongoing and we ask anyone with information to call 101.&quot;

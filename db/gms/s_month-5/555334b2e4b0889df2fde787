A banned driver who was caught behind the wheel of a car with both legs in plaster has been jailed for six months.
Richard McAlpine, 47, from Glasgow, had never re-taken his test after being handed a five-year driving ban for a previous offence in 2006.
Despite being on crutches after suffering two broken ankles in a fall, he was caught driving near Neilston, East Renfrewshire, on 27 May 2013.
At Paisley Sheriff Court, McAlpine was also given another five-year ban.
McAlpine had been banned from driving on two previous occasions in 2003 and 2006.
Jailing him, Sheriff Colin Pettigrew said: &quot;This is your third conviction for driving while disqualified and as such, there can only be one disposal here today.&quot;
The court heard how McAlpine had been at the home of a relative when he took the keys to his aunt's car and drove off following an argument.
Police were informed and stopped him a short time later.
McAlpine later admitted driving while disqualified for a third time and also pleaded guilty to having no insurance and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner by shouting, swearing and uttering threats.

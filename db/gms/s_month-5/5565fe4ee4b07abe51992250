 Dumbarton have confirmed the appointment of Stephen Aitken as their new manager, with the 38-year-old leaving Stranraer. 
 He has signed a contract until summer 2017 and replaces Ian Murray, who switched to St Mirren last week. 
 Dumbarton chief executive Gilbert Lawrie said: &quot;He was top of our list to come to Dumbarton and he arrives at the club with a terrific reputation. 
 &quot;We believe Stephen has the qualities to help us build and develop.&quot; 
 Lawrie added that he was &quot;grateful to the committee at Stranraer FC, whose co-operation was well received&quot;. 
 Former Greenock Morton, Stanraer, Stenhousemuir and Arthurlie midifelder Aitken had been in charge at Stair Park since October 2012. 
 Stanraer missed out on promotion this season, finishing second behind Greenock Morton in League One and losing to Forfar Athletic in the play-off semi-finals. 
 Aitken told Dumbarton's website: &quot;I can't wait to get started and I'm really looking forward to the challenge.&quot; 
 Murray steered Dumbarton to seventh place in the Championship and agreed to join St Mirren on a two-year deal last week. 
 Former Scotland international Murray, 34, had been with the Sons since November 2012, saving them from relegation in his first campaign and ending up fifth in 2013-14.

DUNCAN Weir is back from a long-term arm injury in time for Glasgow Warriors' push for a first-ever PRO12 title and he has warned Finn Russell to expect a fresh battle for the no10 jersey.
Russell leapfrogged Weir in the pecking order for club and country this season, but after spending nearly four months on the sidelines Weir - who was the Scotland hero this time last year for scoring a dramatic match-winning drop-goal in Italy - is ready to restore the fight.
 He will be named on the bench by Glasgow to face Ulster this weekend today but in this week's Daily Record Rugby Show he explains how he is looking to play a part in the exciting end-of-season play-offs and push for his Scotland place in the forthcoming Rugby World Cup. 
 

The Warriors face Ulster at Scotstoun on Saturday in front of their biggest-ever crowd for a regular league match - 10,000 - and a win would clinch a home semi-final against either Ospreys, Munster or Ulster.
Glasgow are currently tied on 70 points with Munster and the Welsh outfit, both previous winners, with Ulster on 69. Munster host the struggling Dragons while the Ospreys travel to Pat Lam's surprise packet of the year Connacht.
Draw or defeat could leave the Warriors facing an away trip to either Ospreys or Munster with Ulster's Ravenhill ground already granted the final, even if they fail to make it.

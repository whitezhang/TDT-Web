 GLASGOW WARRIORS star Euan Murray admits family has to come first after calling time on his Scotland career. 
The 34-year-old is the Dark Blues most capped prop and his decision not to put himself forward for this year’s World Cup selection hasn’t been taken lightly.
 Murray earned his last cap against Ireland in this season’s Six Nations whitewash and will hold talks with his Scotstoun club about his future in the coming weeks but he insists he’s bowing out with nothing but good memories for playing for his country. 
He said: “I am extremely proud and grateful to have represented the people of Scotland at rugby for so long.
&quot;I will retire with many great memories of victories, tours, and friends, both in the playing squad and team management.
&quot;My wife Sarah is due our third child in August and I have to be with my family as much as possible before and after the birth.
 &quot;Clearly, with the World Cup looming, the national squad will be training and playing throughout that period and I have too much respect for the national jersey to put myself forward in those circumstances. 
&quot;I've made this decision now after much deliberation and lengthy discussions with team management so that they can plan ahead accordingly.&quot;
Murray’s club career includes spells at Northampton, Newcastle, Agen and made his Scotland debut in 2005 and toured with the British and Irish Lions in 2009 and Scots boss Vern Cotter paid tribute to the player who’s Christian beliefs ensured he would never play on a Sunday.
He said: “At his best Euan was a world-class tight-head prop. On behalf of the team and management I wish Euan and his family all the very best.&quot;

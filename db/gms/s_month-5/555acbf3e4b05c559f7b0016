A CAMPAIGN calling for reform of the private3 rented sector has won the backing of the city council.Shelter Scotland's Make Renting Right campaign aims to make Scotland's growing private rented sector fit for families and fairer for all. In Glasgow, almost 50,000 households rent privately.According to Shelter Scotland, private renting operates under an outdated tenancy regime that is not suited to providing a safe and secure environment for people to put down stable foundations in their communities.Adam Lang, Head of communications and policy at Shelter Scotland, said: &quot;We are pleased Glasgow City Council has joined our calls for a better private rented sector for tenants and landlords.&quot;Too often we hear of people being moved on, evicted or rents increased unreasonably, forcing people into the disruptive cycle of having to move house - every six months in some cases - preventing them from ever being able to put down strong roots and being part of a community.&quot;In the 21st century, we need a private rented sector that is modern, stable, flexible, predictable and fair for those individuals and families that call it home.&quot;Data from the Scottish Government shows that average rents in Greater Glasgow have increased by 11.1% in the last four years with an average rent for a two bedroom property currently standing at &pound;626 per month. [3]Councillor Helen Stephen, who proposed the motion said:&quot;I was pleased to bring Shelter Scotland's Make Renting Right campaign to the Council, and I am glad it has support of councillors across the city. With nearly 50,000 people living in the private rented sector, it is an important issue for Glasgow.&quot;For our young people, students, families and all of those who are choosing to make the private rented sector their homes, transformational and fair change is required.&quot;Glaswegians will be eagerly anticipating the upcoming Government legislation on this much-needed reform.&quot;Adam Lang added:&quot;The benefits of reform in the private rented sector would not just be felt by tenants. Landlords in Glasgow and across Scotland too would see a more constant and predictable income with less downtime between rents and a more stable relationships with their tenants.&quot;That's why we are asking people to support our campaign to positively reform the private rented sector and turn it into a place where the increasing numbers of people who rely on it can make a house a home and live with increased security and dignity.&quot;The Make Renting Right campaign from Shelter Scotland coincides with the Scottish Government's consultation on proposals to reform tenancies in the private rented sector and builds on the charity's previous campaigns in the sector.Shelter Scotland's key asks for reforming the sector include:€&cent; a modern tenancy agreement that gives both tenants and landlords security€&cent; more stability for people wanting to make rented housing their home€&cent; flexibility for people who want to stay in their rented home to do so for as long as they want€&cent; a fair system for sorting out renting problems when they occur€&cent; predictable rents for tenants and landlords

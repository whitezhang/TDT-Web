VANDALS superglued the locks on an SNP candidate's campaign office for the second time in weeks.Natalie McGarry, candidate for Glasgow East, was targeted overnight as the country prepared to go to the polls.Volunteers were unable to get into the office in West Muir Street at Parkhead Cross this morning after the locks on the shutters appeared to be superglued shut.The glue was drilled through and the hub was open by 7.30am.Ms McGarry previously said the vandalism was an &quot;attempt to silence us&quot;.After the first incident, she told the Evening Times: &quot;We see it as an attempt to silence us, and an attempt to silence democracy.&quot;Imagine the expense and the nuisance this has caused. But we won't be silenced.&quot;She said: &quot;Trying to lock us out our campaign office today will not stop the SNP locking the Tories out of Westminster.&quot;We are upbeat, enthused and speaking to voters all across Glasgow East.&quot;Volunteer Robert Bothewell rushed to the office this morning with his son after they were told of the incident.They had to drill through the locks to gain access the the venue in time for the First Minister's arrival shortly before 10am.Nicola Sturgeon is joining Ms McGarry in Baillieston for the afternoon to speak to SNP supporters before they take to the polling stations.Nic Dear, constituency chairman for the SNP Shettleston branch, was helping to coordinate the final campaign events from the office today, following the incident.He said it was disappointing that someone would &quot;try to disrupt the start of a campaign like this&quot; but added: &quot;At the end of the day it took half an hour to fix.&quot;Really it's just a nuisance.&quot;It costs money to get someone to come and fix it. It's happened before, it's the second time in the constituency.&quot;

LOVEBIRDS Catherine and Robert Baird were delighted to get a telegram from the Queen to mark 60 years of marriage.
And the icing on their anniversary cake was when the message was delivered by their postman grandson John Main, 32.
The couple were married at the registry office in Gilmour Street, Paisley, in April 1955.
They went on to have seven children – Brian, Diane, Peter, Andrea, Jacqueline, William and Alan – as well as 20 grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren.
Catherine, 77, said the secret to a long and happy marriage is “to have a wee argument here and there – with a bit of give and take”.
She added: “We have never been parted, apart from when he was in the Army.
 “We had been planning a church wedding, but he got his papers through  for National Service, so we brought it forward and had it in the registry office. 
“We had hoped to get married in Thomas Coats Memorial Church and we were always going to renew our vows, but we never got round to it.

“Now, we have a big family and we love them all.”
Robert, 78, worked as a roofer and handyman and ran his own business at one stage.
Catherine worked as a carer in various homes in the Paisley area, including Castlehead.
Grandaughter Charlene Mains, 31, from Glenburn, told the Paisley Daily Express: “The family are spread all over Scotland and there are a few of us in Paisley.
“We had a party for family and friends at the Gleniffer Hotel and they had a wee dance.”
Catherine added: “It was lovely to have the family together.
“Most of them were there and Robert and I had one dance to a song we like, Blanket On The Ground.”

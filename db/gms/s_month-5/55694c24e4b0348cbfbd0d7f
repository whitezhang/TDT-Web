BIG-HEARTED cyclists raising cash for a charity supporting murder victims' families have set off on their 300-mile trip.As told in the Evening Times, Stephen Stone and his wife Donna are cycling from Queens Park, on Glasgow's South Side, to the village of Weston, Staffordshire.The route begins in the park where businesswoman Moira Jones was murdered seven years ago.And the couple will finish in the home village of Moira's mum, Bea.They set off at 6am on Friday morning and hope to arrive at Weston's village green - where Bea will be waiting to welcome them back.Donna first met Bea delivering her post in the village and was determined to do something to help.Following Moira's murder, her mother set up The Moira Fund to support families grieving the death of a loved one who has been murdered.Bea contacted Olympian Sir Chris Hoy to alert him to Donna and Steve's efforts.And the gold medal cyclist wrote back, sending a good luck card to the couple.If all goes to plan, the pair will arrive late on Saturday evening where Bea will have a welcoming party ready.The route is 296 miles down the A8 and they set off on the anniversary of Moira's death.Former Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini, who prosecuted Moira's Slovakian killer Marek Harcar, is patron of The Moira Fund.Harcar was jailed for 25 years in 2009 after being found guilty of raping, robbing and killing Moira.To donate to The Moira Fund, and support the ride, visit mydonate.bt.com/events/anniversary cycleride/218006 catriona.stewart@eveningtimes.co.uk

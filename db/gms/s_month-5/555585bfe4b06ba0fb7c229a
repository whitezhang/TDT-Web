CITY councillors are to urge the Scottish Government to tackle the root cause of prostitution in Scotland.Councillor James Coleman called upon Justice Minister Michael Matheson to make a public commitment to target and challenge men's demand for paid-for sexual services.He said: &quot;We support the current Human Trafficking and Exploitation (Scotland) Bill but believe it is limited by the fact it does not adequately address the cause of commercial sexual exploitation.&quot;We are also fully supportive of the Scottish Government's 'Equally Safe' strategy, which recognises prostitution and trafficking as forms of commercial sexual exploitation that ultimately harm women.&quot;The city council agreed to call upon the Justice Minister to address the issue of demand, and to introduce comprehensive legislation in Scotland to criminalise the purchase of sex and to decriminalise and support those exploited through prostitution.The motion, which was seconded by SNP group leader Susan Aitken, was agreed at a meeting of the full council.

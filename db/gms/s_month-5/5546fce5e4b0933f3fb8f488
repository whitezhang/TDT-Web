A STUNNED comic book collector had to be chauffeur driven home after an Antiques Roadshow expert valued his collection at &pound;25,000.
Alec Whitelaw, from Livingston, appeared on the BBC1 show with a small collection of his prized Oor Wullie annuals.
Alec, 62, owns every Oor Wullie annual ever produced.
He took the train to the show at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow but TV bosses insisted he was driven home with his prized collection as a safety measure.
Alec said: “After they told me the value of the books they wouldn’t let me go home with them. They got me transport home in a nice car and I felt like Lady Muck.”

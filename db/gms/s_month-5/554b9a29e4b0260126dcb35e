THE Scottish people have turned out up and down the country to cast their votes in the 2015 General Election. 
They have been joined by the Scottish political party leaders and politicians. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell have cast their votes for the 2015 General Election at Broomhouse Community Hall polling station in Baillieston in Glasgow.

Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy turned out to cast his vote at Busby Primary School in the East Renfrewshire constituency he has represented since 1997.
A poll published last month showed Mr Murphy trailing the SNP in the area but he is confident of victory.
He said: &quot;I've always been the underdog in this constituency, it's usually the Tories who are favourites but the bookies say this time round it's the SNP but I always enjoy confounding the pollsters, the pundits and the bookies.
&quot;We've had a great response. The sun is shining and there's a huge amount of energy and confidence.&quot;

Meanwhile, Alex Salmond joined young SNP voter Nicki Falconer at a polling station in Ellon in the Gordon constituency where he is standing.
Nicki, who voted for the first time in last year's independence referendum, has since joined the party.
Mr Salmond posed for photographers as he chatted to voters outside Auchterellon School.
Asked how he was feeling as people across the country go to the polls, Mr Salmond said: &quot;Our tails are up not just here but across the country.&quot;
But he would not be drawn on seat predictions, stating: &quot;That is up to the people to decide, this is polling day, let's just let the people decide.&quot;
Monks from Sancta Maria Abbey in Nunraw also cast an unusual scene when they turned out to vote at a polling station in Garvald.

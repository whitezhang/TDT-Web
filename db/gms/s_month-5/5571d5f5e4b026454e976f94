A GRIEVING mum has slammed a sick website for publishing a picture of her baby son’s grave.
Disgusted Geni Turnbull, of Livingston, was online when she saw a photo of little Brian’s headstone at the town’s Adambrae cemetery.
He passed away in a cot death in 1990, at just three months old.
His picture was published on BillionGraves.com, who claim to help people find ancestors’ resting places.
A tearful Geni, 46, said: “I’m gutted and sick. I experience flashes of the stone replaying in my head and have been extremely depressed again.”
 The picture was taken down when our sister paper the West Lothian Courier contacted BillionGraves.com. 
But staff at Adambrae told Geni several other distraught relatives had reported seeing pictures of their loved ones’ tombstones on the site.

 SCOTT Harrison ’s Spanish villa has been wrecked by local youths running riot around it. 
The former world champion’s &pound;325,000 Alhaurin el Grande property has now been bricked up after being looted and vandalised.
Thieves have stolen the star’s front gate, the handrailing for a staircase and the swimming pool has also been trashed.
Now the factors of the villa have posted a warning in black spraypaint to would-be vandals, saying local police are investigating the attacks.
 Harrison, 37, was this week ordered to return to Spain to serve four years in jail . 
 

The boxer was convicted in 2012 for assaulting three men in a brothel near Malaga but fled the country and returned to Scotland before he could be jailed.
 But on Thursday the former champion was told to return to Spain within 17 days after Sheriff Thomas Welsh turned down his appeal against a European Arrest Warrant. 
Father-of-four Harrison shot to fame when he was crowned WBO featherweight champion in 2002.
It is thought he earned around &pound;4million. He was declared bankrupt in 2007 over an unpaid &pound;83,000 tax bill.
 

It is unclear who now owns the villa but locals believe the banks are in the process of repossessing the property.

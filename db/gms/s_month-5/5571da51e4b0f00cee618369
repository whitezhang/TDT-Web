 WHEN vets diagnosed Coco the rottweiler with terminal cancer , owner Symon Spencer wanted to make sure her final six weeks were memorable. 
So the 40-year-old and partner Theresa Clancy, 42, drew up a &shy;bucketlist of 30 fun things for his beloved pet to do before she died.
It included a day at the beach, a meal in a restaurant, trips in a police car and helicopter, having a drive-through Big Mac and visiting a fire station.
Coco &shy;completed the list with a sushi meal just a week before she was put down, aged eight.
Symon, of  Farnborough, Hampshire, said: “I’m really glad she was able to complete the bucket list. She was an amazing dog and I stayed with her the whole time. I was the last thing she saw. The support from everyone has been amazing.”
 Coco also met Channel 4 Supervet star Noel Fitzpatrick. Symon added: “She loved it. I think she forgot she was ill she had so much fun.” 
Coco was diagnosed with bone cancer in March and died on May 5 at home.
Symon said: “She was in agony and needed painkillers to cope. When she was giving her last breath, I was kissing her lots.
“I feel empty now.”

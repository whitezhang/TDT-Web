UNDER 18s could be banned from buying e-cigarettes under new government proposals.
Public Health Minister Maureen Watt said the plans will form part of the new Health Bill, which is due to be introduced later this year.
The bill would also make it an offence for an adult to buy the stop-smoking aid for minors.
The move comes after concerns were raised over the safety of electronic devices and fears that they could encourage young people to start smoking.
The health minister told The Scotsman: &quot;E-cigarettes might have a place when it comes to helping current smokers quit their habit.
&quot;This government is not opposed to e-cigarettes, but we think it is right to protect children from nicotine addiction, and to limit the prevalence of smoking behaviours.
&quot;Through this bill we will seek to strike that balance.&quot;
The bill also includes measures to make it a statutory offence to smoke cigarettes within hospital grounds, including fines of up to &pound;1,000.

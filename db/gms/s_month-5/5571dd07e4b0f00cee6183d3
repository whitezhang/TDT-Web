A TALENTED schoolgirl has been headhunted by some of the biggest names in computing after arguing more women should work in the industry.
Rachel Speirs, 15, received offers of top placements after she sent an essay outlining her point to Google vice president Alan Eustace in California.
The teen, from Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, received a reply from Eustace telling her she should regard her essay as an “application” for an internship.
Her essay was then run in a magazine and attracted the attention of Apple’s John Ive, who offered her work experience.
Rachel was also praised by Martha Lane Fox, founder of Lastminute.com.
The Douglas Academy pupil said: “Getting encouragement from people like them is wonderful.
“Martha Lane Fox is who I would like to emulate. She’s the most powerful woman in the field and a role model.
“I’m really interested in computer science and would love to work in technology or programming.”

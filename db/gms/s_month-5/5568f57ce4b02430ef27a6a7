 Motherwell are hopeful both Steven Hammell and Stephen Pearson will be fit for the second leg of their Scottish Premiership play-off against Rangers. 
 Hammell missed most of the season with a groin injury and Pearson went off in the second half of Well's 3-1 win at Ibrox. 
 Rangers will be without suspended defender Darren McGregor and a couple of unnamed injury concerns. 
 Defender Seb Faure and midfielder Gael Bigirimana are again sidelined. 
 The eventual winner of the tie will secure a place in next season's top flight with the loser consigned to the Championship. 
  Motherwell manager Ian Baraclough:  &quot;We have been strong at home and we have scored goals. 
 &quot;We know if we can score on Sunday, it will make Rangers' task more difficult. 
 &quot;But we know we will probably have to defend for long periods as well and make sure we are fully ready for what Stuart [McCall] and his men are going to bring to the party. 
 &quot;We go into the game with a two-goal lead and we will look to build on it.&quot; 
  Rangers manager Stuart McCall:  &quot;Football is all about goals. 
 &quot;We had a couple of chances and got our full-backs in wide areas, which is what we wanted. 
 &quot;But it was our worst home performance since I've been here. The boys got a little bit nervy and edgy if I'm honest. 
 &quot;However, I've got a belief that we will be better and hopefully Motherwell won't be as good. 
 &quot;Two goals is certainly not insurmountable but that's easy to say. We've got to do it and we've got to believe we can do it.&quot;

One person has been taken to hospital following a fire in Glasgow city centre.
A number of fire engines have been deployed to West Nile Street to deal with the incident in a basement next to Vroni's wine bar.
Part of the road has been cordoned off and some businesses in the area have been evacuated.
The injured person had suffered an electric shock, according to the emergency services.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said they were still dealing with a small fire, and that the large number of fire engines present was so that crews could be easily rotated in the small space where the blaze broke out.

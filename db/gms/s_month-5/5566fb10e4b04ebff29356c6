The UK's Defence Secretary Michael Fallon has said a whistleblower's concerns about Trident nuclear submarine safety have not been proved.
He said William McNeilly's allegations were either factually incorrect or the result of misunderstanding or partial understanding.
The Royal Navy submariner has claimed the missile system on the Clyde was a &quot;disaster waiting to happen&quot;.
He wrote a report, detailing &quot;serious security and safety breaches&quot;.
In a statement addressing the 25-year-old Able Seaman's concerns, Mr Fallon insisted that neither the &quot;operational effectiveness&quot; of the fleet &quot;nor the safety of our submariners or public have been compromised&quot;.
Able Seaman McNeilly, who is from Belfast, went on the run after making his claims earlier this month.
He was later &quot;apprehended&quot; by Royal Navy Police at Edinburgh Airport and was held at a military establishment in Scotland.
An official investigation was launched into the safety concerns he had raised. 
Mr McNeilly is an Engineering Technician Submariner who said he had been on patrol with HMS Victorious earlier this year.

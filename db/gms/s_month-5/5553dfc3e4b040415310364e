A GLASGOW man who was banned from driving was caught behind the wheel with both legs encased in plaster, a court has heard.Richard McAlpine had been disqualified from driving for five years in 2006 and was ordered to re-sit and pass the extended test before getting back behind the wheel.He failed to do so and on May 27, 2013 took the keys to his aunt's car and drove off in it, even though he was walking with the aid of crutches at the time and had two broken ankles.Paisley Sheriff Court heard that the 47-year-old had gone to meet members of his family in Neilston, East Renfrewshire, on the day in question but had an argument.In the row that followed, he grabbed the car keys and hobbled off before getting into the vehicle and driving off.Police were informed and intercepted him a short distance away.In court, McAlpine, of Harley Street, Cessnock, Glasgow, admitted driving while disqualified for the third time and also pleaded guilty to having no insurance and behaving in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause fear and alarm to others by shouting, swearing and uttering threats.It was stated that the accused had first been disqualified from driving for five years in 2003 then banned again for a similar period in 2005.Defence agent Garvie McCardle said that his client had a fall-out with relatives and in the heat of the moment without thinking, took the car keys and drove, albeit just a short distance.&quot;It was an act of petulance,&quot; said the lawyer.Although his period of disqualification had ended, he had failed to sit and pass the extended test as ordered and should not have been driving.The court was told that McAlpine had formerly owned his own successful taxi operation but lost that business after taking to alcohol following the break-up with his partner.On the day of his latest offence, he had gone to meet members of his family with both legs encased in plaster and walking with the aid of crutches, having sustained those injuries in &quot;a fall from a height.&quot;The court was told that he had now built bridges with family members and was hopeful he would move back in with his mother on his release from prison.Sheriff Colin Pettigrew told McAlpine that he only had himself to blame.He banned him for a further five-year period.

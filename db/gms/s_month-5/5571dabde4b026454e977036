A FRAIL pensioner with Alzheimer’s waited 12 hours for a hospital bed after falling ill at home.
First, it took three hours for 78-year-old Jim Walker’s ambulance to arrive.
He eventually got to hospital at nearly 10pm.
But he then had to wait, first on a trolley in a corridor and then in a curtained-off area of A&amp;E, until 4am to be seen by a doctor.
And even after the doctor finally arrived and said Jim should be admitted, there was yet another delay to come.
It was almost another three hours before he was given a bed.
Jim’s wife Nancy, who feared for a time that he had suffered a stroke, slammed the hold-ups at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in their home town of Paisley.
She told the Paisley Daily Express: “I don’t think it’s good enough to have patients waiting all that time without telling them what’s happening and how long it might take.
“To leave you there for hours without anybody coming near you, even to ask if you’d like a drink of water, just isn’t right.
“At first we were in a corridor, with Jim on a trolley. At 1am we were told he was first in the queue but, at 3am, they said he was third or fourth.
“He was getting to the stage where he was wanting to get off that trolley and go home.”
 

Nancy said Jim was eventually put in a partitioned area of A&amp;E and examined by a doctor at 3.50am. He was at last given a bed at 7am.
Jim, a former factory owner, had not suffered a stroke, but he spent six days in hospital while doctors monitored him.
A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said sorry to Jim and Nancy for the wait and said A&amp;E was very busy on the night they were there.
But they stressed that Jim was not left alone. He was seen by a senior nurse when he arrived and checked on and offered food and drinks regularly after that.

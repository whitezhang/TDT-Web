A SCOTTISH student studying in England is at the centre of a bizarre mystery after his family discovered he hasn't been attending lectures for six months.
Student Chay Dunn disappeared 11 days ago and police have voiced their concern for his safety.
 He last checked in with his mum in a phone call to their Aberdeenshire family home on May 18 - but neither his friends, fellow students or family has heard from him since. 
 Chay is usually an active user on social media , but there has been no updates since he last made contact with home. 
The 20-year-old has also not responded to phone or text messages left for him.
Chay has never gone missing before and his disappearance is &quot;completely out of character&quot;.
Detectives have since discovered that Chay has not attended university since November and no longer appears to be at his rented accommodation in the city.
 Police are trying to establish whether the student attended Brighton or Sussex University. 
Chay is described as white, 5'10&quot;, of thin build with shoulder-length brown hair.
He is clean shaven with blue eyes.
Police said they believe he was seen by people around where he lived the day before he went missing.
 If you know where Chay is, please email 101@sussex.pnn.police.uk or call 101 quoting serial 798 of 24/05. If he is in danger or in need of medical treatment, please call 999 immediately.

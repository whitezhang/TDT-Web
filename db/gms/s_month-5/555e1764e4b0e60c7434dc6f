STEWART PATERSON@patersonHTLABOUR has accused the SNP of cutting support for students and allowing debt to increase.Nicola Sturgeon was challenged by Labour deputy leader Kezia Dugdale at First Minister's questions who said bursaries and grants had been cut by &pound;40m.She said it was hampering young people form poorer backgrounds who get grades to go to university form getting the higher education the need to pursue professional careers.Ms Dugdale said: &quot;Since the SNP took office in 2007, bursaries and grants for students have been slashed by &pound;40 million. That is &pound;40 million less for students who have the talent to get on in life but who do not have the financial resources of their better-off peers.&quot;There are thousands of working-class kids who have the grades to be nurses, engineers and doctors but who cannot get the extra support that they need unless they borrow more.&quot;Ms Sturgeon told her the claim was not trueShe said: The reality is that the Government has exceeded the manifesto commitment that we made to support the poorest students by ensuring a minimum income of &pound;7,500 in maintenance support for students, because there was a 24 per cent increase in the value of the average support package between 2012-13 and 2013-14, up from &pound;4,320 in 2012-13.&quot;In addition, the average student loan debt for Scottish students is lower than the average debt of students in England, in Wales and in Northern Ireland.&quot;Ms Dugdale however said student from low income backgrounds faced debts of &pound;27,000 and that they had been let down.&quot;

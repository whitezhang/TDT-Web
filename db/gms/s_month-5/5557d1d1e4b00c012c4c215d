 Rangers skipper Lee McCulloch is rated 50/50 to make the Scottish Premiership quarter-final second leg but defensive colleague Bilel Mohsni is fit again. 
 Both missed last weekend's 2-1 win at Palmerston with training-ground knocks. 
 Queen of the South have no fitness or suspension worries but manager James Fowler may make changes. 
 Mark Millar and Iain Russell, who has scored 13 goals this season, came off the bench last weekend and are pushing for starts in midfield. 
  Rangers manager Stuart McCall:  &quot;As much as Queens will wind it up and make out that the first goal is all important, if we lose one it's not as if the tie is over. 
 &quot;With the quality we have and if we defend soundly I will be confident we'll create opportunities, regardless of whether we lose the first goal or not.&quot; 
  Queen of the South manager James Fowler:  &quot;We're confident we can go there and get a result. 
 &quot;We had them camped in their own half for most of the second half on Saturday and that shows how far we have come as a team this season. 
 &quot;Our aim is to play just as well and hopefully get the opening goal which will be crucial. The players won't be overawed and will want to test themselves in that atmosphere and show what they're capable of.&quot;

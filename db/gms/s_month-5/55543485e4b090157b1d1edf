A COMMUNITY has demanded action on a 'drugs epidemic' in the East End of Glasgow.People living in the Calton say they are finding hundreds of used syringes in green spaces and fear it will cause injuries to children.The Evening Times visited a green space across from Morrisons supermarket, behind the Gallowgate, yesterday afternoon and saw two men who appeared to be using drugs.One man was slumped over on the ground holding a needle.We reported the incident, however residents and workers say they are dealing with this every day.It came after we told how 43 syringes were found in a public toilet block in just 11 days.Cleaners - and sometimes members of the public - using the Stevenson West loos, in the Barras, are discovering used needles in the facilities regularly.But Calton residents say this is just the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot;.A 30-year-old local, who asked not to be named, thanked us for raising the issue.He said: &quot;I've never seen it this bad.&quot;Drugs are an epidemic in the East End and it's getting worse. No-one is doing enough, the police don't seem to be doing enough.&quot;I take my dogs out and I'm worried about them sniffing about when there's needles lying on the ground.&quot;It's just a matter of time before a kid is injured.&quot;A local businessman, who did not want to be identified, said he had also noticed a problem with people buying cans of lighter fuel from the supermarket and sniffing it in wasteland.He said: &quot;There's often fires, it's really dangerous.&quot;Another businessman said: &quot;You do see drug users all the time in this area.&quot;Calton councillor George Redmond said he was &quot;horrified&quot; by the situation.He added: &quot;There is an action plan in place to deal with the people who are leaving these needles..&quot;We've spoken to the police, community safety services and land and environmental services and we really hope there will be some positive action on this.&quot;Mr Redmond said the Calton area had &quot;some challenges&quot; but it had improved over the years.He said: &quot;There have been issues of drug using and prostitution but police have stepped up their patrols and we've been trying to crack down on it.&quot;Inspector Matthew Webb, of London Road Police Office, said: &quot;It is something we've been aware of for a while. There has been work done with elected members and land and environmental services.&quot;We'd be keen to encourage safe disposal at chemists from the users.&quot;We want to hear from members of the public when they find hot spots so we can address it.&quot;We also want to hear from people who have information on the supply of these drugs.&quot;Anyone with information is asked to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

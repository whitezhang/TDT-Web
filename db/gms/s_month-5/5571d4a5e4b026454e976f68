COMMUTERS got the shock of their lives when an elderly driver drove the wrong way up a busy dual carriageway.
Edinburgh motorists encountered the elderly man driving a black Volkswagen Golf the wrong way along the A8 Glasgow Road.
One driver’s dashcam caught the dramatic moment on film, showing the driver of a black Ford KA steering clear of an accident at the last minute.
The video, posted by website Scotland’s Worst Drivers, shows the Volkswagen driver carrying on regardless.
Michael Gray, the driver who caught last Monday’s incident on video, said: “It was a public holiday and traffic was calmer than usual.
 

“It was an elderly gentleman and I believe he drove from the South Gyle direction.
“He didn’t make any attempt to stop after passing me and just continued towards the Maybury junction.”
A spokesman from Learn Driving Skills, a driving tuition company, said: “The driver could have caused a serious collision as the last thing you expect coming towards you on a dual carriageway is another vehicle.
“Although road marking may be hard to see, directional signs usually are clear and visible in good time.”
The video was posted online by Scotland’s Worst Drivers, a website aimed at “shaming bad driving north of the border.”

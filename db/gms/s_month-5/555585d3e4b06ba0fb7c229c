EVERY child in Glasgow is to be taught a procedure which could save the life of heart attack victims.The move was raised at a meeting of the city council by Green councillor Martin Bartos.It was seconded by Labour education convener Stephen Curran and received unanimous cross-party support.Mr Bartos said recent tragedies and the drive by local people to help victims had highlighted the need for widescale emergency response training.He called for age appropriate instructions to be introduced in schools across the city on how to help someone suffering a heart attack.The aim is that by next summer, every teenager leaving school will have received training in cardiopulminary resuscitation (CPR).And he called on every library, museum and sports facility in the city run by Glasgow Life to provide information about local groups which offer training in CPR, first aid and emergency response.Mr Barton said he wanted Glasgow citizens to be able to help each other not just in the city but anywhere they travelled in the world.He added: &quot;There is a short space of time between the point of someone's heart stopping and meaningful life ebbing away.&quot;This is about ensuring every child learns how to respond to emergencies.&quot;Councillor John Kane recalled how one evening in 1998 his &quot;best friend and soulmate&quot; suffered a cardiac arrest while they were together.He said: &quot;My role was to keep blood and oxygen circulating in his body until the emergency services arrived. Now 16.5 years later, he is listening to this debate.Mr Kane said: &quot;I don't claim credit for saving David's life but I know I played a part because of the training I received so we must encourage as many Glaswegians as possible to be lifesavers.&quot;Councillor Archie Graham, who is chairman of Glasgow Life, said a range of programmes are in place to train staff in libraries, museums and sports facilities in CPR.And he said it was &quot;absolutely right&quot; that visitors to the centres should be provided with information about where to get similar training as well as other lifesaving measures.

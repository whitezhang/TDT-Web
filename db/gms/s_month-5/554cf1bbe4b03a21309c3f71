 Manager Stuart McCall is urging his Rangers players to rise to the occasion when their play-off campaign opens away to Queen of the South on Saturday. 
 &quot;I'm confident this group of players can put in a good performance and progress,&quot; said McCall. 
 &quot;If you fear failure, you will freeze. The message is go and relish the opportunity to get out of this league. 
 &quot;This is what we've been looking forward to, what we've been building to, what the season boils down to.&quot; 
 Rangers take on Queens over two legs, with the winners going on to face Hibernian for a place in the final against the team finishing second bottom of the Premiership. 
 The Ibrox side have lost just one of their last 15 games but that was a 3-0 defeat at Palmerston Park. 
 &quot;They were better on the day than us,&quot; said McCall. &quot;If you analyse the game, I think they scored with their first shot on target after 30 minutes. 
 &quot;The killer was losing a second 10 seconds into the second half, then we're chasing it and they can pick us off. 
 &quot;Tomorrow will be different since we will have another 90 minutes at Ibrox to play. We won't need to go gung-ho to get a goal back if we go behind. 
 &quot;The aim is to go through over two legs but we're looking to win down there. 
 &quot;We have been creating chances, which is great for a manager, but we need to cut out silly individual errors that have been costing us goals. 
 &quot;I've been really pleased with a lot of our performances of late. 
 &quot;But for a 90th-minute equaliser at Tynecastle, we'd have beaten Hearts twice, we had a good result at Hibs [a 2-0 win], so there's a lot to be positive about.&quot; 
 Rangers trained on astroturf on Friday morning in preparation for the artificial surface at Palmerston and McCall insists the pitch is not a worry. 
 &quot;I'd rather play on an artificial surface than on a bobbly end of season surface somewhere,&quot; added McCall. 
 &quot;We've got good technical players who will suit that surface.&quot;

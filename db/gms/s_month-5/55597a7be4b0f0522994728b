CABBIE bosses have axed boundary charges for passengers in Glasgow, the Evening Times can today reveal.Customers booking by phone and travelling beyond the city limits will now be offered fixed prices by Glasgow Taxis Ltd.The motion to make the change was passed at the firm's recent AGMGlasgow Taxis Ltd bosses said the move was designed to ensure the company can be as &quot;competitive as possible in an ever-evolving market&quot;.Stephen Flynn, vice chairman, said: &quot;The removal of the boundary charge for any bookings made by telephone will remove any confusion in this area while adding value and passing on savings to our customers.&quot;Fixed prices are easy to understand and provide certainty and reassurance for passengers.&quot;We want to reward those longstanding, valued individuals and businesses who regularly travel distances with us while also making our overall offering much clearer and simpler for people to understand.&quot;It's all part of Glasgow Taxis Ltd's overall commitment to further improve the service we can offer and we will continue to invest in this area for the benefit of customers.&quot;Axing the boundary charges is the latest in a range of new services rolled out by Glasgow Taxis Ltd in recent years.The company recently introduced credit card payment machines to all of its 850 vehicles - and has since added contactless payment capability to them.Booking apps are also available for iPhones and Android devices, and are regularly updated in a bid to keep up with online competitors.Mr Flynn added: &quot;The unique selling point of our apps is thatcustomers are guaranteed a fully licensed taxi and fully disclosed driver.&quot;Glasgow Taxis Ltd operates two thirds of the licenced cabs on the city's streets.Police have repeatedly urged revellers on nights out in Glasgow to use hackney cabs and the NiteZone scheme.Last month, the Evening Times told how pub goers and clubbers were warned over rogue taxi drivers after a young woman was sexually assaulted by a motorist who picked her up.The 23-year-old was driven from Glasgow city centre to the West End and then attacked.She was helped into a car, which police believe could possibly be a taxi, by a man and woman in Renfield Street.But the young woman was driven to Great Western Road, near to the Lincoln Inn, where she was sexually assaulted.Inspector Gavin Smith warned revellers about the dangers of bogus cabbies.He said: &quot;I would like to remind everyone to use caution when travelling home and to take some simple precautions that will help keep you safe.&quot;Do not use unofficial ranks or unlicensed taxis, it's simply not worth the risk.&quot;I would urge people to use NiteZone ranks or to only get into a private hire that they have booked themselves.&quot;Remember, all genuine taxi drivers carry ID, which you can always ask to see.&quot;Anyone with suspicions as to the legitimacy of any taxi driver should not get into the vehicle and should contact police.&quot;

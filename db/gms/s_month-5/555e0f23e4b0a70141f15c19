PAOLO Nutini’s dad admits the Paisley born singer was ‘a wee bit upset’ after finding out he met up with Al Pacino at his Scots gig.
Alfredo Nutini was with Clan Italia boss and Italian tartan creator pal Michael Lemetti when the two were invited backstage to meet up with the Godfather actor in Glasgow.
As Michael handed Al a couple of waistcoasts, a scarf and hat in the Italian plaid, Alfredo relaxed on the sofa with Al and chatted about having the same name.
Alfredo laughed: “It was one don to another. I’m a Godfather fan and Michael Corleone is one of my heroes.
My name is Alredo and his real name is Alfredo although not alot of people know he’s called that. I was named after my grandfather and so was he so we chatted about the fact we had that in common.”
 

He added: “When I told Paolo I’d met Al after the show I think he might have been a wee bit upset. He is looking forward to his Bellahouston Park gig in August and is busy preparing at the moment but admitted he should have been there.
&quot;His favourite film is Scent Of A Woman with Al Pacino, where he learns the tango.”
Whilst Al Pacino was charging &pound;7,000 for a private lunch and &pound;25,000 to share a trip on his private jet there didn’t seem to be any sign of takers in Scotland, although some people paid &pound;550 for a meet and greet with a glass of bubbly.
Simple Minds singer Jim Kerr and his band who just played Vegas are hoping to meet up with Al tonight - and have front row tickets for his appearance in London.

OVER the past decade thousands of international media organisations have travelled to Glasgow to see for themselves what the city has to offer.For Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this month, it is an important way of promoting Scotland's largest city.In the past 10 years, more than 2000 journalists and TV crews from every corner of the globe have visited the city with each one liking what they see.The New York Times, Le Monde, Spain's El Pais, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Toronto Globe and Mail, Germany's Die Zeit, Time Out Beijing, Rough Guides and Lonely Planet are just a few of the world leading publications to be welcomed by the Bureau.International broadcasters from Australia's Channel 10, Sky New Zealand and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to NBC in the US and China's Xinhau News Agency have also agreed Glasgow is a must see destination.Their reports and broadcasts have helped to reinforce the city's position as Scotland's creative, cultural and sporting capital and one of the world's most vibrant, dynamic and stylish cities.Behind the scenes, GCMB staff are forging links with key international visitor markets.That involves everything from planning and implementing UK and international advertising campaigns to working with airlines, rail and ferry operators to highlight direct routes to the city to boost the number of visitors.The focus is on highlighting the city's shops, cultural attractions, restaurants, bars and hotels as well as the year round major events programme and conference facilities as well as venues like the Hydro.City council leader Gordon Matheson, who is chairman of the Bureau, said: &quot;Our approach to marketing Glasgow is one of integration and innovation.&quot;We work hand-in-hand with Glasgow Airport, Glasgow Restaurant Association, the Greater Glasgow Hotels Association, Glasgow's leading attractions the City Centre Retail Association and key retailers, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, the SECC, the city's academic community and national partners such as VisitScotland across a broad spectrum of creative campaigns and initiatives aimed at growing the city's visitor and tourism economy.&quot;The overwhelming success of the Commonwealth Games last year has ensured Glasgow's global profile has never been greater and we are now firmly recognised as a first choice, must-visit destination.&quot;However, that doesn't mean we can rest on our laurels. Our focus now is to ensure Glasgow's message remains front of mind in the coming months and beyond and that the unforgettable experience of 2014 will encourage visitors to want to return time and again.&quot;Over the course of this year, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau will be implementing targeted marketing campaigns across key UK and international territories geared at engaging and attracting even more visitors from across the world and capitalising on the interest in Glasgow that we know exists globally at present.&quot;Recently the city was voted the 'friendliest city in the world' in a Rough Guides poll and named a must visit destination by leading publications like the New York Times, The Guardian and Wanderlust.The Lonely Planet pointed out that with over 1500 shops to choose from, Glasgow is 'a shopaholic's paradise' and consistently voted one of the top place to shop in the UK, second only to London's West End.With almost 1800 cafes and restaurants listed for the city on TripAdvisor, the travel guide described Glasgow as 'the best and most eclectic dining city in Europe.'

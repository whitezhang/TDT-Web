A LATE Scots film-maker whose clips of Ryan Gosling ‘refusing’ to eat his cereal garnered a huge online following has been paid tribute to by the Canadian actor, who filmed himself eating a bowl of cereal in his honour. 
Gosling, best known for starring in The Notebook and Drive, was the unwitting star of a series of Vines, Ryan Gosling Won’t Eat His Cereal, created by Ryan McHendry. A typical six-second clip would show a spoon of cereal being presented to Gosling onscreen, who would then appear to refuse to eat it. 
After posting his own Vine, Gosling tweeted: “My heart goes out to all of Ryan McHenry’s family and friends. Feel very lucky to have been a part of his life in some small way.”
The Dumfries-born film-maker, who lived in Glasgow, died aged 27 of osteosarcoma after being diagnosed two years ago. 
Naysun Alae-Carew, 29, a friend of Mr McHenry, said: “It’s the most fitting send-off any of his friends or family could have hoped for. It was something he had always talked about.
“A few weeks ago Ryan Gosling acknowledged the vines for the first time and Ryan McHenry was really happy about it.
“To have this is just amazing and for us and particularly his family it just really validates how much Ryan gave. They are just vines to make people laugh but to have Ryan Gosling respond just shows the effect that Ryan McHenry had on the world.”
A group of the film-maker’s friends have set up a page for donations to the cancer charity Sarcoma UK in his memory, saying there was “nothing more appropriate to honour Ryan’s life than by making a positive impact on the lives of others suffering from this disease”.
The page has already raised more than &pound;3,300 towards its &pound;7,500 target.
Mr Alae-Carew said: “He had always talked to us about wanting to raise money when he was feeling better but that never happened, and we wanted to do something positive in his memory.”

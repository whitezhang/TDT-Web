CLINICAL staff at the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice are looking forward to the move to a new, purpose-built home.They know that improved facilities, more space and increased privacy for families going through difficult times, mean better care for patients.Lead consultant Dr Laura Kelly sums it up.&quot;We are looking forward to giving our patients the care they deserve,&quot; she says, simply.&quot;We have outgrown our building here on Carlton Place. It has been a fantastic place, on the banks of the river, right in the heart of Glasgow.&quot;But it is time to move on.&quot;The state-of-the-art building in Bellahouston Park will also help the clinical teams develop its services for young adults.&quot;This is an extremely important, emerging area in palliative care in Scotland,&quot; explains Dr Kelly.&quot;So far, we have been unable to provide facilities or specially designed services for young people - the hospice is a welcoming place, but it's not ideal for young adults.&quot;The new building will allow us to extend our services to those aged 15 and above. There's a dedicated lounge, which gives them their own space - somewhere their friends can come, where they can all feel comfortable.&quot;Inpatients Sister Ann Bradley agrees.&quot;It's important young people get the chance to socialise, relax with their friends - just get on with living their lives,&quot; she says.&quot;Although that person's life is coming to an end, the whole point of hospice care is to help make that life as good as it can be, for as long as possible.&quot;Increased privacy for patients and their families is one of the biggest benefits of the new building, as Ann explains.&quot;There has been a real shift in attitudes in recent years - even in the 12 years since I joined the hospice,&quot; she says.&quot;Patients want time to themselves, away from a traditional ward set-up, where they can be with their families and talk to the medical staff in private.&quot;Currently 10 of our 14 beds are in shared wards, and that has a huge impact on privacy and comfort.&quot;Dr Kelly adds: &quot;It also puts pressure on people - I'm always amazed by how considerate families are regarding other patients, even when they are going through incredibly difficult times themselves. They're worried they might disturb people, for example, by talking later at night, or bringing in young children.&quot;The new layout will improve that situation for everyone.&quot;In the new building, all 16 bedrooms will be private and en-suite, with space for families to stay overnight and eat together. The bedroom can also be opened fully to a social area, helping patients feel connected and secure.&quot;Families can stay at the moment, but they tend to be scattered all over the place, depending on where there is room,&quot; says Ann.&quot;Some have to sleep on a fold out bed next to the patient or on a couch and there is only private space for one family to be together from the bedside - we want families to feel at home, so the new family suites will be fantastic.&quot;There is also a dedicated children's play lounge which opens onto a safe courtyard.&quot;Improvements to outpatients services will also be far-reaching, as Dr Kelly explains.&quot;It will be great to have more space, more rooms for clinics, such as fatigue management and physiotherapy, plus art therapy, counselling, occupational therapy and day services,&quot; she says. &quot;All of these improve life for patients, helping them to stay at home longer, for example.&quot;Extra space means we can develop our education programmes too.&quot;The current hospice has wonderful views across the Clyde, but little outdoor space. That will change significantly with the move to Bellahouston Park.&quot;Getting outside, in the fresh air and sunshine, has important physical and psychological benefits,&quot; says Dr Kelly.&quot;All of the rooms will have access to the beautiful gardens and patients will be able to get outside, even if they are in bed. At the moment, our little garden is completely inaccessible to anyone restricted to bed so this will make a huge difference.&quot;Work on site started this week and it's expected the new hospice will open its doors in 2018.For Dr Kelly, Ann Bradley and the rest of the clinical teams, leaving behind Carlton Place will be hard - but they are excited about the future.&quot;This has been a lovely place to be and it has served us well,&quot; adds Dr Kelly. &quot;But to be moving into a brand new, purpose-built hospice that can offer the kind of 21st century care everyone with a life-limiting illness should have, is just fantastic.&quot;Donate online at www.ppwh.org.uk/donate

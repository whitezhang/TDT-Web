SCOTLAND’S ski season brought more than &pound;23million to the country’s economy before it closed for the summer.
An estimated &pound;4.6million was spent at snowsports areas, while a further &pound;18.6million went to Hotels and B&amp;Bs, restaurants, bars, shops and filling stations.
The figure is down on last season when 5000 more skiers and snowboarders took to the slopes. In total, across the five outdoor snowsports centres nationwide, there were 463 operational days in which enthusiasts could use the hills.
A total of 230,634 passes were sold for the slopes compared to 235,303 last year.
The figures are eclipsed by the 2012-13 season when a better winter saw 290,996 passes recorded and an estimated &pound;29.2million generated.
Chair of Ski-Scotland Heather Negus said: “We had excellent snow at most resorts and the five snowsports areas were able to operate for a total of 463 days, better than last season’s 441.”
Late flurries of snow in April saw families travelling north during their Easter breaks, providing an added boost to tourism in Scotland.
North East MSP Christian Allard said: “I am delighted the season just finished has been particularly successful – the Glenshee and Lecht Ski Centres are great facilities which provide an excellent opportunity for people in the North East and beyond to try their hand at winter sports.”

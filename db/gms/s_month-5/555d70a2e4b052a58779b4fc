GLASGOW City Council has apologised after parents were told they would have to pay to help clean up a primary school.Members of Hyndland primary school parent council were horrified to be slapped with a &pound;113 bill for a proposed school tidy-up at the weekend.The school council was told that council policy had changed and it &quot;events such as this weekend's planned spring clean&quot; were classed as &quot;a community activity&quot; and a &quot;family/fun day&quot;, an email from the parent council said.In the note, a spokesman said it was &quot;somewhat offensive&quot;, given that the volunteers were doing work the local authority had failed to do.He wrote: &quot;Glasgow City Council (GCC) have been informed us this week that we will have to pay both for a school let - &pound;40.40 - and the janitorial cost - &pound;72.96 - for a total of &pound;113.36. We have been told via community letting at GCC and at this week's Glasgow Parent Teacher Forum meeting that it is now the council's policy to charge for events such as the spring clean because it is a community activity/family fun day.&quot;We believe that such activity only occurs because the local authority generally does not fund/carry out this work. &quot;Requiring parent councils to fund such activity is somewhat offensive, given the level of commitment shown by parent volunteers.&quot;He said the council was &quot;firmly of the view&quot; that funds raised by parents to undertake such events should not be &quot;side-tracked inappropriately by GCC in the form of let payments.&quot;The clean up, due to take place on Sunday, was cancelled.Council chairman John Lewis said they were later told by the council's education service they would not have to pay. He said a recent meeting of Glasgow Parent Teacher Forum had raised the issue and there were concerns it could have affected other schools.He added: &quot;We are pleased we can now have the clean up and won't have to pay which is great, but there are questions whether other parent councils will run into the same problem.&quot;He said the clean up had now been scheduled for two weeks time.A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said they apologised for the confusion caused by the mistake and they rectified it as soon as they were made aware.She added: &quot;There has been no change to school let policies recently.&quot;The parent group should not have been charged for their 'Spring Clean' and we have been in touch to let them know this.&quot;We consider all requests on their merits and this was just a mistake.&quot;Sandra White, SNP MSP for Glasgow Kelvin, was sceptical.She said: &quot;They say it's a one-off but is this person practising what the council guidelines say? If so, it could happen again and the guidelines need to be changed.&quot;The headteacher of Hyndland primary school declined to comment.

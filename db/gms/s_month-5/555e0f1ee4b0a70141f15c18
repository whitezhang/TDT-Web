THE FUTURE of around 3000 shipbuilding jobs on the Clyde has been secured today with a &pound;100 million investment from BAE Systems.
It means the defence firm’s Glasgow yards at both Govan and Scotstoun will remain open following speculation last year that at least one of them could close.
The company said they would use the money to expand both sites which is a move from a previously preferred plan to invest &pound;200 million in Scotstoun and shut Govan.
But BAE chief executive Ian King last year also cast doubt over the future of both yards when he suggested the company would consider its future in Scotland if the country had voted yes in the independence referendum.
A BAE spokesman said today: “Following an assessment of potential facilities options, we have decided to retain and invest in both of our sites in Glasgow.
“We will work closely with our trade unions as we prepare the detailed designs to improve and expand our manufacturing facilities, which will mark the most significant investment in the Glasgow shipyards in decades.”
The firm says the money will be used for new technology to build more complex warships.
“This will enable us to create a modern, safe and inspiring workplace for our employees, whilst ensuring we deliver equipment to the highest quality at the lowest possible cost so we can compete effectively for future UK and international orders,” the spokesman added.
After last September’s no vote, BAE said they had chosen its Scottish workforce for a &pound;4 billion contract to build new warships for the MOD.

An accountant who sued bra tycoon Michelle Mone’s firm for &pound;20,000 has settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.
Hugh McGinley, 53, quit his job at Mone’s old company MJM Inter-national claiming he was caught in the middle of her split from husband and business partner Michael.
Hugh, of Glasgow, claimed constructive dismissal and told a tribunal staff who got on her wrong side had “their lives made hell.”
Last night, he said he had signed a confidentiality agreement and could not comment on the case.
He told a Glasgow hearing last year that the bra tycoon was “demanding”.
He said: “If staff got on the wrong side of Michelle, their lives would be made hell.”
Bra queen Michelle sold off most of her stake in Ultimo last year after previously selling a majority share to Sri Lanka-based MAS. She now works for Ultimo for five days a month and sits on the board.
Michelle’s spokesman said: “Although she is on the board, she isn’t involved in the day-to-day running.”

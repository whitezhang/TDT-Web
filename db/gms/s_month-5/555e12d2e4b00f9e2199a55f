BAE has unveiled plans to pump &pound;100 million of investment into two Clyde shipyards.
The defence firm told employees on Thursday that it would be investing in the Govan and Scotstoun shipyards, following a decision to retain both sites.
The future of Govan Fairfield, which BAE leases from Clydeport, had been up in the air while the company considered its options, including transferring all work to the Scotstoun yard.
A BAE spokesperson confirmed that the 3000 workers employed at both sites would not have been threatened by any of the firm’s decisions.
He said: “Following an assessment of potential facilities options, we have decided to retain and invest in both of our sites in Glasgow.
“We will work closely with our trade unions as we prepare the detailed designs to improve and expand our manufacturing facilities, which will mark the most significant investment in the Glasgow shipyards in decades.”
He said that ‘improved infrastructure’ and ‘investment in new technologies’ would help the firm rejig the way warships were designed and built, adding: “This will enable us to create a modern, safe and inspiring workplace for our employees, whilst ensuring we deliver equipment to the highest quality at the lowest possible cost so we can compete effectively for future UK and international orders.”

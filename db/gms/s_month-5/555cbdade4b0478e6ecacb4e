THE GIRLFRIEND of the man accused of murdering Kevin 'Gerbil' Carroll was suspected of committing conspiracy to murder him, a court heard today.
Detective constable David Barr told the High Court in Glasgow he detained Sarah Maguire in October 2014.
He said she was suspected of conspiring to murder Mr Carroll but that she was released without any charge.
The officer was giving evidence at the trial of William Paterson, 35, who allegedly murdered Mr Carroll on January 13, 2010 at Asda Robroyston.
It is claimed - while masked and acting with others - Paterson repeatedly discharged loaded handguns at 29 year-old Carroll shooting him on the head and body.
Paterson is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
Advocate depute Iain McSporran put to the witness that on October 14, 2010 he detained Miss Maguire &quot;as a suspect&quot; in relation to a conspiracy to murder Mr Carroll.
DC Barr replied: &quot;Yes.&quot;
Mr McSporran asked if she was interviewed and at the conclusion released without any further proceedings taken.
The witness said: &quot;That's correct.&quot;
Paterson denies the charges and has incriminated six people.
He has lodged a special defence of alibi claiming he was at an address in Cumbernauld at the time of the shooting.
The trial before judge Lord Armstrong continues.

POLICE have stepped up patrols on city streets amid fears of a gangland war.
Mark Bristow, 29, was blasted in the legs as he lay on the ground after being hit by a Mitsubishi 4x4 in what is believed to be a feud between two families.
Police have linked the attack on Thursday at 6.30pm to incidents going back five years involving the Boyce family, of Royston, Glasgow, and the Morrisons of nearby Blackhill.
Bristow, who was in a serious condition in hospital after the attack on Glasgow’s Royston Road, is thought to be close to the Boyce family.
A source said: “This is not over at all. There is a lot of bad blood between these two groups and this is just the latest chapter. It may take a while but there will be folk planning ways to dish out some karma.”
Police are treating the attack as attempted murder and were checking CCTV for evidence and carrying out door to door inquiries.
The victim was stepping out of his Audi when he was deliberately run over by the 4x4, police said.
The attackers then turned the car around before shooting him. The vehicle was later found dumped in the Robroyston area.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Our inquiries are ongoing.”

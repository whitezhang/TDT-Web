 Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen has won the Scottish PFA player of the year award. 
 The Norwegian international, 24, has scored 12 goals for a Celtic team that has won the Scottish Premiership and League Cup. 
 Celtic defender Jason Denayer, on loan from Manchester City, won the young player award. 
 St Mirren's Stevie Mallan won goal of the season for his strike in the 3-1 win over Dundee in December. 
 A PFA Scotland merit award was given to Jordan Moore, the 21-year-old Dundee United striker on loan at Queen's Park, after he twice fought skin cancer. 
 Belgian Denayer, 19, does not yet know if he will spend another season at Celtic as he is keen to force his way into City's plans. 
 On moving back to the English Premier League, he told BBC Scotland: &quot;I hope so, but I don't know. I need to wait until summer and see what is going to happen. 
 He added: &quot;It is a very good feeling because to be recognised by the other players is a amazing feeling. 
 &quot;When I came here I just wanted to play some games and take some experience, but now I win trophies and personal trophies so it has gone better than I expected.&quot; 
 John Hughes has been named PFA Scotland manager of the year after guiding Inverness to the Scottish Cup final. 
 Hibs midfielder Scott Allan, Morton striker Declan McManus and Arbroath forward Bobby Linn took the player prizes in the Championship, League One and League Two respectively.

A FOOTBALL-crazy boy bravely battling a brain tumour said he was “really happy” yesterday as he collected the St Mirren player of the year award from his heroes at the SPFL club.
Six-year-old Aaron Woodall, of Paisley, saw off competition from the likes of star midfielder John McGinn to take the honour in an online vote staged through the Black and White Army fans’ website.
Saints supporters were hugely impressed by Aaron’s courage as he continues his fight against a tumour that was diagnosed late last year.
And yesterday the Todholm Primary pupil picked up his award from his favourite player Steven Thompson and Buddies boss Gary Teale.
Aaron, who is a member of St Mirren’s Junior Academy, told our sister paper the Paisley Daily Express: “It was nice to meet the players. I feel really happy.”
Surgery to remove Aaron’s brain tumour was successful but he also had to have months of radiotherapy and is undergoing chemotherapy.
 

But yesterday’s visit to St Mirren’s training base in Ralston provided the perfect pick-me-up.
As well as meeting the manager and players, Aaron was presented with a framed St Mirren shirt, signed by the League Cup-winning team of 2013.
His dad David, 41, said the family have been deeply moved by the kindness and encouragement shown by St Mirren and the club’s fans.
He added: “We are so proud of Aaron and have been overwhelmed by the incredible support from both the club and its fans in recognising him with this award. I’d like to thank them all for their encouragement.”
David MacDonald, Black and White Army webmaster, said: “One of our fans suggested adding Aaron to the list of candidates for the Player of the Year award and we’re absolutely delighted he has won.”

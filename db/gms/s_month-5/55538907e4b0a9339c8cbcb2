An 8m-high pyramid-shaped viewpoint has been unveiled on the banks of Loch Lomond in Argyll.
The structure - named An Ceann Mor - occupies a secluded spot at Inveruglas on the west of the loch, with views of the Arrochar Alps and Ben Lomond.
It is the fourth and final installation of a pilot project for Scottish Scenic Routes.
The previous three are at the Falls of Falloch, Balquihidder and Loch Lubnaig near Strathyre.
Scottish Scenic Routes is a Scottish government initiative designed to encourage visitors travelling along scenic tourist routes to stop and see much-loved views in a new way.
An Ceann Mor - which means large headland in Gaelic - was designed by Daniel Bar, Stephane Toussaint and Sean Edwards.
The structure is clad in sustainable timber which, over time, will fade to a silver-grey to blend in with the landscape.
The next phase of Scottish Scenic Routes is already under way in Cairngorms National Park and at sites across Scotland identified by Scottish Canals.

Crosslane Student Developments has secured planning for a new 237-bed student accommodation development in Edinburgh city centre.
Crosslane Student Developments, part of the Crosslane Group, said the development on a vacant site on Lutton Place, off South Clerk Street, is valued at &pound;30.7 million.
The development will offer en-suite accommodation in cluster flats for between three and six people, as well as luxury studio accommodation for individuals and couples.
Work is expected to begin immediately and is expected to complete in time for the 2017 academic year.
Crosslane says it currently has 20,000 student beds under management including accommodation in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee.
Jon Stewart, Director at Crosslane Student Developments, said: “We pride ourselves on developing student accommodation in desirable locations to an excellent standard.
“One of the fastest growing city regions in Europe, Edinburgh is home to 47,000 students and continues to be a first choice city for prospective students looking for new, purpose-built facilities.
“The project has the additional benefit of expanding our Scottish footprint and building our portfolio of projects in the region.”

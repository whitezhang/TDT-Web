AN inquiry into historical child abuse will be expanded to health and education institutions, it has been announced.The public inquiry into abuse of children in care homes will now also investigate allegations of abuse in foster care, long term hospital care and boarding schools.Education Secretary, Angela Constance, announced the changes when she revealed the chair of the inquiry.Susan O'Brien QC, who set up a Scottish Child Law Centre in Glasgow and who was the Chair of a panel of three which investigated the death of baby, Caleb Ness, and who produced the report on the case in 2003, will head the team.Ms Constance also announced &pound;14.5m funding for support services to allow survivors to access appropriate services.She said: &quot;Reaching a decision on the exact scope of the Inquiry has been challenging, given the wide range of views, even among survivors. The remit cannot be so wide that survivors lose hope of the Inquiry ever reaching clear, specific conclusions.&quot;I am mindful of the urgency of this last issue, given the age and health of some of the leading campaigners.&quot;The Inquiry will examine any instance where a child was abused 'in care', at institutions including residential care provided by faith based organisations; children's homes and secure care. The scope will also include those placed in foster care.&quot;The inquiry will be set up by October this year with Ms O'Brien being assisted by expert assessors and an inquiry panel.Ms O'Brien said: &quot;I appreciate that no one can provide full justice for any victim of abuse in childhood, but the Scottish Government is anxious to enable victims to tell us what happened to them and the impact it had on their lives. The Inquiry panel will try to identify any lessons from past failures which will help to keep our children safe in the future.&quot;

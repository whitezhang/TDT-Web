EAST and West will come together next month with a spectacular performance to mark the 25th anniversary of the Glasgow Mela.The Red Hot Chilli Pipers will join forces with flamboyant Punjabi drummers Sain Tanveer Brother for a one off performance at Kelvingrove Park.They will entertain crowds at the annual event on Sunday June 14 with a specially commissioned piece of music.Sain Tanveer Brothers' performance has been supported by the Lord Provost's office recognising Glasgow's twin city of Lahore in Pakistan.The Mela has already staged events in Barmulloch and at the Tramway as part of its 25th anniversary celebrations.Mela steering group chairwoman, Councillor Soryia Siddique, said: &quot;The Glasgow Mela has grown and flourished beyond the wildest dreams of everyone who organised, performed and attended that first edition at Tramway 25 years ago.&quot;It remains a celebration of the city's incredibly rich and diverse communities and provides an outstanding opportunity for everyone to come together and celebrate our shared cultures.&quot;Over the last 25 years, we have seen many positive changes in our great city and the Glasgow Mela reflects, through art and culture, our city's incredible friendliness and inclusion.&quot;Glasgow's first Mela was held in 1990 as part of the European City of Culture and was an indoor celebration at the then newly opened Tramway.It was also staged in Queens Park and Glasgow Green before moving to Kelvingrove Park.Over the years the Meal has grown to a massive outdoor event which attracts tens of thousands of visitors and hundreds of artists and performers from all over the world.Coming from the Sanskrit word meaning to meet, the Mela reflects the many cultures of the city and has become one of the highlights of its cultural calendar.Performances will be staged throughout the day and visitors will be able to enjoy dozens of stalls selling a wide range of food as part of Scotland's Year of Food and Drink.

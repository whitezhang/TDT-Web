SCOTS comics are set to stage Britain’s highest comedy gig.
The gig will take place this bank holiday Monday at 3196ft above sea level on the summit of Ben Lomond, Scotland’s most southerly Munro.
Featuring five award winning Scottish comedians, the gig will raise money for the charities Scottish Mountain Rescue and Trossachs Search and Rescue Dogs.
Gary Little and Mark Nelson - the past two winners of Best Headliner at the Scottish Comedy Awards will be joined by BBC Scotland Scot Squad’s Chris Forbes, Vladimir McTavish and Alan Anderson.
Gary, Chris and Alan are regular Munro Baggers as is Vladimir, who recently performed an Edinburgh Fringe show about the late Tom Weir Mark. Until now the highest Mark Nelson has climbed is the stairs at Hampden to watch his beloved Queen of the South.
 

Organiser Alan Anderson said “The idea for the gig came about after meeting the Trossachs team and the dogs at Glasgow Stands Up For The Clutha fundraiser.
 

The comics were all shocked that they received no state funding for their worthy work.
As keen hillwalkers we wanted to do something to raise funds for them, and also those from Scottish Mountain Rescue, who give up their time and put themselves at risk in order to keep us safe when on the hills.”
“Bank Holiday Monday is typically the busiest day on Ben Lomond. Hopefully the sun will come out and so will people’s cash.”
 

“The hardest part of the day isn’t going to be making the climbers laugh. Because the gig is outdoors and miles from the nearest power source we have to carry our PA system with up and down the mountain
The gig will take place on Monday 25th May at 2pm on the summit of Ben Lomond. No tickets are required, just walk up the mountain and donate some money at the top.

A SCHOOLGIRL who posted pictures of herself on Facebook hours before her death was being mourned by friends and family last night.
Aaliyah Sutherland, 13, was rushed to hospital after police were called to a house in Galashiels in the Borders on Sunday evening.
But the popular teenager was pronounced dead at Borders General.
Her parents Lisa Bond and Ben Sutherland, who divorced in 2009, have been left distraught by their daughter’s death.
And it sparked an outpouring of grief from her devastated friends.
Earlier on Sunday, Aaliyah, a second-year pupil at Earlston High School, had posted a selfie online.
Lisa, 32, was being comforted by family at her mother Libby’s home in Galashiels yesterday.
Lisa, who also has a 15-year-old daughter, Keira, did not want to speak about her loss.
Ben, 30, who lives in Galashiels and works for his father Raymond’s roofing firm, changed his Facebook profile on Monday to a photo of himself with his smiling daughter.
Dozens of his friends took to his Facebook page to leave their condolences.
It is understood Aaliyah took her own life and police said there were no suspicious circumstances.
Fellow pupils and staff at Earlston are being offered support in the wake of the tragedy, Scottish Borders Council said.
On social media, friends expressed their grief after her death.
One wrote: “Aaliyah, truly heartbreaking losing someone so young and with such a bright future.”
A girl who described Aaliyah as her “best friend” said: “I don’t want to believe you are gone.”

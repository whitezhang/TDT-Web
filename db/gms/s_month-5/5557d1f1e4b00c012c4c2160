 Kilmarnock manager Gary Locke indicated he had no problem with Josh Magennis's apparent head-butt on team-mate Jamie Hamill. 
 The two appeared to come together in the first half of Kilmarnock's 4-1 win over Partick Thistle. 
 &quot;That just shows two boys who are committed and want to win,&quot; Locke told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;That's what we needed today and that's what we got. Quite happy with that as long as we win. 
 &quot;Players will argue on the football pitch, but that's the kind of desire I want in the teams I manage.&quot; 
 Locke admitted he had been having &quot;sleepless nights&quot; as the threat of relegation had hovered over his club. 
 The Rugby Park side finally secured their top-flight status with the win, consigning Motherwell to a relegation play-off. 
 &quot;Obviously we're delighted to make sure that we stay in the league but I don't think it's anything to celebrate,&quot; he said. 
 &quot;We're disappointed with the run that we've been on. 
 &quot;It's a relief. I'm glad we've set the record straight. 
 &quot;We were in a position a couple of months ago where we should never have found ourselves in this position today.&quot; 
  Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald  felt the scoreline was harsh on his side, but that they had paid the price for their defending at set-pieces. 
 He said: &quot;There wasn't a lot in it, we probably had the better of the ball, but we can't defend the way we defended. 
 &quot;The set-plays and obviously the penalty have changed the game totally. It's been a bit of a wake-up call because we know how important set-plays are in football, they're fine margins. 
 &quot;They didn't down tools today, they just didn't defend properly. The players over the course of the season have been very good and we want to go out with a victory next week at Motherwell.&quot;

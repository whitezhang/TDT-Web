POLICE have revealed they are hunting 900 gangsters across Scotland’s biggest city.
Detectives have already arrested 570 Glasgow gangsters and seized more than &pound;13million in illegal assets. They have identified more than 40 gangs in the city who “employ” around 900 people.
These mobs are engaged in drugs, prostitution, money laundering, tobacco smuggling, counterfeit goods, extortion and the use of legitimate businesses across all sectors.
Detective Superintendent Andy Gunn, head of the Organised Crime Unit in Glasgow, said: “Serious and organised criminals are driven by power and profit.
“All they care about is making money and the consequences of crimes, such as drug dealing and human trafficking, are irrelevant to them.
“They will identify a weakness in an individual or community and capitalise on that.
“There is absolutely no conscious involved in what do, they don’t care about the risk or harm to other people. They only care about profit.”
He added: “Organised crime is present in every community in Glasgow.
“And in all of those communities, there are different issues which need to be tackled.”

A convicted murderer has failed to return to prison after unescorted leave in Glasgow.James Lieser, 38, did not return to HMP Greenock on Friday and was last seen by his family in Parkhead, Glasgow, at about 3.30pm that day.Lieser was convicted in 2004 of murdering Steven Collins and had served 11 years of a 12-year sentence.Police Scotland appealed for anyone with information on Lieser's whereabouts to contact them.Five years ago he lost an appeal against his conviction over the murder of Steven Collins in Parkhead, Glasgow.The court had heard that that prior to the murder on August 23, 2003 the Lieser had made certain threats, apparently arising out of a family dispute, extending to threats to stab and kill Collins if he was found in Parkhead.Lieser did not dispute that he stabbed and killed Collins, but claimed he was acting in self-defence fearing he was going to be stabbed.Lawyers acting for Lieser also claimed that the judge in the trial had misdirected the jury by suggesting Lieser had to have a reasonable belief that he was under attack.

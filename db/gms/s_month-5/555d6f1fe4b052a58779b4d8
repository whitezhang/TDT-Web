THE hugely popular Glasgow Show has been scrapped by hard up council bosses.In past years, the two day event on Glasgow Green has been attended by up to 70,000 people .Last year it was put on hold because of the Commonwealth Games as Glasgow Green was used as a Live Zone.But the Evening Times has learned a decision has been taken to scrap the Show which has been a highlight of summer in the city.A city council spokesman said: &quot;After a review of all the summer events in the city's parks was carried out earlier this year, a decision was taken to continue the programme without the Glasgow Show.&quot;The city will still host a fantastic series of events in our parks this summer, including the Summer Sessions, the World Pipe Band Championships and Proms in the Park.&quot;The first Glasgow Show was held in 2004 and for more than a decade has been a firm favourite with city residents of all ages.It has attracted headline performers like The Drifters and talent show favourites like Olly Murs, Darius, Rylan Clark and Amelia Lily.As well as the music stage, visitors could also choose from the main arena, countryside zone, horticultural marquee, children's arena and the market village.Two years ago, the main arena featured the Blazing Saddles stunt team, the Royal Signals motorcycle display team and the Tigers Freefall Parachute Team.Calton Labour councillor George Redmond admitted he was disappointed the council had been forced to cancel the Glasgow Show.He said: &quot;I am disappointed because it is a great event and thousands of Glaswegians look forward to it.&quot;It just shows the challenges the council is now experiencing that we are having to cancel events that thousands of people enjoy.&quot;Here is an example where the cuts to Glasgow's budget are directly impacting on local people.&quot;

ED Miliband came to Scotland to rally his party as the election campaign entered its final week.The Labour leader came to Glasgow amid accusations his refusal to work with the SNP will lead to a Tory Government.Mr Miliband gave a speech at Tollcross Leisure centre at the rally introduced by Taggart and Coronation Street actor John Michie.Scottish Leader Jim Murphy, Glasgow east candidate Margaret Curran and Scottish deputy leader Kezia Dugdale also addressed the gathering.Mr Miliband said...Scottish Labour leader, Jim Murphy, was out speaking to business owners and managers in Paisley to assure them Labour was a party that supported business.He said: &quot;We know that jobs in this country rely on the trade and movement that comes from being part of the UK and part of the EU - but our memberships of both could be put to a vote if Scotland votes SNP, and the Tories hold on to Downing Street.&quot;We have seen on other parts of the world the effect constantly rerunning referendums can have on jobs and investment, Scotland doesn't need that.&quot;Referendums cannot be the priority for Scotland over the next five years. We need to be talking about how we grow our economy and create more jobs. Good jobs, not low paying jobs on zero hours contracts that barely give Scots a chance to get by, never mind get on in life.&quot;Meanwhile Nicola Sturgeon continued a final week helicopter tour of Scotland seeking to get her party's MPs elected over Labour.Ms Sturgeon saidMr Miliband had said: &quot;I'm not going to have Labour government if it means deals or coalitions with the SNP.&quot;Ms Sturgeon said the Labour leader was being pushed around by the Tory campaign and strengthened the SNP.She said: &quot;If the opinion polls in recent days have made anything clear, it is that Scotland has an unrivalled opportunity to make our voice heard at Westminster like never before.&quot;Ed Miliband's disastrous revelation that he would rather let the Tories back in than work with the SNP to keep them out will galvanise even more people to vote SNP. &quot;Scottish Conservative Leader, Ruth Davidson, appealed to disaffected Labour and LibDem voters to back the Tories.Ms Davidson boosted by an increase in the polls by five points, said: &quot;The Scottish Conservatives are speaking to Scots right across the political spectrum who want to unite around two big things.&quot;Firstly, a complete guarantee is that we will never do anything to put our country at risk.&quot;She added:&quot;I know many people voted Lib Dem or Labour in the past and are now looking at those parties and wondering what to do.&quot;My message to all those people is that the Scottish Conservatives are on the up, we have the momentum going into this election, and we can represent your values, and fulfil your aspirations.&quot;The LibDems leader Willie Rennie was campaigning at a charity animal shelter claiming the SNP government in Scotland has been &quot;chaos&quot;.He said: &quot;It is clear that voting SNP is the chaotic choice in this election.&quot;It is the only choice on offer in Scotland which threatens a move towards a second referendum. People remember well how the SNP took its eye off the ball on day to day services whilst it focused on its referendum campaign.&quot;As a result, college places were cut, the police went into chaos and mental health waiting times were missed.&quot;

A VETERAN who suffers from post traumatic stress disorder has been unable to wash himself or cook meals in his own home for three weeks after delays to a planned refit.Sanctuary Housing Association sent in contractors to tear out David McClymont's kitchen and bathroom as part of an upgrade which was expected to last ten days.However, the 52-year-old former soldier has been living on takeaways and taking buses to a relative's house to get washed since the beginning of last month.Sanctuary is replacing kitchens and bathrooms at 21 properties in Pollok and dozens of residents are believed to have been left without running water and cooking facilities.Mr McClymont served in the army for eleven years with the Royal Highland Fusiliers, taking part in several tours of Northern Ireland at the height of The Troubles.He was also one of the soldiers sent to the aftermath of the Lockerbie plane crash to collect body parts.Mr McClymont said: &quot;During my time in the army I saw two mates have their legs blown off and there was a boy killed right in front of me. I also body bagged the dead bodies in Lockerbie.&quot;I usually go to Combat Stress (a veterans' mental health charity) to deal with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) and I go to the Coming Home Centre for my lunch.&quot;But Mr McClymont has been unable to go to the vital services that support him because tradesmen require constant access.He said: &quot;Most of the time I'm stuck in the house and the doctor had to increase my medication this week because I'm not getting any sleep with of all this hassle with the house.&quot;They were meant to do my kitchen and bathroom in two weeks and this is the third week.&quot;Everybody in the whole scheme is cracking up with it all because the houses are not getting done.&quot;I've not had a cooker, a washing machine, a bath or shower in that house for three weeks. They ripped it all out, the kitchen, the toilet, the bath, everything.&quot;I'm going to my relative's house for a shower and they're doing all my washing. I have to buy takeaway meals because I don't even have any sockets to plug in my microwave.&quot;I should be getting compensation for this but they've been coming round trying to get me to sign a letter saying I'm happy with the work.&quot;A letter from site manager Phil Dickov to residents, seen by the Evening Times, said: &quot;The works that are taking place was originally expected to take ten days to complete. We would like to apologise as this is now taking 15 working days to complete.&quot;The reason for this is that we are plastering all walls and ceilings so that we can give your walls a smooth finish. The plastering is taking three to four days to dry in areas, and this in turn is having a knock on effect for other trades.&quot;Sanctuary Scotland director Gordon Laurie said: &quot;We are sorry Mr McClymont has been inconvenienced while we make extensive improvements to his home.&quot;However, it is impossible to replace people's kitchens and bathrooms without any disruption.&quot;The work at Mr McClymont's home is on schedule to complete on Monday. This is within the 15 working day period Mr McClymont was told in writing by our contractor.&quot;At no point during the course of this work has Mr McClymont been left without washing facilities. Six other properties have been completed to date and everyone's been delighted with the finished product.&quot;

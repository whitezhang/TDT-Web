The 44-year-old, from Aberdeen, will take up her role as a vocal coach at the Glasgow school for music, drama and dance in the next academic session.
Milne has performed in many of the world's finest opera houses, opera companies and festivals.

&quot;I am delighted to be joining the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland,&quot; she said.
&quot;I'm looking forward to working in such a vibrant and world-leading musical environment. 
&quot;As an alumna of the RCS, I appreciate the training that goes on behind the scenes and I cannot wait to get started, working colleagues and students to ensure the continued visibility of the RCS's reach nationally and internationally.&quot;
Milne was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2005 for services to opera and music.
The renowned recitalist has appeared at the Aix-en-Provence, Edinburgh and City of London festivals, the Oxford Lieder Festival, London's Wigmore Hall, the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, and at the Schumannfeste in Dusseldorf.

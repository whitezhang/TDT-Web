 A HEARTBROKEN widower was left stunned by an NHS blunder after a delivery driver returned his late wife’s belongings – eight years after she died. 
John Dewar, 93, answered the door of his home to a man who held up two bags and said: “Agnes Dewar?”
John, whose wife died of a heart attack in 2007 at the age of 85, a week after a biopsy on her knee, said: “It shook me to my core.
“One of the bags looked like it contained some kind of electrical equipment, with clothing in the other.
“I told him Agnes had died in 2007 and he was very apologetic. He seemed shaken as well.”
John, from Dumfries, was so distressed by the incident that he asked the man to leave and take the bags with him.
 

An NHS spokeswoman yesterday admitted that the delivery had been made by mistake and said the bags didn’t even contain Agnes’s possessions.
She said: “We can confirm that an attempt was made, in error, to deliver equipment intended for a separate patient to this address.
“We apologise for the error and for the distress caused. We can offer an assurance that this was in no way connected to Mr Dewar or his late wife.”
But John told our sister paper the Dumfries and Galloway Standard: “I think that’s a lot of rubbish. They have an answer for everything.
“The man came to my house and said my wife’s name. I’m completely baffled.”

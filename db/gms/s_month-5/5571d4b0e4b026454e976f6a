 A HAIRDRESSER accused of cutting her partner’s willy with a pair of scissors was dramatically cleared today after the victim failed to appear in court. 
 Helen Smith appeared at Dunfermline Sheriff Court charged with grabbing former partner Stuart Cooper’s penis before snipping it on August 26 last year. 
In a shock twist, the 48-year-old was found not guilty after the Crown failed to make their main witness, Mr Cooper, appear.
 He was described as a “reluctant witness” who made no complaint or statement to the police following the assault at their shared home in Cardenden, Fife . 
Helen refused to comment as she left the court accompanied by relatives today but when asked about the judgement, brother-in-law Alex Milne said: “It’s braw.”
The 55-year-old said: “She’s a quiet woman, a nice woman. She rarely has a boyfriend. He was a drinker and was carrying on and that.
“She’s been found not guilty. It’s braw. They were together for about a year. He’s not around anymore, he’s away to somewhere in England or so I’ve heard.”
Defence lawyer Yvonne McKenna said the court proceedings had placed an “enormous pressure” on Miss Smith, who was a first time offender.
She added: “The complainer wrote to my office in September and he made it clear he did not inform the police and made no statement to the police.
“He had no wish for this matter to proceed.”
She said her client had been suffering from a “depressive illness” at the time of the incident and she had been left unable to work for a period of time.
Police were called to the couple’s shared home by worried neighbours who heard screaming during the bust up last year.
Paramedics also raced to the scene to treat Stuart for his injuries however the extent of the damage is unknown.

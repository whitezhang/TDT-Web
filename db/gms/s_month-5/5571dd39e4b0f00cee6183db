POLICE were called in after an alleged attempt at election fraud at Glasgow east.
The alarm was raised after a vigilant polling clerk noticed the same name being used twice.
A Glasgow City Council spokesman said: &quot;A vote was cast in the name of one person and duly scored off but another voter later appeared and tried to vote using the same details.
&quot;The ballot paper has been isolated and it will be placed into an evidence bag and handed over top police at the count.&quot;

Scottish Business Insider is to host a business breakfast event to discuss Scotland and the UKâ€™s future in the Europe.
The event, which will be held on May 28 at Skypark in Glasgow, will discuss the pro's and con's in remaining a member of the EU, red tape and the effect it has on businesses working within the EU, legal frameworks and how those affect business and potential reforms of the EU.
The breakfast event will look at the political permeations following the UK General Election.
In the run-up to the General Election the Conservatives have promised a referendum on UK membership of the European Union while Labour have stated they would only hold a referendum if the EU sought to transfer more powers from the UK to Brussels.
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has argued being forced out of the EU by a UK exit referendum would threatens Scottish jobs.
The Scotland's Future in Europe event will feature an expert panel to discuss all these questions and more.
The panel has yet to be finalised, though CBI Scotland director Hugh Aitken has been confirmed as a panel member.

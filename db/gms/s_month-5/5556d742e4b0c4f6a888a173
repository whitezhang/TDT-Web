THE WEIRD, wild and wonderful descended upon the Arches this week as Make Up Mayhem came to town.The event - a fabulous showcase of work by West College Scotland's make-up artistry students - lived up to its name as the audience was transported to a fantasy land full of myths and monsters.Karen McIlvenna, the college's Hairdressing, Beauty and Make-up Artistry Head of Sector, said: &quot;Events like this give our students the chance to showcase their skills, by transforming models using a mix of fashion-led and special effects cosmetics.&quot;The students were given 24 weeks to prepare a fantasy, period or prosthetic special effect character of their choice using the skills and techniques learned throughout their three years of study.&quot;They all worked extremely hard and the event was a huge success - the standard of work produced by each of the students was incredible. They truly wowed the audience.&quot;We are exceptionally proud of them - they are a credit to themselves and the college and I'm in no doubt that they will go on to successful careers within the make-up Industry.&quot;More than 80 students from all over Scotland and beyond took part in the show.Magdalena Kulig, 32, who is originally from Poland and now lives in Yoker, said: &quot;I have had an amazing two years at the Clydebank campus and the course has given me the drive to succeed.&quot;I'm now going onto further my studies at Bolton University and eventually I'd like to work in special effects and TV/set make-up.&quot;Babs Clubb, 41, who is from Shetland, said: &quot;I've been waiting my entire life to do this course as I got into make up when I was really young.&quot;&quot;It's my dream to work in television and film. The lecturers have been just great and they are so knowledgeable. They have tons of REAL industry experience so know what they are talking about.The prosthetics was my favourite unit by far.&quot;Dani Dewsbury, 21, from Aberdeen, joined the WCS course after graduating from art school in her home city.She said: &quot;I wanted to do something else in the creative industries that would really challenge me and the course at WCS stood out.&quot;The special effects and prosthetics were by far my favourite, but I really loved it all. People said it might be an expensive thing to do and it can be, but you just have to make it work and look for ways to use different materials.&quot;I'm hoping to go freelance and hopefully pick up momentum with my jobs. I might go to London and look into going to a private make-up artistry school - but I will see where I end up.&quot;

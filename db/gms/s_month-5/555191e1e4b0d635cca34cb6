OLDER people in the city are being invited to take a stroll down memory lane as part of a road safety awareness campaign.Elderly groups from across the city have been invited to participate in a two week long project which will take them back in time.The Elderly Pedestrian Campaign has been organised by Glasgow City Council's road safety team in a bid to raise awareness of the changes in traffic over the years.Pupils from St Paul's primary in Whiteinch and their grandparents visited Riverside Museum to take part in a competition involving characters from the 'Broons'.Cardboard cut-outs were placed around the museum with a road safety message attached and the older people and their grandchildren had to find them and the message.Alistair Watson, the city council's sustainability and transport spokesman, said: &quot;We are determined to make every effort to reduce the number of elderly people injured on our roads today.&quot;The number of older people killed or seriously injured on Glasgow's roads has been falling steadily over the past decade.&quot;However, there is still a disproportionate number of older pedestrians killed compared to other age groups.&quot;This year alone, four of the five recorded fatalities have been older pedestrians so we really want to see improvements.&quot;Events such as this highlight the importance of raising awareness and understanding of road safety issues for our more senior citizens in a light hearted way.&quot;It also gives us an opportunity to talk about the different types of safer crossing facilities which have been installed on our streets across the city to assist pedestrians crossing busy roads.&quot;A film of Glasgow in the 1950s gives an overview of the people trade, culture and transport in use at the time.The council is working closely with Police Scotland and other agencies to make the experience memorable and Strathclyde Fire and Rescue had firefighters were in attendance as well as an information stall in the museum.Over the next two weeks, Time Traveller packs will be given to all primary 5, 6 and 7 pupils to take home to older family members so they can look at road safety over the years in a fun way.There will be an online competition which will collect data on older people's behaviour and the issues they face.Road safety staff and junior road safety officers from schools will travel around the city on a vintage bus stopping at health centres, libraries and shopping centres to hand out advice and road safety information to older people.And police will visit elderly people's lunch clubs with a road safety presentation.

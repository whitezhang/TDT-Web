A HITMAN was today jailed for life after being convicted of the murder of gangland figure Kevin "Gerbil" Carroll which a judge described as an "execution in a public car park."Thirty-five-year-old William Paterson&nbsp;was found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow after almost three weeks of being on trial.Paterson denied murdering Mr Carroll, 29, by gunning him down at the Asda car park in Robroyston, Glasgow, on January 13, 2010.He claimed he was at his girlfriend Sarah Maguire's house in Linn Gardens, Cumbernauld at the&nbsp;time of the shooting but the jury rejected his alibi.He was convicted of murder and a number of firearms charges.Passing a minimum sentence of 22 years behind bars Judge Lord Armstrong told Paterson: &quot;On the evidence this court has heard this murder appears to have been premeditated, planned carried out by you and others in the most calculated way.&quot;It was not a spontaneous event which happened in the spur of the moment, it was in effect an execution.&quot;He said Carroll was murdered in the &quot;most vicious and brutal&quot; way. The judge added that it was carried out in a public car park where &quot;ordinary members of the public were going about their everyday business&quot; and &quot;put at risk of gunfire&quot;.

A MAN has admitted sexually assaulting a woman on a flight from Scotland.
Andrew Tosh, 34, from Dundee, was detained when the flight from Glasgow to Dalaman in Turkey, was forced to land at Gatwick after reports of a ‘disturbance’ on board.
The Thomas Cook flight diverted to the London airport after reports of at least two passengers ‘involved in trouble’ on board the aircraft.
But it has emerged that the decision was taken to land the flight at Gatwick after the pilot and cabin crew became concerned at Tosh’s behaviour.
Cabin crew reportedly asked passengers to help restrain Tosh, who admitted being drunk on board an aircraft during a court appearance.
Tosh also admitted sexual assault, threatening behaviour and assault, and was released on conditional bail and ordered to attend Lewes Crown Court on June 11.
Fellow passenger Jimmy Costello told the Evening Telegraph that he had helped restrain Tosh as the plane began its descent to Gatwick.
He added: “The cabin crew started moving the people who were seating behind him and they spoke to him, trying to keep him calm.
“People were saying that he was a bad flyer and that he got really nervous. It was arranged to divert the plane. As we were coming down he was shouting that we were going to crash.
“It was an all female cabin crew and they had asked if I would help them to restrain the passenger if things got out of hand.
“I held his wrists against his chest and I held him down until the plane landed.”
Meanwhile, a man has been fined &pound;1,000 after he admitted endangering an aircraft after got drunk and took over the tannoy system on a flight from Manchester to Aberdeen to sing karaoke.
Graham Leonard was returning on a charter flight after attending a Manchester United match at Old Trafford when he hijacked the flight’s intercom.
He later caused part of Aberdeen International Airport to be evacuated after he set off a fire alarm.

Schoolchildren are risking their lives by taking part in a deadly social media craze nicknamed the 'Paracetamol Challenge'.
The bizarre game apparently involves encouraging young people to abuse over-the-counter painkillers.
Police and schools have sent warnings home to parents about the potentially lethal challenge which is being spread via Facebook and Instagram.
The first cases are believed to have happened in Ayrshire, Scotland, and reportedly led to one teenager ending up in hospital.

Even a small overdose of painkillers can cause serious health problems, medics warn.
Parents are being urged to keep an eye on their children's social media profiles for any sign of them taking part in the game.
Alan Ward, head of schools at East Ayrshire Council, said he was first contacted by police in March.

He told The Scotsman: &quot;The challenge results in young people daring each other, through Instagram and Facebook, to take excessive amounts of paracetamol and this is a matter of great concern.
&quot;We are urging parents to talk to their children about the potential dangers of taking paracetamol and to discourage their children from engaging in any online activity in support of this dangerous craze.&quot;
The warning comes following fears over another playground craze which involved children making themselves go unconscious.
One mum told how her eight-year-old daughter passed out playing the potentially deadly 'Sleeper' craze last month.

MORE patients will be treated at the Golden Jubilee Hospital after the Scottish Government allocated an extra Â£1.5m for staff and treatments.Surgeons at the Clydebank hospital will carry out more eye, and joint operations to help reduce waiting times around the country.More older people with eye and joint problems have put pressure of hospitals across the country with demand for treatments and surgery increasing.The money will see more staff recruited and will enable more operations to be carried out at the weekends.Shona Robison, Health Secretary, announced the cash which she said was aimed at getting patients seen and treated as soon as possible, with an emphasis on procedures for older people.The hospital will carry out another 1200 cataract operations, an additional 150 hip and knee replacements and another 200 foot and ankle procedures.Ms Robison said: &quot;We know how important it is for patients to be treated quickly. Waiting times remain amongst their lowest ever levels, and we want to keep it that way.&quot;That is why we are investing this money in increasing capacity at the Golden Jubilee, and this will also help enable boards to reduce their use of the private sector.&quot;With an ageing population the NHS in Scotland is facing different challenges to a decade ago and we have seen a significant increase in the number of people needing cataract operations and joint procedures.&quot;The investment and expansion means the Golden Jubilee will carry out an even greater share of surgical and orthopaedic procedures in Scotland, with patients referred from health boards across the country.Jill Young, Chief Executive of the Golden Jubilee National Hospital, said: &quot;Once again we are delighted that even more patients will have access to our high quality services.&quot;This further expansion of the Golden Jubilee solidifies our position as the largest elective orthopaedic centre in Scotland, providing an expert role in both simple and complex conditions. We are also now one of the largest providers of Ophthalmology in Scotland.&quot;The hospital currently carries out around 4500 hip and knee operations allowing health boards to meet waiting times targets.

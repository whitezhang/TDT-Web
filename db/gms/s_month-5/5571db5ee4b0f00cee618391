FEARS were growing last night for a murdered toddler’s dad who has been missing since Sunday night.
Craig Moverley, 46, described as “vulnerable” by police, was last seen in Inverness.
His 17-month-old daughter Karisha White was killed by brutal Allan Rennie in 1996.
Friends say Craig has never got over her death and they are pleading with him to get in touch and let them know where he is.
Bricklayer Rennie, 47, battered the defenceless tot to death while high on drink and drugs after rowing with his partner, Karisha’s mother Samantha White.
Pathologist Dr Jeanette McFarlane told the murder trial in 1997 that the injuries were among the worst she had ever seen.
She compared the little girl’s wounds to the damage which would have been caused if a “car had driven over a child’s head”.
Sentencing Rennie, judge Lord Macfadyen described it as a “dreadful murder” and jailed him for life.
 

Craig, who was last seen in the Kinmylies/Charleston area of the city at about 11pm on Sunday, has family in Shetland and England.
He moved from Shetland with his then partner Samantha to start a new life in the Ayrshire town of Girvan in 1995. But when the couple’s three-year relationship ended, she started seeing Rennie.
The thug killed Karisha after a blazing argument with Samantha. Rennie later tried to blame her for the toddler’s death.
 

Police said they were “anxious” to trace Craig, who suffers from balance problems which may make him look drunk.
He is described as slim, clean shaven, about 5ft 8ins with dark brown hair in a pony tail.
Craig has an English accent and was last seen wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.
It’s thought he may have also been wearing a black hooded waterproof jacket.
Police are keen to hear of any sightings. A spokesman said: “Anyone who may have information regarding Craig’s whereabouts is asked to contact police on 101.”

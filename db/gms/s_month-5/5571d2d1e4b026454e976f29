A ROMANTIC couple's cappuccino turned out a lot hotter than they bargained for.
A barista attempted to draw a pretty leaf pattern in the foam but the result ended up looking extremely phallic.
Stu Turner and Paula Binney, who paid for the &pound;2.70 coffee at a cafe in Edinburgh, have rudely renamed the drink a &quot;cockuccino&quot;.
Stu, from Glossop, Derbyshire, and Paula, from Salford, Greater Manchester, popped into the Hula Juice Bar and Gallery in Edinburgh's Grassmarket.
Stu, 42, ordered a cappuccino but could hardly believe the results of the &quot;latte art&quot;.
&quot;It was very seriously put in front of me and I just sat there for a bit and then I noticed it so I stared at it.
&quot;I thought - is it just me? But Paula said no, she saw it as well.&quot;
The photographer explained: &quot;I drank around the 'member'. I just sort of avoided it. I didn't mention it to the staff.
&quot;But I'd definitely go back. I'd like to see what we get next.&quot;
Paula, 40, said: &quot;Stu was just looking down - he had a grin on his face and was pointing out this thing in his coffee.&quot;I said, 'Would you like cream with that sir?'&quot;

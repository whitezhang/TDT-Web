WOMEN in Glasgow still have a chance to enter the Cancer Research UK Race for Life on Sunday.
Registration closes at the end of the day on Thursday, May 7, to join the “pink army” of thousands running the 5k at Glasgow Green from 9.30am on Sunday.
Lisa Adams, spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK in Scotland said: “We’ve had amazing levels of support from Scotland in the past and we’d like to thank all the dedicated Scots who help us.
“But we urgently need more of you to join our pink army and help beat cancer sooner. Cancer is the one thing that can’t wait. Our scientists are at the forefront of the battle against cancer and we need a formidable army of women to help them do that. And we need them to do it now. I can’t stress enough how important Race for Life is for funding our research across Scotland and beyond.”
Cancer Research UK’s Race for Life, in partnership with Tesco, is an inspiring women-only series of 5k, 10k marathon and Pretty Muddy events which raises millions of pounds every year bringing forward the day when all cancers are cured.
Scotland’s first Race for Life 5K of this year kicks off in Glasgow - home to the Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute - on May 10 closely followed this spring by events across the country.
Every participant receives a donation bag, along with a Gift Aid form, as part of their Race for Life entry pack. Just by completing the form and popping it in their bag, women can boost the value of their donation by an extra 25 per cent.

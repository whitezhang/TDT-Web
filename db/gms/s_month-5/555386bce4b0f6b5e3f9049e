A TEENAGER who raped a 91-year-old woman in her home has been locked up for 12 years.

Kriss Strachan, 18, forced his way into the pensioner’s home in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, and carried out the sex attack last July.
He repeatedly punched his elderly victim during the “cruel and degrading” act, leaving her with significant injuries.
Strachan, who was 17 at the time of the attack, was arrested after handing himself into police, stating: “It was me. I cannot believe I done it. I’m scum.”
He pleaded guilty in November and today was given an extended sentence of 19 years - meaning he will be supervised by authorities for seven years following his release from detention.
The court heard the victim managed to get to a neighbour’s house following the assault and said: “I have been attacked, he had sex with me.”
She was described as an “active and independent” woman before the assault but now often talks about wishing she was dead.
Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Boyd said: “The consequences are truly appalling.
“I can only hope that one day you might begin to understand the full gravity of what you have done - the pain, suffering and humiliation you inflicted on this lady.”

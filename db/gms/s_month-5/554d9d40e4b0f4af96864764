A CITY library has been upgraded thanks to a bequest from the wife of a former Govan shipbuilder.Possilpark and Elder Park libraries have both undergone improvement work but are now fully open to the public.Improvements at Elder Park have included upgrading the decor and lighting and carrying out restoration on the reference room ceilings and outside railings.The work was made possible because of a &pound;90,0o00 bequest from Isabella Elder, a Govan and Glasgow philanthropist and the wife of John Elder who established a shipbuilding business which became known as the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company.,In 1885, Mrs Elder bought the land for Elder Park and provided funds to build the library which was officially opened in 1903 by another famous Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie.The building was designed by renowned Glasgow architect John Burnet who also designed the cenotaph in George Square and London's Selfridges department store as well as contributing to the design of the world famous Sydney Harbour Bridge.Elder Park library was re-opened by Lord Provost Sadie Docherty and Glasgow Life chairman Archie Graham.He said: &quot;We are delighted to offer these wonderful new facilities at Elder Park and Possilpark libraries.&quot;These outstanding community hubs provide services which bring real benefits to our citizens.&quot;Glasgow libraries enjoyed over 5.5million attendances last year and we are very grateful for the generous bequest from Isabella Elder which has done so much to help us maintain a very high standard of services to library users.&quot;Possilpark has benefitted from work to the exterior of the building and internal redecoration.The library offers a wide range of activities including a homework club and now has a new Macmillan information point to provide advice, information and support to those affected by cancer.On May 23, it will host an open day to welcome the local community back into the building.Between 11am and 3pm it will offer children's games and face painting, arts and crafts, toddlers' tales, an interactive local history workshop and an author visit.

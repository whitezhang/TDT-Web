TAKE That stars Gary Barlow and Howard Donald thrilled their fans in Scotland last week then soared to cloud nine themselves on a spectacular seaplane trip.
Gary was so impressed by the beauty of Scotland’s west coast, he posted pictures of the lochs, mountains and glens on Twitter.
Gary, Howard and bandmate Mark Owen performed a series of gigs at Glasgow’s SSE Hydro.
 

In their downtime between concerts, Gary and Howard booked a seaplane flight.
Setting off from a pontoon outside Cameron House Hotel on Loch Lomond, they took in the Kyles of Bute, Mull of Kintyre, Tighnabruaich and the islands of Arran and Mull in their aerial tour.
Gary was blown away by the scenery, posted snaps on Twitter and wrote: “This is one spectacular place #Scotland.”
David West, 58, a pilot with Loch Lomond Seaplanes, said he was thrilled to be Gary and Howard’s guide for the day.
 

 He said: “It was a delight to be their pilot. We took a trip out to the west coast and it was magnificent weather. 
“The visibility was amazing. We could see as far as the north coast of Northern Ireland.
 “When we landed, they were clapping and seemed happy – they are really nice guys.” 
After their air tour, Gary and Howard signed autographs and posed for selfies with fans who had patiently waited on them returning from their flight.

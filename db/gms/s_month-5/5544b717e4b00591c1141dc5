The Duchess of Cambridge has returned to the exclusive Lindo Wing to give birth to her second child.Each en suite room in the private maternity unit of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, has wifi, satellite television, a radio, a safe, a bedside phone and a fridge. All meals are freshly prepared in a dedicated kitchen and tea and coffee is provided for mothers and guests throughout the day.The wing also offers a &quot;comprehensive wine list should you wish to enjoy a glass of Champagne and toast your baby's arrival&quot;.Kate is likely to have opted for a suite of two rooms. The Duchess gets a 10% loyalty discount on having her second baby there, but prices have increased since Prince George was delivered almost two years ago.A suite now costs &pound;6,570 for a one-night stay with normal delivery - &pound;5,913 with Kate's 10% off - plus consultant fees of around &pound;6,000. If Kate wishes to stay for an additional night, it will cost her an extra &pound;2,300.Last time, Kate stayed for just one night. She could even be back home earlier this time if the birth goes to plan.Children are not allowed to sleep overnight so Prince George will have to remain at home with his nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, but he can visit just like two-year-old Prince William did in 1984 when Prince Harry was born.The Lindo prides itself on the privacy it offers its clients - something of paramount importance to Kate and William.&quot;Discretion is key to our service, and we will ensure that you have the space, security and privacy you need to enjoy these precious early moments as a family,&quot; its website says.Mothers have a choice of daily newspaper, which is delivered to the room each morning. Toiletries are also provided.Breakfast is served between 7.30 and 8.30am, lunch from midday until 1.30pm and the evening meal from 6pm to 7pm.Postnatal rooms come with a fully-reclining chair for partners who want to stay, and visiting hours are flexible.The Lindo Wing has an obstetric unit which caters for complex pregnancies and deliveries, as well as multiple births.It also specialises in complex trauma surgery, as well as bariatric surgery, vascular surgery, gynaecology, urology, general surgery, and ear, nose and throat procedures.The Lindo has the added benefit of being based in an NHS hospital with a premature baby ward - the Winnicott Baby Unit - if further complications arise.At the forefront of specialist care for premature babies, the Winnicott looks after some of the most critically-ill newborns in the UK.Kate is following recent royal tradition by having George and her second baby at the Lindo. William and Harry were both born there, as were Peter and Zara Phillips. Princess Michael of Kent and the Duchess of Gloucester also gave birth there.

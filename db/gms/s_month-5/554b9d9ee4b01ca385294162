AN American Airlines plane has made an emergency landing after diverting to Scotland.

The plane was travelling from Frankfurt in Germany to Dallas in the US when it experienced problems. Reports suggest a fault with an engine. 
It diverted to Glasgow Airport and landed safely just after midday.
Emergency services attended as a precaution but the aircraft landed safely.
A passenger on the flight, tweeting as @ssiekmann, wrote: “#AA71 engine went out at around 12:35 with violent wobble. Wings flexed quite a bit. Woke me up. Still on runway.”
A Glasgow Airport spokesman said: “At approximately 12.05pm, Flight AA71 operated by American Airlines travelling from Frankfurt to Dallas diverted to Glasgow Airport.
“The aircraft landed safely and was met on arrival by emergency services as a precautionary measure.
“Glasgow Airport remained open and operational throughout.”

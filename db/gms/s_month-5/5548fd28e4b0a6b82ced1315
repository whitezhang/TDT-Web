Two women have been injured after the car they were travelling in overturned in East Dunbartonshire.
Emergency services were called to the scene, on Robroyston Road in Lenzie, shortly before 10:25.
Fire crews used hydraulic cutting equipment to free the women from the car before they were treated by paramedics at he scene.
They were later taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. There are no details on their condition.
The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service's incident commander Allan Hunter said: &quot;The car was lying on its right side, meaning the driver was at the bottom and the passenger was suspended by her seatbelt. 
&quot;One of our firefighters went inside to provide emergency care while we worked to safely extricate them. 
&quot;It was a challenging operation due to the position of the car against a raised embankment. By removing the vehicle's pillars we created a roof flap, which gave ourselves and the paramedics space to lift them out on rescue boards.&quot;

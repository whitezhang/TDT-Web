SCOTLAND'S favourite lager has teamed up with a collective of up and coming young talent for a bit of a laugh.
Tennent's Lager is supporting a group of young Scottish writers, directors and animators who have created a Youtube series of comedy sketches around the fictional town of Wellpark.
The sketches - each around 30 to 60 seconds long - will be updated regularly throughout the summer.
 

The first batch include pals, Bobby and Paul pondering in the pub about how much is umpteen and a talking dog revealing his free pass to go anywhere he likes.
&quot;We wanted to develop something ambitious,&quot; said Jordan McKenna who is based at Tennent's Wellpark Brewery.
&quot;It needed to be funny but also very different.
 

&quot;Nothing was off the table idea wise as long as it was something that tapped into the humour of everyday life in Scotland.&quot;
The core creative group include Bright Signals from Finnieston and Something Something from Leith.
The sketches will be released from now until the end of July.

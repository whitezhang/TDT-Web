A man has appeared in court charged with raping a 20-year-old woman in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire.
John Ryan is alleged to have attacked the woman in a wooded area near Castle Gate as she walked home from the town's train station at 22:15 on 24 March.
The 34-year-old, from nearby Bothwell, appeared from police custody at Hamilton Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
Mr Ryan made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. He is expected to appear in court again next week.

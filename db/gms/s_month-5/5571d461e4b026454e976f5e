A WOMAN driver who caused the death of two men avoided jail yesterday after a judge told her she would have to live with the guilt for the rest of her life.
Sheriff Graham Buchanan said Elizabeth-Anne Dixon’s “momentary lapse of attention” caused a horror crash that cost the lives of top scientists Dr Stewart Rhind, 61, and Dr Julian Dawson, 42.
But he said he was satisfied that he did not have to send the mum of two to prison as it would only add to the heartache felt by those affected by the incident.
The tragedy happened after Dixon, 35, failed to spot a fellow motorist when she joined one of Scotland’s busiest trunk roads from the central reservation of a staggered junction.
The driver of the other car was forced to swerve out of her way and skidded across the central reservation before colliding with an oncoming car carrying the researchers.
Dr Rhind and Dr Dawson, who worked for the Hutton Institute in Aberdeen, were fatally injured in the crash on the A90 Dundee to Aberdeen road on March 8, 2013.
Their deaths were described at the time as an “immense loss” to Scottish science.
At Aberdeen Sheriff Court, Dixon, who had previously admitting causing death by careless driving, broke down in tears as she faced the families of the two scientists.
Sheriff Buchanan said: “This was a devastating incident – devastating for many people, particularly the two men who lost their lives and their families.
“The guilt you have will stay with you for the rest of your life.
“It is plain that you are a decent person who has good character.
“It would only add to this tragedy if your life and the lives of your two young children would be shattered by the imposition of a custodial sentence.”
Dixon, of Auchenblae, Kincardineshire, was ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work in the community.
The NHS occupational therapist was also disqualified from driving for 16 months.

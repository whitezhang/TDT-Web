A ROYAL Navy whistleblower who branded Britain’s nuclear subs a “disaster waiting to happen” is in MoD custody after being arrested at an airport.
Able Seaman William McNeilly, 25, went AWOL last week after releasing a dossier detailing allegations about Trident submarines based at Faslane on the Clyde.
He alleged 30 safety and security flaws on the submarines and said it was “a matter of time before we’re infiltrated by a psychopath or a terrorist”.
He is understood to have been arrested at Edinburgh airport on Monday night.
The Royal Navy said: “We can confirm AB McNeilly was apprehended last night and is in the custody of Royal Navy police.
They added: “The Royal Navy disagrees with McNeilly’s subjective and unsubstantiated personal views but we take the operation of our submarines and the safety of our personnel extremely seriously and so continue to fully investigate the circumstances of this issue.”
A Facebook post thought to be from McNeilly’s brother Aaron Lewis said: “My brother is safe and well. He handed himself in last night.”
On Monday, McNeilly wrote on Facebook that he was preparing to hand himself in. He said he lacked “the resources to remain undetected”.
He wrote: “I’ll be awarded with free meals and free accommodation, in prison … There is a small chance of a pardon or a shortened sentence.”
McNeilly faces disciplinary action by the Royal Navy police and a criminal prosecution under the Official Secrets Act, which can carry a lengthy jail sentence.

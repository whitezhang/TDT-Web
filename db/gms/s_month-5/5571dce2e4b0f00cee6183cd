SOMEONE call Ace Ventura...
Animal welfare officers have been left stunned after a bearded dragon was found on a bus.
A passenger found the reptile – who has been named Blakey by Scottish SSPCA staff, after the character from On the Buses – inside a plastic pet holder in a large carrier bag on a number 20 Lothian Bus.
It runs from the Slateford area of Edinburgh to Ratho.
Blakey is now being cared for at the charity’s Edinburgh and Lothians Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre.
Animal rescue officer Fiona Thorburn said: “A passenger found Blakey inside a plastic pet carrier within a large carrier bag and alerted the driver.
 

“At this stage we can’t say for sure whether Blakey has been abandoned.
“Someone could have been transporting him and forgotten him but this seems unlikely and as far as we are aware no one has been in touch with Lothian Buses looking for him. We understand Lothian Buses will be reviewing CCTV footage.
“We would ask anyone who recognises Blakey and knows who might have owned him to contact us.”
She added: “Blakey is in good condition and is now receiving the care he needs. If he has been abandoned, we will soon be looking to find him a loving new home.”
It is not the first time the charity have rescued a creature left on a Lothian Bus. Last year they took in a kitten and in 2013 a guinea pig was left behind.

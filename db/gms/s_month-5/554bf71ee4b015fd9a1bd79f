David Cameron, UKIP and Nick Clegg's pages were targeted by election day hackers - featuring a photo of Ed Miliband, a red background and captioned 'Vote Labour.'The pages were returned to their original state within minutes, but eagle-eyed users spotted the hackers' work before it was taken down.The pages have been moved to 'semi-protection' which means that new and unregistered users cannot edit the page.Ordinarily, anyone can edit a Wikipedia page, with occasional checks on specified pages.Though it is not possible to see how many people are visiting the page at any one time, the stunt will presumably have received extra hits due to the General Election.

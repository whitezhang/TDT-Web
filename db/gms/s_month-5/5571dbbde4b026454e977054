A WOMAN was pulled into a doorway and sexually attacked as she walked along a street.
The 21-year-old victim was left extremely distressed by the ordeal in Castle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway, at around 10pm yesterday.
She was walking in Church Street when a man approached her from behind and carried out the attack.
She eventually managed to fight her attacker off and went on to get help and summon police.
Officers are now looking to trace five people who were in the area at the time in the hope that they have information which could help the investigation.
They want to speak to a group of four people who were carrying umbrellas and crossed the road at the junction of King Street and Church Street and continued along King Street.
They also want to hear from a dog walker who was walking along King Street.
The suspect is described as white, bald, between 30 and 40, around 5ft 7ins tall, with a medium build and stubble.
He was wearing blue jeans and a royal blue hooded top, with the hood down, which had white tassels on it.
Police said they have been reviewing CCTV images in an effort to glean more information about the suspect.
Detective Sergeant Stephen Bell said: &quot;A young woman has been left extremely distressed by this ordeal, she was very brave and fought her attacker off but it is imperative we trace the man responsible.
&quot;I would like to appeal, particularly to the five people who were seen in the area at that time and to anyone else who was in the vicinity to get in touch with us. It's possible you saw the suspect and thought nothing of it at the time, but if you were in the area or you have any knowledge of the suspect or crime, please do contact us.&quot;
Anyone with information is asked to call officers at Dumfries police office on the non-emergency number, 101, or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

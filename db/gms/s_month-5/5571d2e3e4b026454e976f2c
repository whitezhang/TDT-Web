LOTTERY winners Colin and Chris Weir have donated a further &pound;1 million to the SNP.
The couple, who scooped &pound;161 million on the EuroMillions in 2011, gave &pound;500,000 each to Nicola Sturgeon's party in the first three months of this year, figures from the Electoral Commission revealed.
The Weirs, who have described themselves as being &quot;lifelong supporters of independence&quot;, gifted the party &pound;1 million in September 2011 after they had hit the jackpot. They then donated a further &pound;1 million to the SNP in February last year.
Overall, the SNP, which has enjoyed rising support since last year's independence referendum, received donations totalling &pound;1,055,250 in the period January to March 2015.
The party also received &pound;48,659 of public funds, in the form of &quot;short money&quot; from the House of Commons, which is given to opposition parties to help with their costs.
In the first three months of this year political parties across the UK received just over &pound;30 million in donations, with more than &pound;15 million going to the Conservative Party and over &pound;9 million gifted to Labour.
An SNP spokeswoman said: &quot;We thank all of our donors - big and small - for contributing to the success of the party, including the historic events at the general election and consistently being ahead in the polls after eight years in government, which is a remarkable achievement.&quot;

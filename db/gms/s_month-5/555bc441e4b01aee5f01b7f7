THE jersey worn by Scottish football legend Jim Baxter in Scotland’s 2-0 win over England at Hampden in 1962 is set to go under the hammer in Glasgow next month.

The shirt, which has been on display at the Scottish Football Museum since 2012, is considered to be one of the rarest pieces of Scottish football memorabilia to come to auction in recent years, with specialists at McTear’s Auctioneers valuing it in the region of &pound;4,000.
“All memorabilia associated with Jim Baxter is guaranteed to attract interest, but an item like this is something else entirely,” said McTear’s managing director, Brian Clements. 
“’Slim Jim’ is one of the greatest Scottish footballers of all time, and his matches against England are the stuff of legend.”
Coming a year on from Scotland’s 9-3 thrashing at the hands of the Auld Enemy at Wembley, the 1962 game was Baxter’s first match against England. The match was played in front of 132,000 spectators and Baxter put in a brilliant display during the 2-0 victory. 
Mr Clements added: “Baxter’s jersey from the match is steeped in football heritage and I have no doubt it will attract a huge amount of interest from football fans at home and overseas when it goes under the hammer on  2 June.”
The jersey is being put up for sale by Scotland fan Robert Ross, who bought the item in 1992 and had it signed by Baxter in 1993. Prior to the auction, people can see the piece of sporting history at the McTear’s stand at the Ideal Home Show Scotland at Glasgow’s SECC from 22 to 25 May.

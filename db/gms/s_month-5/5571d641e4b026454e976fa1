FOOTAGE of a student protester being thrown to the ground by security staff manning a demo at Edinburgh University has been shared online.
The protest, over the institution's refusal to divest from fossil fuels, has been running for a week and around 20 students remain inside Charles Stewart House on Chambers Street in the city centre.
Outsourced security was brought in and access to the building was cut off leading to tensions rising.
The clip above was shared on YouTube on Thursday morning by protesters who have accused security of heavy handedness.
A University of Edinburgh spokesperson said: &quot;The University is aware of, and deeply regrets, the unfortunate incident that is currently being played on social media. The matter is now in the hands of the police.&quot;We continue to support the right of students to peacefully and lawfully demonstrate and the University is using private security outside its buildings in Chambers Street in order to secure the safety of staff and students during the occupation.&quot;We are constantly reviewing our security arrangements to make sure that they are appropriate to the circumstances in what is an evolving situation.&quot;
 

The University’s senior vice principal Professor Charlie Jeffery last week explained the institution’s decision not to divest from all fossil fuels.
Writing in the Guardian he said: “We will not withdraw investment without prior engagement but will seek to help tackle climate change through research and development with companies in the fossil fuel sector and beyond.”

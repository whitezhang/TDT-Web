Herald and Evening Times owner Newsquest has gained about 30 new titles after buying local newspaper publisher Romanes Media Group for an undisclosed sum.
The portfolio includes about 20 newspapers in Scotland.
They include the Greenock Telegraph, the Dunfermline Press, the East Lothian Courier, the Alloa Advertiser and the Border Telegraph.
It also has some titles in south-east England and one in Northern Ireland.
Romanes originated with the Dunfermline Press, which was founded by the Romanes family in 1859. 
Newsquest chief executive Henry Faure Walker said: &quot;Newsquest is focused on building one of the leading local multi-media publishing businesses in the UK, and I am delighted to welcome Romanes Media Group to the company. 
&quot;We operate in separate markets but this portfolio of good quality weekly titles provides a strong fit with plenty of opportunity.&quot;

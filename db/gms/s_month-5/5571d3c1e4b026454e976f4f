FORMER Scotland and Rangers star Colin Hendry has denied harassing and assaulting his ex-girlfriend.
The 49-year-old allegedly approached Sarah Kinder in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire, on April 18 and grabbed her by the arm several times.
Hendry, who lives in the town, is also said to have harassed the beautician with unwanted emails and visits to her home between March 1 and April 24.
The pair had been in a five-year relationship that ended late last year, a court heard yesterday.
Hendry started seeing Sarah after his wife Denise died in 2009 following botched cosmetic surgery.
But he allegedly refused to accept their relationship was over and “bombarded” Sarah with text messages, which led to a harassment order being made against him in February.
The former defender, who led Scotland in the 1998 World Cup, entered not guilty pleas to charges of common assault and harassment.
A one-day trial was fixed for August 3 at Blackpool Magistrates’ Court.
Hendry was bailed on condition that he doesn’t communicate with or approach Sarah.

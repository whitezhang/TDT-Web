 PUPILS sitting their Highers have been banned from wearing smart watches in a clampdown on cheating. 
 Education chiefs warned that the hi-tech devices – which can connect to the internet – would be confiscated by supervisors. 
The mini computers can be used to solve maths problems, translate languages and take photos.
 

They are the latest electronic item to be added to exam authority the SQA’s list of items banned from exams, joining mobile phones, MP3 players and iPods.
The move comes as universities across England have stopped students taking any kind of watch into exams.
 
A spokesman for City University London said: “Students are already asked to place mobile phones in a plastic wallet under their desk, so we adopted the same &shy;procedure for watches.”
A spokesman for the SQA said: “Every school or college where people are sitting SQA exams is provided with the &shy;explanatory booklet, Your Exams.
“Guidance is also provided to all exam invigilators, who are required to be vigilant to any potential malpractice.”
 A spokesman for teachers’ union, the Educational Institute of Scotland, said: “Clearly it would be inappropriate for  any pupil to gain an unfair advantage by having access to information via a smart-watch or any other web-enabled. 
“This would seem to be a common sense step to ensure fairness.”

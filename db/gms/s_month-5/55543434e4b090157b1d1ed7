A DISABLED grandad is to make a court plea for clarification on the right to die.Pollokshields resident Gordon Ross is arguing that discrimination against anyone who helps him to end his life is unfair and will take his case to the Court of Session today.The 66-year-old suffers from several serious medical conditions including Parkinsons disease, and a loss of feeling in his arms and legs.Now living in a care home in the south side, the former TV producer is wheelchair bound, cannot feed himself or attend to his personal needs.Currently he does not want to die but fears if he is unable to cope with his disability in future he will not be capable of ending his own life, and is seeking clarification on whether anyone who helps him would be charged with murder or manslaughter.He said: &quot;I believe that, as a disabled person, I am currently being discriminated against.&quot;Anyone else, in any circumstances, can choose to end their own lives at any time.&quot;Because of my disability that is something I am unable to do.&quot;I do not wish to end my life, I want it to go on as long as I can.&quot;However, if my condition deteriorates to the point that I do want to take that action, I want to know what action the law might were someone to assist me.&quot;He added that the current legal position &quot;encourages suicide&quot; and raised concerns that people who are in his situation may choose to take their own life before they want to, as they feel they would be unable to in the future.With the help of his solicitors Patrick Campbell and Co, Gordon, a member of Friends At The End (FATE), is calling upon the Lord Advocate to issue guidance to clarify whether any person who helps him end his life would be charged with an offence.Guidelines have been published in England by the Director of Public Prosecutions but do not apply to Scotland.Mr Ross's supporters are also expected to demonstrate outside the court this morning ahead of the hearing.hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

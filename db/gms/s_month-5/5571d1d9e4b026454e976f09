Tunisia international Mohsni turned around, kicked Erwin and also punched him.
Other players brawled as Mohsni was rushed to the tunnel.
BBC Radio Scotland pundit Derek Ferguson, said: “To react like that, there are no excuses. Mohsni is an embarrassment. I don’t know why Stuart McCall put him on as he has been a liability this season.”

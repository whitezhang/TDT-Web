THE video shows the command centre's journey from its construction hall in Govan this month before being installed on the under-construction carrier in Rosyth dockyard, near Edinburgh.
The world-famous royal dockyard already hosts the first QEC carrier – HMS Queen Elizabeth – and work has been underway on her sister vessel since 2011, with the carrier due to be in active service from the year 2020.
Installation of the command centre, or Forward Island (called Upper Block 07) is the latest step in the Aircraft Carrier Alliance’s work delivering the second of the Royal Navy’s largest ever warships.
At 280 metres long (longer than three football pitches) and 56 metres tall (higher than Niagara Falls), each QEC class carrier will displace more than 65,000 tonnes of water when at sea – and the Forward Island is a key part of all operations.
Construction of the iconic 680-tonne Forward Island began in December 2013.
When it left its dock hall in Govan it was driven onto a barge using a single remote control and 144 wheels beneath it at a careful half a mile per hour.
It then travelled via the Irish Sea, Lands End and the English Channel before arriving in Rosyth on Monday, May 4th to be assembled on to HMS Prince Wales.

 Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon has been named Scotland's Player of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers' Association. 
 It follows the 32-year-old's return to football with the Scottish champions last summer after more than two years out of the game through injury. 
 The ex-Sunderland keeper helped Celtic win the title and League Cup - and he also returned to the Scotland squad. 
 Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen won the PFA Scotland award. 
 Gordon, who now has 42 caps and has played 53 times this season, had not made the shortlist for the award voted on by his peers. 
 He was released by Sunderland in May 2012 after his time there was hampered by a knee injury. 
 Johansen was joined on the shortlist by Celtic team-mate Virgil van Dijk, Dundee forward Greg Stewart and Aberdeen striker Adam Rooney. 
 Inverness Caledonian Thistle midfielder Ryan Christie won the writers' young player award. 
 Gordon and Christie will receive their awards at a ceremony on Sunday.

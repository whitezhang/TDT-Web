 A SICKO who kept scores of rodents in filthy conditions before feeding them to his pet snakes is facing a prison sentence. 
 Steven Riddell, 42, bred rats and mice as food for the reptiles. But he kept 130 of them in a greenhouse cage with no access to fresh air, food or water. 
The conditions were so bad that some of the creatures were crushed by their own faeces. Three mice and 19 rats were so neglected they had to be put down. Riddell also kept rabbits in hutches covered by a tarpaulin preventing natural light and air from getting in.
 
Paisley Sheriff Court heard that the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals investigated Riddell after receiving an anonymous call.
 When staff went to his home in Erskine, Renfrewshire, last April, they were shocked by what they found. 
 A senior inspector described it as the worst case of animal cruelty she had ever seen.  Prosecutor Maureen McGovern said of the conditions: “Some rodents were housed up to 22 in a cage and many had scratch and bite wounds. 
“They were pointing their faces in and poking their noses at any hole or gaps to try and breathe fresh air.”
 
Dad-of-four Riddell admitted two charges of animal cruelty last month.
Yesterday, Sheriff Colin Pettigrew ordered him to get rid of his snakes and said: “A custodial sentence is a competent disposal for each of these charges.”
Sentence was deferred until next month.

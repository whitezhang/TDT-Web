POLICE have launched a probe after a 25-year-old man died after he is believed to have bought a so-called legal high.
The man passed away at Forth Valley Royal Hospital last Thursday after reportedly purchasing the substance from a shop in Falkirk.
The news comes as hundreds of so-called ‘head shops’ which peddle legal highs on Britain’s high streets will be forced to close as a result of new laws to be announced today.
The ban on all new synthetic drugs to be announced in the Queen’s Speech will stop the estimated 250 shops circumventing the law and selling noxious substances with impunity
Campaigners said the legal change would ‘effectively shut down’ the high street trade in legal highs.
Police Scotland confirmed they are investigating the still unexplained death of the man, from Bonnybridge, and have sent a report to the Procurator Fiscal.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “As part of Police Scotland’s commitment to keeping people safe, local officers have engaged with a number of business premises across Forth Valley and provided advice and guidance in relation to the sale of new psychoactive substances (NPS).”

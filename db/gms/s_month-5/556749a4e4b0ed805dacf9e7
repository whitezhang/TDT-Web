American rockers the Gaslight Anthem return to Glasgow next month.
And the Ticket has five pairs of tickets to give away for their show.
They’ll be at the O2 Academy in Glasgow on Monday June 9.
Last year the New Jersey foursome, famed for their blue-collar rock, released fifth album Get Hurt.
Inspired by singer Brain Fallon’s divorce from his wife of 10 years, the group tried to vary their style more on the record.
Speaking at the time, Fallon said: “It was a real working out process.
“I just said, I’m going to write what I think and what I’m dealing with at this moment.
“I don’t know if it’s the truth or if this feeling is going to last, but I’m just going to let it out. I just let it go.
“That’s what was happening, that was real.”
The Gaslight Anthem’s five albums have earned them comparisons to the likes of Bruce Springsteen and the Clash for their full-on rock ‘n’ roll, while their live shows are known for being rowdy, wild affairs.
Previous albums like The 59 Sound and Handwritten were hugely praised by critics.
We’ve got five pairs of tickets to give away to their Academy gig, which can be won by answering this simply question.

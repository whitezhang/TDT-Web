SCOTLAND'S largest bus operator has agreed a three year partnership with a leading men's cancer charity.&nbsp;Employee events are being arranged across First Glasgow's depots as well as at the company's headquarters and a new city depot after the deal was unveiled with Prostate Cancer UK.Fiona Kerr, Managing Director of First Glasgow, said: &quot;My colleagues across Greater Glasgow are very supportive of Prostate Cancer UK. These visits to our depots are a great way to raise awareness locally for this important charity and help fight against the disease.&quot;First will provide Prostate Cancer UK with valuable advertising space throughout its UK bus and rail networks which will encourage many more people to join the charity's Men United movement, for those who believe men are worth fighting for.Tam Hewitt, Prostate Cancer UK volunteer, who lives in Glasgow, said: &quot;Our partnership with First gives us an excellent platform to raise awareness of a disease that affects one in eight men.&quot;There was a great deal of interest at the employee event with many drivers keen to find out more about looking after their own health as well as family members. As it turns out, a couple of drivers have recently been treated for prostate cancer.&quot;Being aware of whether you're at higher risk of prostate cancer, and the potential signs and symptoms can make a life-saving difference. Those at higher risk include men over 50, men with a family history of the disease, and black men. Symptoms, if present, can include changes to urinary patterns or pain in your back, hips or pelvis that was not there before. If you have any worries then please don't hesitate to go to your GP or to call Prostate Cancer UK's specialist nurses.&quot;Mark Bishop, Director at Prostate Cancer UK said: &quot;It's fantastic that we were given this opportunity to meet the staff at First Glasgow. Through awareness raising events like this and by featuring on posters on buses, the charities Men United army is growing stronger - making a real different in furthering the fight against prostate cancer. We thank Tam and the staff at First Glasgow for their participation.&quot;'Know Your Prostate' credit card-sized leaflets were given to all event attendees.Anyone with concerns about prostate cancer can contact Prostate Cancer UK's Specialist Nurses in confidence on 0800 074 8383 or via the online Live chat, instant messaging service at www.prostatecanceruk.org .

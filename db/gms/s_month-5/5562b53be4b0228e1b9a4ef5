AN area of land needed to complete the missing piece of one of Scotland's Victorian jewels could be sold for Â£6.3million.On Thursday, the city council will decide whether to sell the land in Park Quadrant to Leeds based developer Expresso Property.It wants to build 111 flats in the internationally renowned conservation area near the city centre.A plan in 2007 for a &pound;15m housing development of 106 flats and six houses on the same site infuriated local residents.It fell through because of the international financial crisis but the city council put the site back up for sale in October last year.A report to councillors says: &quot;The site forms the final missing piece of famous 19th century Scottish architect Charles Wilson's vision for the Park Quadrant classical townscape.&quot;A total of 11 bids were received for the site which was narrowed down to four with each developer asked to provide a con temporary interpretation of the original architect's design.The preferred scheme is for 111 flats over five storeys with a penthouses on the sixth floor.A 107 space car park will be concealed under a landscape deck which provides amenity space for residents.If the scheme gets the go-ahead there will be 12 one bed flats, 73 two bed flats and 26 three bed.Liz Cameron, the city council's jobs and the economy spokeswoman, said: &quot;The disposal of this site will allow both the completion of an architectural masterpiece in Glasgow and the receipt of a considerable sum for the public purse.&quot;This would be a hugely exciting development of the highest design quality that would form the final missing piece in the jigsaw of one of the most celebrated townscapes in the city.&quot;Stephen Hampshire of Expresso Property Limited said: &quot;We would be honoured to be selected to restore the missing piece of Park Quadrant, one of the most prestigious addresses in Glasgow.&quot;The involvement of our team, which also includes the award-winning Glasgow architects Holmes Miller and Savills Scotland, ensures our proposed design achieves a sensitive balance between old and new and will meet current demand for beautifully designed residential property in the best locations in Scotland.&quot;We are committed to bringing beautiful bespoke projects to life. We have been inspired by the 'can-do' approach at large in Scotland, including Glasgow City Council which has ambitious plans to drive economic growth in the city.&quot;Local Labour councillor Philip Braat said he welcomed the fact the Park Quadrant site would eventually be completed as originally planned.But he added: &quot;I hope the development takes into consideration the views of the local community as well as ensuring it is in keeping with the existing heritage which in my view is absolutely crucial.&quot;

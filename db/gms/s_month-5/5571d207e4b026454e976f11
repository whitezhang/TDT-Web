A young mum was found dead in a garden just yards from her home after collapsing yesterday morning.
Police said they are not treating the death of 32-year-old Laura McArdle as suspicious.
A neighbour found her at around 10.30am.
She collapsed two doors away from the home she shared with her husband Phil, 40, and her 13-year-old son in Craigneuk in Wishaw, Lanarkshire.
Neighbour Andrew Gibb, 52, spoke of his shock after his son found Laura, who worked as a carer, slumped in the hedge of the garden next to his.
He said: “My son and his girlfriend Emma went outside to be picked up for work and saw Laura just lying there.
“She had been sick and we realised something was badly wrong. He came and got me but we couldn’t move her into the house.
“Her eyes started rolling in her head and my son’s girlfriend called an ambulance.
“We stayed with her until it came and the paramedics started working on her but then they told us she had gone. She was still in her pyjamas.
“There was a cigarette next to her when we found her.
“She was two doors down from her own house. She also had a handbag with her.
“Emma went to her door to tell her husband Phil but he was at work and her son answered. She told him there was an ambulance there for his mum.
“He asked how she was and she had to tell him that she’d gone, which was terrible. Phil came back from his work and I just told him I was so sorry for his loss. It’s such a shock.”
Phil said: “We don’t know what happened and will have to wait for the results of the post mortem.”

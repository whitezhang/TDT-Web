A CLOSING date has been set for developers to submit offers for Glasgow's historic Jordanhill Campus.Developers interested have until Wednesday May 27 to table bids for the 31-acre site which supports the development of around 364 new homes.The campus - located in the city's West End - is being brought to the market by JLL on behalf of the University of Strathclyde.Nina Stobie, associate director, JLL, said: &quot;With its enormous potential it is no surprise we've seen such strong interest in Jordanhill from a range of parties.&quot;The campus sits in a prime location in Glasgow's West End and we'd expect to see further significant activity over the next few weeks.&quot;Situated within the campus is the Category B-listed David Stow Building, a three-storey building which could be converted into high quality residential apartments.Two more buildings - Graham House and Douglas House - also offer scope for retention. The remainder of the site is occupied by 1960s buildings, hard standing and landscaping, with the recommendation that they be demolished to allow for new build residential.The location benefits from easy access to Great Western Road, the Clydeside Expressway, Clyde Tunnel and the M8 motorway while three train stations - Jordanhill, Anniesland and Scotstounhill - are close by.There are a wide variety of amenities in the local area, including supermarkets, shops, bars and restaurants.The site benefits from a Minded to Grant Planning Permission in Principle for residential development, while the University has worked closely with both Historic Scotland and Glasgow City Council on the project.

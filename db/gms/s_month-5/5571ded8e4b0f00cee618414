 A HIGHLAND businessman was one of the victims of a tragic plane crash in Perthshire yesterday afternoon. 
Dingwall garage owner John MacKinnon was flying with co-pilot and friend Andy Thompson when their twin-engine Cessna 172 came down in trees on a hillside near the village of Abernyte.
 Married father-of-four John - and Andy, from Glasgow - had been expected to land at Dundee Airport but air traffic controllers lost contact with them four miles out. 
Air accidents investigators have now started the hunt for clues to determine the cause of the tragedy which happened in in poor weather conditions, including low cloud, rain and wind.
 The light aircraft mysteriously vanished from the radar shortly after midday and a major search was launched in the Carse of Gowrie area. 
The wreckage of the plane was later discovered between Kinnaird and Abernyte.
Highland councillor for Dingwall Margaret Paterson, who knew John, said: “It’s an absolute tragedy.
“I am still getting over the shock of it because I only found out today.
“You couldn’t meet a nicer person and it’s just a tragedy - my heart goes out to all his family.
“As the local councillor, I know the family. He’s a long-established businessman in Dingwall and highly thought of.&quot;

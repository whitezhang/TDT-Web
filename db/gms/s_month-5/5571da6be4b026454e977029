Pals of Private Shaun Cole have organised a fundraiser in Edinburgh next month to raise funds for the family’s chosen charities following his tragic death .
The 22-year-old was on holiday in Miami, Florida with friends when he fell victim to an alleged hit and run before being found lying dead in a puddle of blood.
The investigation into his death by American police continues but his family and friends hope some good may come from his death by carrying out charity work.
Best friend Jamie Lothian, who attended the Miami Ultra music festival with Shaun in March, thanked Celtic star Griffiths for his donation.
The 26-year-old wrote on social media: “Would like to thank my childhood friend and now Celtic hero Leigh Griffiths for donating this signed hoops top for Shaun Cole’s fundraiser.”
 

The shirt will be auctioned off during the fundraiser on June 13 at the Edinburgh Corn Exchange.
All proceeds from the auction, raffle and ticket sales will go to good causes including veteran charity Erskine Hospital who support former soldiers and their families.
Kindhearted Griffiths, 24, has previously stepped in to help those in need, offering to save Christmas for a five-year-old whose presents money was nicked.
The Hibs-daft striker was hailed a hero after offering to buy video games for young Shane Wright after hearing his family home had been robbed.
The youngster’s dad, Michael, turned down the offer but was humbled by Griffith’s offer particularly as his family are huge fans of rival team Hearts .

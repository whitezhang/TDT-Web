 Josh Law thinks it is &quot;win or bust&quot; for Motherwell against Kilmarnock as he tries to avoid a possible play-off showdown with his brother at Rangers. 
 The midfielder's side are six points behind Ross County and Friday's visitors with three games remaining. 
 &quot;It could be an awkward one,&quot; he said of possibly facing brother Nicky. 
 &quot;But we're both hoping it won't come to that position and, if we do our job, it won't come to that. We need to get the win to give ourselves a chance.&quot; 
 Well sit second bottom of the Scottish Premiership table, which makes them favourites to face either Hibernian, Queen of the South or Rangers in the Premiership play-off final. 
 But Law insists there is a positive mood in his squad is positive despite failing to reduce the arrears on County when the Dingwall side visited Fir Park at the weekend.  
 &quot;Obviously last week we wanted more than a draw, but it's a point on the board that keeps us within distance of Kilmarnock and Ross County,&quot; he said. 
 &quot;It makes tomorrow absolutely massive for us. You have to say it is win or bust really. 
 &quot;With three games left and six points off, we've got to win tomorrow to bring to within three and that will make Kilmarnock or Ross County very nervous. 
 &quot;There's always going to be tension there because of the position we're in, but there's also that confidence that we can still do this and a determination to do it more than anything. 
 Law wants to avoid suffering relegation in his first season with Motherwell. 
 &quot;In a position like this, you've got to have broad shoulders, stick together and come through it,&quot; he said. 
 &quot;Kilmarnock are on a bad run, but we need the win more obviously than them and they would be quite happy with a draw I would have thought. 
 &quot;We need to go into the this game and win it and put the pressure on them even more.&quot;

OFFICERS from Police Scotland were at Clydebank shopping centre to raise awareness about the dangers of counterfeit goods and illicit trade.This was part of a national Safer Communities Campaign.The police were joined by partners including Federation Against Copy Right Theft (FACT), Trading Standards, Anti-Counterfeit Group (ACG).Many of the good sold on the streets for a cheaper price are not legit from makeup containing rat poison to alcohol substituted with anti-freeze.Police Scotland hoped to get across that the harmful ingredients included in these fake products should not be underestimated.The bargains are said to be not worth the risk as many products could potentially put a life in danger.It is known that the people selling these goods are often involved in other forms of serious and organised crime, using the cash to fund other crimes such as drug dealing, human trafficking and money laundering.Previously, Glasgow cops seized more than &pound;2million of suspected counterfeit goods in a massive crackdown on serious and organised crime groups.For years, counterfeiters and illicit traders have been flooding the market with fake designer clothes, trainers, CDs, DVDS, designer watches and jewellery.

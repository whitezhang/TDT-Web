TOMMY GILMOUR insists Scotland could be about to have its first world class heavyweight champion on its hands as Gary Cornish gets a crack at international honours this weekend.
The Glasgow fight promoter has teamed up with Kellie Maloney for the bout which brings the Highlander face to face with Hungarian Zoltan Csala for an IBO intercontinental championship at Bellahouston Leisure Centre on May 23.
Gilmour admits Cornish will need to step up to a challenge which will be a real acid test for his ambitions to shine at this level after impressing as an amateur.
He said: “Gary only had nine amateur fights, so his professional career so far has been a steady progress of education and learning his trade.
“He’s passed every test put in front of him with honours so to see leading companies such as William Hill, Electrical Engineers Arthur McKay and Southwark Metals getting involved as sponsors shows it’s now time to step up in class and see if he has what it takes to step up to the next level.
“There are plenty of journeymen out there but Csala is the right fight for him as he has ambitions of his own and has only lost one fight.
“He’s also boxed at a high level and this is reflected in his world ranking which is more than 50 places above Gary.
“But Gary’s looking forward to the fight because he knows these are the obstacles he has to overcome if he’s to fulfil his ambition of becoming Scotland’s first ever major heavyweight champion.”

Police investigating a Glasgow shooting have said they believe people with vital information have not come forward yet because it was a &quot;targeted attack&quot;.
A 29-year-old man was shot on Royston Road at about 18:30 on 7 May. 
He is still in hospital in a serious but stable condition. Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
The victim was &quot;deliberately&quot; struck by a white Mitsubishi 4x4 after getting out of his Audi car.
A man then got out of the car and shot him while he was on the ground.
The Mitsubishi made off at speed from the area, being driven &quot;erratically&quot;, and was recovered in Langmuirhead Road, Robroyston, a short time later. It had previously been reported missing from the Coatbridge area.
Det Insp Ogilvie Ross, from Greater Glasgow CID, said: &quot;We believe this was a targeted attack and as a result people with information may be reluctant to contact to police. 
&quot;I am sure there are people out there with vital information on this crime, who have yet to come forward to police. I would like to assure them that any information provided will be treated in confidence.&quot;
He added that callers do not have to give their names.

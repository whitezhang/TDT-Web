As voting closed in the General Election an exit poll has predicted Nicola Sturgeon's SNP could win all but one of the seats in Scotland.The poll suggested the Conservatives would be the largest party at Westminster, winning 316 seats - 10 short of the number needed for an overall majority.The Labour Party, which is expected to suffer heavy losses north of the border, is on course to have 239 seats across the UK, with the Liberal Democrats also seeing their numbers reduced, according to the study.The poll by GfK, NOP and Ipsos MORI on behalf of the BBC, ITV News, and Sky News, forecast that 58 of the 59 constituencies in Scotland would go to the SNP - who won just six seats in the last general election.A total of 22,000 people in 141 polling locations in 133 constituencies throughout Great Britain were interviewed for the research.Ms Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, has spent the election campaign arguing that a large block of SNP MPs could lock the Conservatives out of power at Westminster and help bring an end to austerity.Reacting to the figures, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, said she would be delighted if her party did increase its share of the seats across the country.But she insisted exit polls should always come with a &quot;health warning&quot;.&quot;I remember 1992,&quot; she told BBC Scotland.&quot;Exit polls can get it pretty badly wrong. I'm going to wait until 3am or 4am before I start making predictions.&quot;Kezia Dugdale, deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party, said she hoped the poll was &quot;badly, badly wrong&quot; because Scotland could not afford another five years of the Tories.Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, told the broadcaster: &quot;This is underplaying our potential.&quot;We very much target our focus on certain constituencies.&quot;The SNP also advised the exit poll result be treated with caution.Ms Sturgeon tweeted: &quot;I'd treat the exit poll with HUGE caution. I'm hoping for a good night but I think 58 seats is unlikely! &quot;Derek Mackay, transport minister and SNP business convenor, told the BBC: &quot;Talk about managing expectations...&quot;I think the SNP is probably going to have quite a good night. But 58 feels somewhat high on the optimistic side.&quot;

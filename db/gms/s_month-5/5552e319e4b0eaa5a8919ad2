PRIMARY school children have spent a day in the life of a photographer at a special preview of this year's Festival of Museums events.Three Knightswood Primary pupils dressed up as different creatures from the sky, sea and land and paraded around in front of an animal habitat scene, while their classmates posed as the paparazzi - and were determined to get the best shot.The youngsters, who visited the Scotland Street School Museum yesterday, then moved onto sunglight photography, creating negative images on special paper with random objects.The photography themed activities are just one of the many different attractions that will take place across Glasgow's museums this Saturday.As part of the festival, the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA), Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, the Riverside Museum and the Burrell Collection will all participate in the action-packed activity tour.Guests will be treated to an array of fun and free activities throughout Glasgow and will also be able to hop on board a vintage bus, which has been carefully restored by Glasgow Vintage Vehicle Trust, to be transported to the other museums.Kelvingrove will offer families the chance to take part in underwater archaeology alongside the Scottish Crannog Centre and youngsters will be able to make a special pendant made from bone, wood or leather to take home at GoMA.While parents and children alike will be taken back in time to discover the jobs of their grandparents and meet with famous past figures at the Riverside.Chair of Glasgow Life, Councillor Archie Graham, said there is no better time to view each museum's displays.He said: &quot;This weekend they will also be chock full of free, exciting events and activities aimed at all the family.&quot;Whether you are a regular museum goer or are planning your first visit this weekend is the perfect time to go.&quot;And what better way to get around the different museums in Glasgow than by hopping on board the beautifully restored vintage bus for a trip down memory lane.&quot;The weekend-long festival will take place from Friday May 15 to Sunday May 17 and has promised to include something for everyone with more than 100 events on offer across Scotland.Joanne Orr, chief executive of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: &quot;Festival of Museums is about igniting imaginations while celebrating Scotland's wealth of culture.&quot;There is a packed programme this year with lots of extraordinary, surprising and exciting events over three fun-filled days.&quot;So come and see what Scotland's museums and galleries have in store for you.&quot;Activities and the bus tour of Glasgow's museums will take place on Saturday May 16 between 11am and 4pm.The attractions and the bus ride for the day will not be available for pre-booking as both are offered on a first-come, first-served basis.For more information on the events and the bus timetable, go to www.glasgowmuseums.com.

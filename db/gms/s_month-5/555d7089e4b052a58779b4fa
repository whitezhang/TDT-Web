SMALL businesses fighting "historic" repair bills have been served notices of removal.Ladywell Crystals and Healing has been told to leave their High Street premises by next Wednesday, May 27 unless they agree a new lease with tenant City Property.The situation is made complicated because store owner Samantha Cooper is refusing to pay thousands of pounds for repairs which she believes are down to a lack of maintenance over the years before she took over in 2009.Nearby Glasgow Appliances has also been served a notice of removal.City Property were keen to stress they were not eviction letters, but were part of the &quot;lease renewal&quot; process.As the Evening Times reported in April, Ms Cooper has been caught up in a row with City Property - Glasgow City Council's arm's-length company - for five years over dry rot and damp, including an open sewer underneath the shop.Ms Cooper has sought legal advice and is being represented by Glasgow solicitor Austin Lafferty.Ms Cooper, 45, who also runs nearby store 23 Enigma, said: &quot;For the past five years it's had an accumulative effect of stress and worry.&quot;Every time we receive a City Property letter we're basically watching our business die.&quot;We've been given a notice of removal. It's going to destroy our business, we keep telling them this.&quot;Glasgow Appliances owner Gordon Jennens said: &quot;We have no idea why we received the notice of removal,&quot;When we got in touch with City Property they said it was because we hadn't kept up with our rent but my wife and I have all the receipts.&quot;Glasgow Central SNP MP Alison Thewliss said she would be meeting with City Property.She said: &quot;I will do all I can to support the businesses and challenge City Property.&quot;It's completely unfair that they are forcing businesses to pay huge bills for problems which should have been resolved long ago.&quot;A spokesman from City Property said they had started an engagement process with tenants in the High Street/Saltmarket area.He said: &quot;As standard practice in the lease renewal process, all tenants receive 'notice of removal' letters when their lease is coming to an end.&quot;The notice of removal is not an eviction notice, it is a communication between the landlord and tenant to bring the existing lease to an end, thus allowing the landlord and tenant the option to review the terms of the occupation.&quot;We are committed to actively listening to all of our tenants to improve our services and discuss any financial or repair issues they might be experiencing.&quot;Unfortunately neither of the tenants decided to take up this opportunity.&quot;

 THE popular live-action game 2.8 Hours Later has announced their 2015 dates for fresh meat to take part in the ‘original, biggest and most sensational urban zombie chase game’. 
This year’s event ’Ruin’ will now be set five years after the original outbreak and humanity will be teetering on the edge of extinction.
Infection rates dwarf birth rates and the fight for survival is as bad among humans as it is between the living and the walking dead.
Players will need to scour the city looking for mysterious vials and uncover clues about the scientists behind the original infection and the truth behind their experiments.
As a runner, you’ll be one of the final few survivors and your only task is to make it through the night.
 

The game, developed by award-winning game designers, Slingshot, is now in its sixth year, with over 60,000 people having already taken part in 2.8 Hours Later to date. This year alone there were over 18,000 participants, 5,000 of which played in the London games over Halloween.
Simon Evans co-founded 2.8 Hours Later with his business partner Simon Johnson.
 He said: “We visited Glasgow last year and as the game continues to grow in popularity we thought we’d bring it back to the city for an even more spectacular event. 
“People are always looking for something that will drag them out of their comfort zone and ‘Ruin’ will do just that.”
“In 2015 the game will offer a whole host of new challenges for our players to contend with and characters they’ll meet which will make the experience completely different to previous years.
 

“The mission is new, the story is fresh, the gameplay is unlike anything that has come before in 2.8 Hours Later.”
He added: “This offers a unique chance for players to act the lead role in a zombie video game or horror movie. People tend to sign up as a team, but you can sign up individually. Our only restriction is you have to be over 18 to play.”

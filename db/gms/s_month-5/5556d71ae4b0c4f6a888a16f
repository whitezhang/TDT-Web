CHILDREN with autism are being place in mainstream schools when it is unsuitable for their needs according to a Glasgow MSP.John Mason SNP MSP for Shettleston said Glasgow City Council is placing pupils in schools when they should be in specialist units.The council said the needs of the child is always put first and all cases are monitored and reviewed with decisions taken after family wishes and expert advice is considered.Mr Mason asked the Schools Minister, Alistair Allan, about placing of pupils in the city in the Scottish Parliament.Dr Allan said the law placed a duty on councils to place pupils in mainstream school unless specific exceptions applied, including if it was not suitable for the child, would cause disruption to others or was too expensive.Mr Mason said some of his constituents were concerned that the exceptions were being met but pupils were still placed in mainstream schools.Mr Mason said he was reflecting the concerns of a group of parents and carers for children with autismHe said: &quot;It is clear that not all families with autistic children in Glasgow are getting the educational support that they require. A number of people have brought cases to me in which their children with special educational needs are not adequately catered to.&quot;He said children with special requirements might be put into a class alongside children with no such requirements which he said can lead to a&quot; multitude of issues&quot; for the children, their teachers and their families.He added:&quot;I therefore believe that more must be done to reform to the way in which Glaswegian children with autism are allocated schools.&quot;A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said: &quot;We monitor and review cases on a regular basis.&quot;Most children who are placed in a mainstream setting with support flourish, but if they don't we work with the family and take advice from the specialists. We always respond to the needs of the child.&quot;

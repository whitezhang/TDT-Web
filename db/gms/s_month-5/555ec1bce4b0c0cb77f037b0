SCOTLAND's first dedicated fundraising website for parks and green-spaces will be launched this weekend in Glasgow.Charity MyParkScotland hopes to raise thousands of pounds through the crowd-funding tool to help improve parks throughout Glasgow and Edinburgh.The site will also allow users to search for their nearest park and find local events and activities.Ian Goodman, MyParkScotland Project Manager, will be cycling round 42 parks - starting from Glasgow's highest park at Cathkin Braes to mark the launch.He said: &quot;Park users often told us they would like to be able to support their local park but there wasn't an easy way to do this.&quot;That's why we developed MyParkScotland as a safe and easy way for people to donate to support park improvement projects developed by Friends of Parks and other local groups, and to make donations to parks.&quot;Hayburn Play Park in Hyndland will be first to take advantage of the new site as it aims to raise &pound;550 for a mini orchard as part of a natural play area it is developing.Events over the spring bank holiday weekend will help launch the website, including a free tai-chi session at the Botanic Gardens tomorrow at 2pm and a walking tour of The Necropolis on Sunday.The charity also hopes that funds raised through gift aid will go into protecting the future of parks throughout Scotland.Mr Goodman said: &quot;We are using this extra funding to build sustainability and endowment funds for Scotland's parks - helping to safeguard these national treasures for future generations.&quot;The charity, which hopes to roll out the project across the country after initially focussing on 254 sites in Glasgow and Edinburgh, believes that green spaces are important in people's lives.Julie Procter, Chief Executive of Greenspace Scotland, which helped in the development of the scheme, said: &quot;Parks make a big difference to all of our lives.&quot;Greenspace is nature's anti-depressant - research shows just viewing a greenspace for 3 to 5 minutes can significantly reduce stress.&quot;When we're not relaxing in our parks, they can help us get fit and active.&quot;What better place for children to run around and play.&quot;The project has also received the council's backing.Councillor Alistair Watson, Executive Member for Sustainability and Transport at Glasgow City Council, said: &quot;MyParkScotland is an exciting new fundraising initiative which will help people not only discover their local parks but also help support them.&quot;MyParkScotland has the potential to give Friends of groups the tool to generate funds for park projects, events and activities - and that is to be welcomed.&quot;

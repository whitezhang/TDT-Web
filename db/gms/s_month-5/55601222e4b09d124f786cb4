A TOP cop today warned lives are at risk if a controversial city nightclub was to remain open.Licensing chiefs dealt The Arches arts and entertainment complex a blow when they removed its late license, forcing the club to close at midnight, effectively shutting it down.And directors at the closure threatened nightclub confirmed they are considering a legal appeal against the recent decision to curtail its hours.But Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland, who is in charge of policing the city centre, said: &quot;As the area commander for Glasgow city centre, I want to see a vibrant city that welcomes and supports artistic talent.&quot;But this can absolutely not be at a cost to public safety, particularly young people who may be risking their lives week after week.&quot;It is my firm view that the frequency and volume of incidents that were occurring at the Arches nightclub would have resulted in fatal consequences had we not acted.&quot;Since The Arches lost its late licence there have been fears over the viability rest of the venue which includes theatre, exhibition space, cafe and bars as the profits from the club helps fund the other activities.Glasgow licensing board ruled earlier this month the club had to close at midnight following police complaints of drug misuse and disorder.It was the third time the police had recommended action against the venue.Since then, around 37,000 people have signed a petition calling for the reinstatement of the popular club's licence.Mr Sutherland said: &quot;I would like to re-emphasise that Police Scotland has acted to protect and ensure public safety by submitting a review to the Glasgow Licensing Board in respect of the Arches venue.&quot;Whilst the Licensing Board has delivered its decision, the matter may be subject to an appeal.&quot;I am therefore constrained by the level of information that I can provide and that supported our review submission to the board.&quot;In general terms, I would emphasise that all licensed premises have a duty to report any incidents of criminality that occur on their premises to the police.&quot;This is exactly what I expect and what I believe we receive from our pubs and clubs across the city.&quot;I would like to reassure those in the licensed trade that we remain committed to supporting and working with responsible Licence Holders and Designated Premises Managers across Glasgow and Scotland to ensure alcohol is enjoyed responsibly and within a safe environment.&quot;It comes as a group of Glasgow's newest MPs have written to the council, raising concerns over the future of the Arches.Five of the city's seven SNP MPs elected this month asked the council if it would work with the Arches to assist it to carry on given the loss of revenue it will suffer from the closure of the late night club.Patrick Grady, Stewart Mc-Donald, Natalie McGarry, Chris Stephens and Anne McLaughlin wrote to Glasgow City Council chief executive, Annemarie O'Donnell, about the decision.In the letter the MPs state: &quot;We share the concerns of our constituents that removal of the late license will have an impact on the overall income stream for the venue and may limit its ability to operate as a daytime venue.&quot;

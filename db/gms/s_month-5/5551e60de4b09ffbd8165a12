POLICE have stepped up patrols and their presence on the streets in an area where a man was shot and run over in an apparent gangland hit.Detectives have appealed for witnesses after Mark Bristow, 29, was blasted in the legs as he lay on the ground after being hit by a Mitsubishi 4x4 in Glasgow's Royston Road last week.There has been speculation that Mr Bristow was attacked as part of a gangland feud between two families which has been simmering in the background of the area.However, police said that putting on additional patrols was &quot;normal&quot; after such an incident, and the move was not connected to fears of reprisals.Mr Bristow remains in a serious condition in hospital following the attack at 6.30pm last Thursday.Police are treating the incident as attempted murder, and have been checking CCTV for evidence and carrying out door to door inquiries.The victim was stepping out of his Audi when he was deliberately run over by the 4x4, police said.The attackers then turned the car around before shooting him. The vehicle was later found dumped in the Robroyston area.Detectives do not think the attack was random and believe Mr Bristow was targeted by the gunman.One source said: &quot;A group of people were after the victim and they managed to get to him. There has been an ongoing feud which has been getting worse in the last few weeks.&quot;There was no way a member of the public was going to get caught up in this. The people involved are well-known locally.&quot;A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: &quot;We have increased our presence on the streets, as is normal after an incident like this. Our inquiries are ongoing.&quot;

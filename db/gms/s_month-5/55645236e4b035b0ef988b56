A MAN has given his fiance the gift of life by donating one of his kidneys to her.
Gordon Nicoll, 33, made the heartfelt offer to Stephanie Nash when they were told she needed a transplant.
 Despite protesting initially, Stephanie – who suffered from a kidney deficiency called nephrotic syndrome – eventually agreed and went ahead with the operation four months ago. 
Stephanie, 32, is originally from Newton Mearns near Glasgow but now lives in London where she works as a sales manager in the same company as Gordon.
She said: “When I was first told I needed a transplant I was in shock. Before I had time to process anything, Gordon was giving over his details to be tested to see if he would be a suitable donor. When we later found out he was a match, it was like we were meant to be all along.
“It was fantastic, but I had reservations. I was worried about him doing it.
“It seems a bit surreal. We’re both back at work now and doing really well.”
 

Stephanie was on daily medication for her condition, which she has had since the age of 13, but never thought she would need a transplant.
Now the pair want to encourage others to join the organ donation register.
Gordon said: “It’s an amazing experience and you’re giving the gift of life. I’d recommend that more people sign up to be living donors.
“When Stephanie woke up from the surgery she felt great straight away.”

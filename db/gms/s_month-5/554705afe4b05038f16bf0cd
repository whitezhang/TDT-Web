AS a firefighter working in Scotland's biggest city, Martin Barker spent 15 years battling to save lives.But when he needed emergency help himself, that help was not forthcoming.Martin spent two hours lying on the ground desperately trying to alert passers by after he collapsed on a street in Hamilton on his way to work. However, no-one stopped to come to his aid.With great determination, Martin managed to crawl to the doorway of a house and the owner called an ambulance.The 48-year-old suffers from Ataxia, a neurological condition affecting less than 2% of the UK population which affects mobility, coordination and speech, causing sufferers to slur their words.He knows it is probable that those people who walked past him, mistakenly believed he was drunk.&quot;It was once described to me as 'being drunk without the happiness'.&quot; he says and recalls another incident that happened in a well-known electrical store.Martin, who is from Shawlands, said: &quot;A sales assistant asked if I had been drinking. I explained my condition and why I might appear like this.&quot;A few weeks later, I got questioned again by the same assistant. I do not blame people their first impressions, but, I was annoyed that it happened for a second time with the same person.&quot;The store apologised but Martin can reel off countless other examples including being questioned by police.&quot;I now have a walking stick to advertise the fact I have mobility problems and to prevent any prejudice I may encounter&quot;, he says.Ataxia is progressive and there is no treatment or cure. Anyone of any age can get it but certain types are more common in certain age groups.Estimates from recent studies say there are at least 10,000 adults and about 500 children in the UK with a progressive Ataxia.It can be the result of underlying conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis and can also occur due to head trauma.Martin was diagnosed with the hereditary form of the condition in 2001 in his mid-30s, a year after his sister Karen, 49, who lives in Auldhouse, South Lanarkshire - leaving two families blighted.Martin and wife Jackie, know that their two sons Michael, 21, and Ewan, 17, have a 50% chance of developing the condition as will Karen's children, Jordan, 23 and Jenna, 21. They are all facing the ordeal of tests at some point in the future.Jackie, 50, who works as a medical secretary for Ross Hall Hospital, said: &quot;They have decided not to do it at the moment and have just been advised to keep as fit as possible and continue with their studies.&quot;It is a living hell. Whilst you are worrying about your husband, you are also worrying about your children.&quot;You just have to take what life throws at you and get on with it.&quot;The condition cost Martin his job on the frontline of the then Strathclyde Fire and Rescue, where he was based at Glasgow's Polmadie fire station but he continues to work in HR and has praised the service for their support, which includes regular physiotherapy sessions. He also praised a government scheme, which provides taxis to work for people affected by disability or illness.One of the hardest aspects of Ataxia, he says, was losing the ability to be fully active. As well as the extreme physicality of his job in the fire brigade, he cycled to work every day and enjoyed playing five-a-side football with his colleagues.It is perhaps part of the reason why he is relishing to chance to take part in a charity challenge that would give most people sleepless nights. On August 22, he will jump out of a plane cruising at 10,000ft in the Lake District to raise money for the charity, Ataxia UK, which offers support to patients and raises vital funds for research into the condition. Son, Michael, 21, who is currently studying in Barcelona, is also taking part, while mum Jackie and brother Ewan watch anxiously from the ground.Martin said: &quot;It's about raising awareness and saying to the public, don't jump to conclusions.&quot;To sponsor Martin or Michael go to http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/barkerchallenge2015

Glasgow-based retailer Watt Brothers has announced plans to create up to 350 new jobs opening six new stores.
The family-owned company, currently celebrating its centenary year, said it plans to open new outlets at Port Glasgow and Irvine, with further sites currently being considered.
Watt Brothers, which operates a department store style offering, said existing outlets in Clarkston, Ayr and Livingston are also to be expanded and new jobs will be created in at its headquarters and Govan warehouse and across eight existing stores.
The company said the expansion will take place over the coming years, though no specific timescale has been outlined.
Owner Willie Watt said: “Our business has changed dramatically since it first opened its doors in Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street, when the focus was exclusively on high-end ladies' fashions.
“We have evolved as a business and recognised that a retail offer including a wider range of great value products in a department store-style setting has greater appeal to today's consumer.
“We've seen positive growth in terms of both turnover and customer numbers, even in the recent recessionary period, and we've continued our expansion in terms of new store openings.
“My long-term plan is to have a total of 16 stores throughout Scotland, and we're constantly looking at new opportunities to secure ideal locations.”
Watt Brothers, which sells a wide range of retail goods, including clothing, homewares, toys and jewellery, currently employs around 500 staff.

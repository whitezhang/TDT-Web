@patersonHTTALKS have taken place to try and save the Arches as an arts venue.Licensing chiefs dealt the arts and entertainment complex a blow when they removed its late license, forcing the club to close at midnight, effectively shutting it down.Now officials from creative Scotland, Glasgow City Council and The Arches have met to try and ensure the daytime venue is not forced to close.The meeting comes as a group of Glasgow's newest MPs have written to the council, raising concerns over the future of the Arches.Since it lost its late license there have been fears over the viability rest of the venue which includes theatre, exhibition space, cafe and bars as the profits from the club helps fund the other activities.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said the talks are aimed at the three organisations working together to protect the non club part of the Arches.Glasgow licensing board ruled earlier this month the club had to close at midnight following police complaints of drug misuse and disorder.It was the third time the Police had recommended action against the venue.Five of the city's seven SNP MPs elected this month asked the council if it would work with the Arches to assist it to carry on given the loss of revenue it will suffer from the closure of the late night club.Patrick Grady, Stewart McDonald, Natalie McGarry, Chris Stephens and Anne McLaughlin wrote to Glasgow City Council chief executive, Annemarie O'Donnell, about the decision.In the letter the MPs state: &quot;We share the concerns of our constituents that removal of the late license will have an impact on the overall income stream for the venue and may limit its ability to operate as a daytime venue.&quot;Over the years, the Arches has become established as a focal point for creative arts in Glasgow, and is an asset to the wider city centre area.&quot;It would be helpful if you could outline what consideration the Council has given to these issues, and in particular whether it would be prepared to work with the venue to identify alternative funding streams or options that may allow it to continue to operate, with or without a reinstated late license.&quot;The club revenue accounts for half of the total turnover of the Arches and the overall business is thought to be at risk, without it.Patrick Grady, Glasgow North SNP MP, said people had contacted him and his Westminster colleagues concerned that the daytime venue could be forced to close.He said: &quot;I've heard from lots of constituents who value the space and the range of activities on offer day and night, and I share their concerns that withdrawal of the late licence puts the whole operation at risk.&quot;The Council needs to work closely with the management to look for solutions so that the Arches is not forced to close as a result of this decision.&quot;The Politicians have also asked about the possible routes for the licence holder to appeal the decision and how all venues in the city can take a zero tolerance approach to drug use.

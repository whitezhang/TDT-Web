AN INVESTIGATION is underway after a seriously ill woman in a wheelchair and young girl were refused entry to a Glasgow pub because they wore the Saltire flag.In two separate incidents on Saturday, mum-of-five Lindsay Jarrett, 43, and Carol Hogg were turned away from the Camperdown Place Wetherspoons, in Queen Street station.Lindsay, who was crowned Indy Woman of the Year in the first Margo awards earlier this month, and has oxygen tubes due to a lung capacity of 25%, was not allowed to use the pub's facilities.She posted online about the two &quot;very aggressive&quot; security guards, saying they refused to let her in because &quot;I had the audacity to wear a T shirt with a saltire in a country where the Saltire is my flag.&quot;Please boycott this pub in support.&quot;Within hours, others were repeating her post and photo on Twitter, with the #boycottwetherspoons hashtag.Some Tweeted directions to the Yes Bar, in Drury Street.Another woman, Carol Hogg, posted a photo of her young daughter who she said was also refused entry because she was wearing Carol's blue and white jacket tied around her waist.She said she would be making an official complaint.Earlier in the day, around 1000 people turned out in George Square for the Seize the Day rally organised by a pro-independence group linked to Tommy Sheridan.Lindsay, whose picture showed her with oxygen tubes feeding into her nose, was diagnosed with an incurable genetic condition - Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency - seven years ago.She was given her Margo award - named in honour of independent Lothian MSP Margo MacDonald - after she scaled the rockface at Edinburgh Castle with a tank of oxygen on her back to unfurl a Yes banner during the referendum.She needs a double lung and liver transplant without which she could have just months to live.Friends said the pub chain was treating Lindsay, who lives in the Highlands, &quot;like scum.&quot;The pub issued a statement saying they apologised &quot;whole heartedly for this regretful situation.&quot;Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon added: &quot;The two people should not have been refused entry and we have apologised for doing so.&quot;The door staff were instructed by a member of staff to refuse them entry. Put simply it should not have happened.&quot;This was a mistake, but without malice.&quot;Door staff and staff working in the pub itself have been reminded that Wetherspoon does not have a policy or an issue with customers wearing such T-shirts.&quot;

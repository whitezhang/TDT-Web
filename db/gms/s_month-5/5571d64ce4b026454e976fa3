SCOTTISH soldiers turned out in style to say farewell to a German town after 70 years.
Troops from the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Highlanders marched through Fallingbostel.
The British Army have been based in the area since the end of World War II when soldiers liberated the Stalag XIB prisoner of war camp.
 


German officials presented the departing units with the prestigious Federal Fahnenband, a ribbon of honour, in recognition of their service in and to Germany.
Colonel Andy Reynolds, commander of the Bergen-Hohne Garrison, said: “Following 70 years of tremendous support it is with deep regret that we leave Fallingbostel this summer.
 “What began in war is ending in peace and enduring friendship. We take this opportunity to celebrate those friendships and thank our German hosts who have supported us in our time here.” 
 


Many Scottish units – such as the Black Watch and the Royal Highland Fusiliers – were based in Fallingbostel or trained there to deploy to war zones.
During the war, Fallingbostel was the site of three POW camps. More than 30,000 Soviet prisoners are buried there.
The Bergen Belsen concentration camp was only 30 minutes away.
After the war, the Fallingbostel camp was used as an internment camp for Nazis.

HOMES faced disruption to water supplies today as a result of a faulty valve.Around 1300 properties Govan, Cardonald, Ibrox, Drumchapel, Mosspark, Paisley and Renfrew were affected from around 6.40am.Customers were hit when they lost their water supply, or suffered low pressure and discoloured water.Scottish Water said it was aware of the problem which was caused by a faulty valve in a water pipe.A Scottish Water statement read: &quot;We have had reports of loss of water supply, low pressure and discoloured water from the G13, G15, G41, G52, G53 and PA1 area.&quot;This is due to a fault on a valve.&quot;Engineers worked to resolve the problem as quickly and efficiently as possible and supplies were returned around an hour later.

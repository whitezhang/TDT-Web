THE Scottish SPCA is caring for an adorable pine marten found orphaned in the Highlands.
Scotland's animal welfare charity was alerted after the eight week old male kit was discovered at an industrial site in Nigg.
The pine marten is now being looked after at the charity's National Wildlife Rescue Centre in Fishcross, where he has been named Caillen.
Centre manager Colin Seddon said, &quot;Caillen is doing well and is already self-feeding.
&quot;We are hopeful he will be back in his natural habitat by the end of summer once he is fully developed and able to fend for himself.
&quot;Caillen will be released in an area of low pine marten density to strengthen the existing population and encourage growth.&quot;
Anyone who discovers an injured or distressed wild animal should call the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999.

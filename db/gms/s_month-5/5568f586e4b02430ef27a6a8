 Ross County have signed Scott Fox on a two-year contract after the 27-year-old goalkeeper rejected a new deal with Partick Thistle. 
 Fox has been at Firhill for five years since leaving Dundee, making 135 appearances for the Glasgow club. 
 He joins their Scottish Premiership rivals after playing 24 times this term. 
 County manager Jim McIntyre said: &quot;I'm delighted to add a goalkeeper of Scott's calibre to the squad.&quot; 
 Fox started his career as a youth with Celtic and spent time on loan to East Fife before moving to Queen of the South. 
 &quot;He's a player I've admired for a long time - very much a modern-day keeper,&quot; McIntyre told his club website. 
 &quot;He's good with the back pass, kicks the ball well and has a safe pair of hands.&quot; 
 Thistle finished eighth this season, one place and two points above County.

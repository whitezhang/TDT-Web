As part of this we have appointed national improvement officers who will liaise directly with the locally appointed teams to provide a coordinated, flexible and combined performance and improvement support.&quot;The Health Secretary met with nurses and doctors leaders and health board bosses from across the country to agree the plan.The Glasgow figures have shown improvement but still lag well behind the Scottish performance.Across all seven sits which includes the four city A&amp;E departments, at the Royal, Southern, Western and Victoria sites and the RAH in Paisley, Inverclyde Royal in Greenock and the Sick Kids at Yorkhill.Across the country the performance was 93.6% seen within four hours for Glasgow it was 89.6% but for the four Glasgow adult hospitals 86.7%.The western Infirmary has seen the biggest improvement from below 60% in February when weekly reporting started to 86% last week.The overall health board figures have gone form %76% to 89%.

POLICE are investigating a possible new sighting of a father-of-five who went missing on his way to work.&nbsp;The last reported sighting of John Murphy was in Duke Street early last Tuesday morning, but officers are checking claims he was seen near an East End park.The 52-year-old from Dennistoun is believed to have been seen by a member of the public near Alexandra Park at around noon the same day.It comes after the Evening Times revealed John was caught on CCTV entering a local shop at around 7am last Tuesday.Eight minutes later he emerged with a paper.John was last seen by his family at their home in Craigpark Drive before he went to bed last Monday evening.His desperate family have been putting up &quot;missing posters&quot; across the city and on dozens of bus shelters.Yesterday, a week on, his son, also John, retraced his dad's last known movements in the hope of jogging someone's memory and finding new clues in the hunt.John, 24, said: &quot;My dad was seen spotted near Alexandra Park, at the gates, at around noon.&quot;Being there at that time isn't part of his usual routine, but it is near my brother's school.&quot;We're still trying to find out if he got on a bus at Duke Street after he left the shop and picked up his paper.&quot;He was last seen walking towards the bus stop, but what we don't know is what happened next.&quot;John Snr is believed to have left his home early on Tuesday morning and was thought to be heading to Easthall Park Housing Co-operative, in Easterhouse.However, he never arrived at work and his family raised the alarm on Tuesday evening when he failed to return home.When he left his home on Tuesday morning, he is believed to have been wearing a beige T-shirt, embroidered with Easthall Park's logo, a black jacket, black cargo trousers and black boots.John is now planning on organising another search for his missing dad in the Cranhill and Carntyne areas.John Snr's distraught family have repeatedly urged him to come home &quot;where he belongs&quot;.Anybody with information should contact police on 101.

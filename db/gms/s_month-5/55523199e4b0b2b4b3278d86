WHILE many Scots were still fast asleep, cycling star Danny MacAskill hit the streets of Glasgow to perform some of his heart stopping stunts early on Tuesday morning.
Armed with a GoPro camera on his helmet, the 29-year-old cycles through a deserted Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street after setting off from an unknown location at 5.30am. 
Stopping at the Royal Concert Hall to make an eye-watering descent from the famous steps, MacAskill then clears the rail at Buchannan Galleries and pulls off a series of twists and jumps as he makes his way down the street.
Encountering some fellow cyclists in the west end's University Avenue, the trial cyclist makes one more jump before making his way back to base just over an hour later. 
The footage which was uploaded just hours later has been so far viewed over 67, 240 times. 
 

Posting the clip on his Facebook page, Danny said: &quot;Went out for a wee sesh this morning on the hight street before the shops opened. Mount Creative behind the GoPro ‪#‎530am‬ ‪#‎Blowingahooly‬&quot;
 
In November 2014, Danny added another death-defying stunt to his record by completing a dangerous loop-the-loop challenge on a barge on the River Thames in London.

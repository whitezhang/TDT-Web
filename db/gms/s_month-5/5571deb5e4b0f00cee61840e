ANDY Murray faced a new dilemma as he tried to win his first clay court title: to wear or not to wear his wedding ring?
In the end he opted to tie the knot again – by attaching the platinum band to one of his trainers.
Andy was playing in his first tournament since marrying long-term girlfriend Kim Sears last month. And he took just over three hours to defeat Germany’s Philipp Kohlschreiber 7-6, 5-7, 7-6.

The Scot seems set to follow the example of tennis legend Roger Federer, who doesn’t wear a ring for fear it will affect his play.
Andy did put the ring back on his finger before being presented with the BMW Open title in Munich.
 

His win yesterday was the first British male success in a main tour clay court event since Buster Mottram triumphed in Palma, Majorca, in 1976.
The world No3 also proved he was a real crowd pleaser by donning a pair of traditional lederhosen before being handed the keys to a new BMW i8.

Afterwards Murray said: “I didn’t realise I was the first Brit to win on clay for so long, so that’s obviously an honour.”

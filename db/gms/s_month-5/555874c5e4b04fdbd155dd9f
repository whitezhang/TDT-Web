A 23-year-old man has been arrested and will appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court tomorrow in connection with the murder of a 29 year-old man in Partick, Glasgow yesterday.
The victim had been with friends and family members in the flat above the popular Dolphin bar in when violence flared just before 9am yesterday.
Neighbours said they saw a blood-soaked man flee from the property in Benalder Street.
Dolphin owner Stephen McBride told the Sunday Mail: “It’s been a terrible incident. I’ve been here five years and never have I heard any trouble from upstairs.
“I’ve been here since 9.40am this morning and I saw the ambulances. Police told me there had been an incident and I wasn’t allowed in my premises.
“After that, I told them about the CCTV outside the bar which I’ve now been informed is helping them with their enquiries.”

The Mail understands the dead man had been visiting a family member at the flat with his brother, but police were unable to confirm that.
Another man and a woman were also injured during the incident and were taken to the Western Infirmary, where the man was released after checks.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said last night: “At around 8.50am on Saturday, police were called to a report of a disturbance in a flat in Benalder Street, Partick.
“On arrival officers found a man seriously injured. He was treated by paramedics, however, he died at the scene.
“A post mortem will take place in due course to establish the exact cause of his death but at this time it is being treated it a suspicious.
“A 25 year-old woman was also injured during this incident. Both attended at the Western Infirmary where the woman has been detained for observations.”

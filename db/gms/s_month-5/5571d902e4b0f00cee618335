The son and daughter-in-law of the oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood have donated &pound;250,000 towards medical equipment at Wishaw General Hospital.
Garreth Wood and his wife, former Miss Scotland Nicola Wood, made the offer after losing triplets, born prematurely at the hospital in 2013.
They hope the equipment will help save the lives of other premature babies.
Last week Sir Ian Wood announced he was donating &pound;10m for a new car park at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

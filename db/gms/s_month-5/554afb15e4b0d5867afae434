SANCTUARY Housing Association has come under fire from another tenant who claims she has waited weeks for work on a new kitchen to be completed.Last week the Evening Times stepped in when veteran David McClymont was left without washing or cooking facilities during an upgrade to properties in Pollok.His flat is one of 21 undergoing a refit by a sub-contractor who wrote to tenants last to apologise for delays.A letter from site manager Phil Dickov, seen by the Evening Times, said: &quot;The works that are taking place was originally expected to take ten days to complete. We would like to apologise as this is now taking 15 working days to complete.&quot;But one tenant who contacted the Evening Times after reading about neighbour David McClymont's plight insists she has been waiting five weeks for tradesmen to finish redoing her kitchen.Elaine Donaghy, 57, who lives in Towerside Road with her 17-year-old son said: &quot;I'm getting a new kitchen fitted and I thought it would be seven to ten days but I've been waiting 35 days for them to finish everything.&quot;They came in and made me sign all these forms and they started on April 1. It's been a catastrophe ever since.&quot;I have COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and they've been drilling and plastering for days and the dust has been going everywhere.&quot;There were times when I couldn't breathe. I was up night after night. They're also using chemicals which I'm breathing in.&quot;The doors are wide open while the tradesmen go in and out and I was four days without hot water and gas central heating, which has also affected my health.&quot;It's been a nightmare. I'm so angry about it all.&quot;Sanctuary is replacing kitchens and bathrooms at 21 properties in Pollok and dozens of residents are believed to have been affected by delays.Last week Ms Donaghy's neighbour David McClymont, 52, who suffers from PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) after serving in the army for eleven years, spoke about his health problems which he claimed had worsened during the refit.He said: &quot;Most of the time I'm stuck in the house and the doctor had to increase my medication this week because I'm not getting any sleep with of all this hassle with the house.&quot;They were meant to do my kitchen and bathroom in two weeks and this is the third week.&quot;Work at Mr McClymont's house was completed on Monday, after the Evening Times contacted Sanctuary.Mr McClymont said: &quot;They sent lots of workers to finish it in the last few days.&quot;But many more residents like Ms Donaghy are still waiting and work on a new kitchen floor was ongoing when the Evening Times visited her flat on Monday.A spokesman for Sanctuary said: &quot;Ms Donaghy's brand new kitchen is complete and has been fully functional for almost a fortnight.&quot;The principal contractor has already apologised to her for the disruption of the refurbishment works overrunning, but this delay was only a few days beyond the programmed completion date.&quot;Some cosmetic snagging issues remain outstanding but none of these affect the use of her kitchen. We would expect these minor issues to be resolved in the coming days.&quot;

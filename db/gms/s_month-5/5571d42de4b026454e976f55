TV NEWSMAN Mike Edwards will carry a photo of his dad next to his heart as he watches Inverness Caledonian Thistle in Saturday’s Scottish Cup final.
STV’s senior reporter is an &shy;Inverness lad and began his career in the city.
But his dad Donald never got the chance to see the side become one of football’s rising powers.
Mike admitted watching John Hughes’s squad play Falkirk at Hampden Park will be emotional.
He said: “My dad passed away when he was 62 so he never had the chance to see Caley do such great things.

“He would have been over the moon if he had seen them making it into the league, let alone reach the dizzy heights of a Scottish Cup final.
“He loved Caley and that rubbed off on me. He took me to the games when I was a young boy and I was just hooked.”
Mike and Donald went to see Caledonian FC, whose merger with Inverness Thistle in 1994 to become Caledonian Thistle enabled them to join the Scottish Football League, reaching the SPL for the first time in 2004.
 

Had it not been for Donald, Mike might have grown up supporting Highland League side &shy;Clachnacuddin instead.
He said: “My dad grew up in the Ferry, an area that was considered pretty rough in Inverness.
“In that area, people tended to support Clachnacuddin but he went against the grain by being a Caley supporter. I was always destined to be a Caley fan.”
Mike will be wearing his lucky scarf knitted by his mum as he takes his seat on Saturday.
It will be a high point for the city where he began as a trainee &shy;newspaper reporter in 1986.

A major in the Army Reserves, he was mobilised for active service in Afghanistan and Iraq.
He said: “It certainly is a change of pace watching Inverness Caley Thistle rather than dodging bombs and bullets in warzones.
“I can’t wait for the big game. I would urge John and the boys not to get caught up in the hype.
“They need to keep the head and play the game, not the occasion.”

  Crawford 83â€²  
 Ali Crawford fired home the winner for Hamilton Accies with just seven minutes remaining to defeat St Mirren. 
 He picked his spot at Marian Kello's left post with a delicious low shot which left the Buddies goalkeeper rooted. 
 It was richly deserved for the home side who were the better outfit throughout. 
 St Mirren new boss Ian Murray was in the stand, with Gary Teale in charge for the last time. 
 Murray will have quickly realised that St Mirren's relegation was no fluke, in a display short on confidence, creativity and shots on goal, evident throughout. 
 Accies were the dominant side in the first half with visiting 'keeper Kello tested regularly. 
 In the fifth minute Imrie fired a shot from inside the box which Kello saved comfortably, then the 'keeper beat away a stinging Crawford free kick from twenty five yards. 
 The visitors replied when a Stephen Mallan free kick rattled the Accies bar. 
 But the home side were soon on the offensive again and Jesus Garcia Tena's free kick thundered off Kello's near post. 
 Crawford twice in succession fired in low efforts which the St Mirren stopper saved well before thwarting Louis Longridge from netting on the stroke of half time when he sprung to his right to parry his shot. 
 The second half saw Accies continue to dominate, but goal-scoring opportunities were absent. An end of season feel prevailed, with neither side playing at any great tempo. 
 Accies were sharper and slicker, as they had been in the opening 45 minutes, but their season has been one of high achievement, while the Buddies will need to regroup and find a promotion push, in what is likely to be a highly competitive Scottish Championship next season. 
 With ten minutes to go there was warm applause for a fleeting appearance from Jason Scotland who has given Accies sterling service in his time at the club. 
 And he bows out with a win, courtesy of a fine finish from the ever impressive Crawford.

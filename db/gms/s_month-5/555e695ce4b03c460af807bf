Nearly 90 jobs are to be shed at computer giant IBM's Spango Valley call centre in Inverclyde, it has emerged.
A total of 89 technical support staff in Greenock are affected, most of whom are agency workers employed by Manpower. 
The recruitment firm said the employees were reaching the end of their &quot;assignments&quot;, but no dates were given. 
IBM said it was continuing to &quot;rebalance its workforce to meet the changing requirements of its clients&quot;.
It is understood the roles are to be moved to Bulgaria.
In a statement, Manpower said: &quot;Manpower has launched a communication process with employees working in some technical support roles at IBM Greenock in relation to the end of their assignments. 
&quot;We will provide support for those affected by offering CV and interview workshops and actively seeking alternative roles and assignments for them.&quot;
An IBM spokeswoman said: &quot;IBM continues to rebalance its workforce to meet the changing requirements of its clients, and to pioneer new, high value segments of the IT industry.&quot;
Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said: &quot;The council has made contact with IBM and Manpower to offer whatever help can be given to keep jobs in Inverclyde. 
&quot;We have been told the company hopes that all affected staff will be able to take up alternative opportunities in the call centre industry. 
&quot;IBM has a long and proud history in Inverclyde with close links to our communities and it is important we as a council do all that we can to maintain those links.&quot;

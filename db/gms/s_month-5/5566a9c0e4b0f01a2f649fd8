STEWART PATERSONPolitical CorrespondentTHE programme for the first full year of Tory majority government in nearly 20 years was set out in the Queen's speech.No tax rises, a benefits freeze and welfare cuts accompanied by anti strike legislation and pension reforms will all be put in place in the next year.The agenda for the next five years follows the last parliament with a focus on balancing the budget.The Queen's speech began with the commitment to &quot;bringing the public finances under control and reducing the deficit so Britain lives within its means&quot;.Announcements on bills including on the economy, constitution, welfare, NHS and industrial relations followed.After the speech Labour warned against Scotland being disadvantaged by constitutional change and the SNP said the government was taking the wrong approach on the economy.The Queen announced her government would bring forward a total of 21 Bills.The most anticipated were constitution related with a referendum on the European Union within two years and more powers for the Scottish Parliament with a new Scotland bill expected later today.It was confirmed the Tories would press ahead with plans to reform strike laws to make it more difficult for public sector workers to take industrial action.A 50% turnout threshold will be imposed and new laws will be introduced to stop public sector strikes going ahead unless 40% of all eligible workers eligible vote in favour.Bills on welfare, no income tax or national insurance rises for five years and for the NHS to be a seven day a week operation were also announced.On welfare a Full Employment and Welfare Benefits Bill will impose a freeze on almost all most working-age welfare payments.Tax credits and child benefit will remain static and a cap of &pound;23,000 per household will be put in place 18-21-year-olds will no longer be automatically entitled to housing benefit.Bills on data protection allowing security services access to more personal information and high speed rail will also be brought in the coming year.High Speed Rail is being built from south to north starting with London to Birmingham and expected to reach cities in the north of England eventually, but no plans are in place to extend it further to Glasgow or Edinburgh.First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said it failed to grasp the new political reality in Scotland following the election.She said &quot;The key problem with this Queen's Speech as far as Scotland is concerned is that it does not take account of the dramatically changed political circumstances we now find ourselves in.&quot;At a time when people are suffering the impact of austerity - with the most serious effects falling on some of the most vulnerable in society - we believe it is quite wrong to continue with an economic policy which involves more savage cuts to welfare provision.&quot;Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary and sole Scottish MP Ian Murray said Scotland must not be damaged by the delivery of more powers.He said: &quot;The tabling of the Scotland Bill is a significant moment. We will work to ensure the &quot;Vow&quot; made during the referendum is delivered in full, and that means keeping the Barnett Formula alongside more powers to make the Scottish Parliament one of the most powerful devolved Parliaments in the world.&quot;

Inverclyde Council is to donate &pound;10,000 towards the relief effort in Nepal following two devastating earthquakes.
More than 8,000 people are believed to have died when the largest earthquake in 80 years, measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale, struck on 25 April.
The death toll rose again when a second quake, measuring 7.4, hit on 12 May.
Council leader Stephen McCabe said: &quot;No one can fail to have been moved by the misery and trauma being endured by the people of Nepal.&quot;
He added: &quot;Thousands have been killed and millions more are living in areas hit by the tremors, many of them in makeshift shelters. 
&quot;This money will go some way to helping aid agencies respond quickly.&quot;

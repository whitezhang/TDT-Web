 A HEADTEACHER who lost his job after being caught in a pub with cocaine has been struck off the register. 
 Mark Turner, the former head of Dumfries High School, was cautioned by police along with a woman last year after he was caught with the class A drug. 
Police were called to the pub in Carlisle on June 28 after Mr Turner was seen “acting suspiciously” in the premises.
He was removed from the bar by officers before being searched and arrested on suspicion of possessing a controlled drug.
Mr Turner was cautioned over the incident but not charged. He did not return to his post at Dumfries High.
At a hearing of the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) on Tuesday, he was struck off the teaching register at his own request.
Mr Turner did not attend the hearing and was not represented. However the panel has documentation from the teacher stating “his wish” to be removed from the register.
Papers relating to the meeting published by the GTCS state: “In light of the respondent’s consent to removal from the register (as set out in his declaration) the panel decided to direct that the respondent be so removed.”
He will not be able to apply to be placed back on the register for two years.
Mr Turner, in a declaration to the GTCS, stated that he “admits in full the allegation made against me relating to my fitness to teach” and “freely and willingly consent to being removed from the register”.

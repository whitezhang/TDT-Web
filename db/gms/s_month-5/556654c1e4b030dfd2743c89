Gym memberships are also available for non-residents.Bosses say the venue's Urban Bar and Grill restaurant will also provide travellers with the best of local produce.Members of the public will also be able to sign for a gym membership at the Pacific Drive venue, providing access to the Technogym's ARTIS range.This is the third Scottish hotel for the chain, following successful openings in Aberdeen and Edinburgh and five more sites are planned for south of the border.Jamie Stevens, general manager, said the new location is perfect for the 120 bedroom hotel.He said: &quot;Finnieston has been up and coming for several years seeing major media businesses setting up home on the River Clyde. Since the SSE Hydro opened in October 2013 it has put Finnieston and Glasgow on the worlds stage.&quot;This has allowed Finnieston to flourish with a multitude of trendy bars and restaurants making it one of the must go areas in Glasgow for a night out.&quot;The continued success of Glasgow and more particular the businesses in Finnieston gives a perfect platform to launch a new hotel.&quot;Jamie, 34, who won manager of the Year for Scotland at the Scottish Hotel Awards 2015, has cherrypicked his team as final preparations get under way for the July opening.He added: &quot;I have only employed three new people that I do not fully know.&quot;For the launch of the hotel we will be doing staged events showcasing different parts of the events.&quot;Other hotel attractions include 42 inch LED TV's as standard with the Upperdeck (Superior rooms) 50 inch with the full SKY package. Free Wi-Fi and free car parking is also available and it is hoped the venue will be used for major events and weddings.

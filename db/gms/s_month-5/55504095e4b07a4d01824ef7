MORE than 3,000 people signed a petition supporting landlords and letting agents in the Private Rented Sector in Scotland and opposing the introduction of rent controls.The petition calls for the Scottish Government and MSPs to recognise the importance of the Private Rented Sector (PRS) in Scotland.Echoing the voice of the wider sector the petition argues that proposals such as the introduction of rent controls and the removal of a the landlord's right to terminate a tenancy at the end of the agreed lease period would have a detrimental effect upon the landlord investment that is necessary to meet the rising demand in the sector.Chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords John Blackwood said: &quot;Gathering almost 3,000 signatures in such a short space of time is astonishing and testament to how concerned landlords and agents are by some of these Scottish Government proposals and the impact they could have on the housing market in Scotland.&quot;The vast majority of the 330,000 tenants in the PRS rely on the flexibility that renting provides primarily due to cost and location in relation to the changing jobs market. Whilst we agree that some changes to the current regime are necessary, we would urge the Scottish Government to consider the wider implications of what is being proposed.&quot;Landlords and agents across Scotland have used this petition to make their voices heard and now we hope that the Scottish Government listens.&quot;

 SCOTTISH soldiers have marked their last few days in Germany by holding their final Highland Games in the country. 
 Squaddies from the Highlanders and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards donned their kilts for a tartan -clad festival of piping and caber tossing. 
 

Craftsman Keir Marshall, of the Highlanders, said: “It’s just a good day when everyone gets together and people enjoy themselves and have a bit of friendly competition.”
It was the troops’ final fling as the Army prepare to leave Fallingbostel, south of Hamburg, after 70 years.
 

Last week, the departing units marched through the town and officials presented them with the Federal Fahnenband, a ribbon of honour, in recognition of their service in and to Germany.
The Highlanders, or 4 SCOTS, will move to Catterick in Yorkshire and the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards to Fife this summer.
 

 Colonel Andy Reynolds, commander of the Bergen-Hohne Garrison, said: “Following  70 years of tremendous support, it is with deep regret that we leave Fallingbostel. 
“What began in war is ending in peace and enduring friendship.
“We take this opportunity to celebrate those friendships and thank our German hosts who have supported us in our time here.”

DAVID CAMERON said he has put Britain first over the last five years and will do so again for the next five years.Mr Cameron, campaigning in London with Mayor Boris Johnson said he still believed he can win an outright majority.Speaking of how he responded in 2010 to not achieving a majority he said: &quot;I put the country first, I formed a coalition. I did what was right to give strong government for Britain. So I will always put the country first.&quot;He dismissed suggestions Tories should vote tactically for LibDems against Labour.He said: &quot;I have a very clear message for anyone in a Liberal Democrat-held seat and that is vote Conservative.&quot;Nick Clegg was very clear at the weekend he is just as likely to support an Ed Miliband-SNP government ... as he is to support the Conservatives.&quot;Mr Clegg said if the LibDems were not involved in a government after the election there would be another before Christmas.He said minority government would be chaotic claiming the Tories would need to pander to Ukip and Labour to the SNP.He said: &quot;The last thing Britain needs is a second election before Christmas. But that is exactly what will happen if Ed Miliband and David Cameron put their own political interest ahead of the national interest.&quot;Mr Miliband warned the NHS was under threat from Tory privatisation plans and further budget cuts.He said there was a &quot;cash crisis made in Downing Street&quot; which would mean most English hospitals having to cut staff, beds and services this year.The Labour leader said: &quot;&quot;There is no bigger choice at this election for everyone in our country than the future facing our National Health Service.&quot;Right now, our NHS is in grave danger because David Cameron has broken his promises on the NHS.&quot;

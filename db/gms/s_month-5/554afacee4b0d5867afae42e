WELL let's be honest, there was really only one thing I could write about today and it wasn't the fact that I'm turning 35 tomorrow but the less said about that utterly depressing fact the better.No, as the country takes to the polls today to decide which party should rule the United Kingdom down in Westminster, we should probably have a wee blether about that instead.The build up has been highly amusing and often hysterical, words generally not used to describe the run up to a general election but there you have it.It's fair to say that it's been pretty clear for sometime now that the SNP in Scotland are on course to gain a fair few more seats than the six they currently hold in the House of Commons and as a result of this inevitable fact the English media has gone into full political armageddon spin that Malcolm Tucker himself would be proud of.We've seen the billboards of former First Minister Alex Salmond with the three main party leaders tucked neatly into his jacket pocket.We've read the stories on how our current First Minister shouldn't be trusted because as a child she once cut the hair off of her sister's Sindy or was it Barbie doll?Anyway whatever poor wee plastic hottie fell victim to the chop the story horrified and shocked some voters who dubbed it simply 'dollgate' which of course ended up all over the news and trending on Twitter, terrifying stuff indeed.Both Ed Miliband and David Cameron have confirmed that their parties would not under any circumstances form a coalition with the SNP should they each fail to win with an overall majority.And various different English papers have echoed these sentiments with one even going to the trouble of drawing up a strategy plan giving readers step by step advice on how to tactically stop a Labour/SNP alliance describing it as a coalition of chaos, the beginning of the end and my favourite, a fate worse than death.All a tad dramatic I'm sure you'll agree and slightly baffling to be honest because if we rewind the clocks toSeptember last year the messaging regarding Scotland was a very different one.All the major parties and their leaders stood side by side publicly urging, no actually begging Scotland to remain part of the union because we were such an important part of the UK and I quote, 'Better Together'.We had celebrities like Eddie Izzard, John Barrowman, Michelle Mone, to name a few adding their names in support of a No Vote in the Referendum and in the end Scotland decide to stay in a union that so clearly wanted and respected her as an equal partner, or maybe not, as it's now transpired.What the Better Together message should have actually said was, &quot;Imagine Westminster is an episode of The Big Bang Theory and Scotland is Howard's mum. We hear you making a lot of noise and you're a great character in the show but we never actually want to see you in person ok?&quot;The point that everyone seems to be missing is that we live in a democracy which means each individual person can vote for whichever candidate and party they choose.If Scotland decides that the SNP will take most of the available Scottish seats in the House of Commons then the other parties will have to respect that and get on with it.We are either currently an equal part of this Union or not.I'm hoping though that most people will actually go out and vote tomorrow for the person or party they aresupporting because a vote not cast would certainly be the biggest tragedy of all in my opinion.Whatever the outcome if you have made your voice heard through your vote no one could ask for anymore.It's interesting times indeed and none more so than tomorrow morning when the results come through.The Southside Fringe kicks off tomorrow and it's set to be a two week extravaganza of music, comedy and arts.With 41 official Fringe venues and more than 170 events, this will be the biggest festival the Southside of Glasgow has ever seen.Being a very proud Southside resident I couldn't be happier that this event is taking place and organisers Crawford Smith and Corinna Currie have even hailed the festival as a credible challenger to the West End's title as Glasgow's cultural hub.With so much to choose from there is no excuse not to get involved and support this fantastic event.The Southside Festival runs from May 8 to 24.For more information log onto www.southsidefringe.org.ukYes tomorrow I turn the rip old age of 35 and I find myself muttering things like, &quot;Why God, Why?&quot; And, &quot;How did this happen?&quot;Anyway thanks to a website called www.howold.net it turns out I only look 24 apparently so I'm grabbing it with both hands, considering it legally binding and amending my official documents and showreel as we speak.It's the little things really :)

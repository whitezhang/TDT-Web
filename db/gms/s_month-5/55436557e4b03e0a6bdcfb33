A Scottish graphic designer has given the controversial Protein World campaign a revamp to include curvier models.Barrington Reeves, 23, from Partick produced a more 'body positive' line of posters depicting people of all shapes and sizes - changing the slogan from: &quot;Are you beach body ready?&quot; to lines like: &quot;Everybody is ready.&quot;The controversial Protein World adverts in London caused an uproar due to its message pictured alongside a slim model - suggesting that those who do not conform should not feel comfortable baring skin in summer clothes. &nbsp;Barrington, who has been running his company Too Gallus since July last year, thinks that the Protein World campaign was clever as it raised the brand's profile, but said that it also alienated people who do not conform to those beauty standards.He said: &quot;I think that even though this ad isn't going to go up on a billboard anywhere it might still help people find a little confidence in themselves.&quot;I would hope a campaign like ours would not only inspire a little body confidence in the people who see it, but also remind companies putting out campaigns that are going to be in the public eye to be responsible with their marketing and the messages that they are sending to the public.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advertising Standards Agency is investigating the Protein World campaign after receiving 216 complaints relating to the potentially &quot;offensive, irresponsible and harmful&quot; nature of the advertising and that it could be promoting body image issues.Many people vandalised the posters with body positive messages in protest, saying that women are ready to bare and worthy of wearing a bikini whatever size they are.Protein World marketing boss Richard Staveley hit back at critics, calling the vandals &quot;terrorists&quot; and accused them of 'fit-shaming.'He said: &quot;We want to encourage discussion on this. Ultimately we want to encourage a healthier, fitter nation. We want to encourage everybody to be the very best version of themselves.&quot;Staveley also took a rigorous approach to complaints on Twitter.&quot;This is not feminism, it is extremism,&quot; and also said: &quot;We won't apologise to the irrational extremists who are causing criminal damage to our adverts.&quot;In a tweet directed at others, the brand said: &quot;Surely as a feminists [sic] Vicky, you understand that no one takes you seriously?&quot;The account tweeted at another Twitter user saying: &quot;Sales have tripled, but your salary is still the same.&quot;The company also claimed on social media that we are a &quot;nation of sympathisers for fatties&quot;, and in a separate tweet directed at a critic the brand said &quot;why make your insecurities our problem&quot;.What do you think?

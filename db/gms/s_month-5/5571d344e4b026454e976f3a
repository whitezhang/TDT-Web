A SAILOR who died after going to sea in a boat he made out of car parts has been named.
 Thomas Tyrell, believed to be in his 60s, left Broadbay on the Isle of Lewis in the small unconventional vessel at 7am on Tuesday. 
But the alarm was raised after he failed to return to harbour by 8pm.
 Tyrrell’s body was found a short distance from his boat, near Bayble, on Wednesday. 
The sailor is thought to have lived in Tong on Lewis.
 A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The missing boat was traced north of an area known as the Minch. 
“Police can now confirm that the body of a man has sadly been recovered not far from where the boat was located.
“Enquiries are ongoing into this matter and a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.”

 TWO cycling fans saved the day for a tearful four-year-old who was told he couldn’t ride his dream bike home from a shop. 
Harley Stephen’s stepmum Gemma Paterson decided to treat him to a new bike after he learned to ride without stabilisers.
 The delighted youngster picked out his favourite at Halfords in Perth – only to burst into tears when he was told it would take three days to build it. 
After Gemma and distraught Harley left the shop, they were approached by Tony Fletcher and his friend who offered to help.
Gemma, 27, said: “They came up to me and said ‘We were behind you in the queue and we see how upset Harley is. If you go buy the bike we’ll build it out in the street for you.’
“Harley was over the moon so we bought the bike and the guys did it outside. It took 20 minutes. It was so nice of them.”

In their rush to get home to take the bike out on Monday, Gemma forgot to get their names.
So the childcare worker, from Bridge of Earn, Perthshire, tried to trace them on Facebook.
She posted pictures of the pair and Harley on his bike. It got more than 76,000 likes and was shared 18,000 times.
And Gemma struck gold when a friend of Tony, 38, saw it.
She posted: “A massive massive thank you. Nice to know there are kindhearted people out there.”
Tony, from Dundee, said: “I was just in the right place at the right time. The wee boy obviously wanted to go out on it that day.
“I had my tools with me so I told her I could do it for her.”
Halfords are investigating why staff were unable to build the bike that day and gave Harley a &pound;50 voucher.

Police investigating a shooting and an unrelated attack in Glasgow have spoken to more than 130 people and dozens of motorists a week on from the incidents.
Officers questioned people close to Gary's Barber Shop in Springburn, where a man, 29, was attacked on 7 May.
They also spoke to people in Royston Road where another man, also 29, was run over and then shot in a targeted attack later the same day.
Police said they were grateful for all responses to Thursday night's appeals.
In the shooting incident, which is being treated as attempted murder, the victim got out of his Audi car on Royston Road at about 18:30 before he was &quot;deliberately&quot; struck by a white Mitsubishi 4x4.
A man then got out of the car and shot him while he was on the ground.
The car made off at speed from the area, being driven &quot;erratically&quot;, and was recovered in Robroyston a short time later.
Officers returned to the area on Thursday and stopped 40 vehicles and spoke to more than 130 people.
In the barbers attack, two men entered the shop and approached the victim, who was then attacked by one of the men.
The suspects then left the shop and drove off.
Police said the victim required hospital treatment for &quot;lacerations to his head&quot;.
Officers returned to Springburn Way on Thursday night and stopped more than 40 vehicles in the area and spoke to drivers.
Det Con Gary Boyle said: &quot;Officers are very grateful to the public in the north of Glasgow who assisted with our inquiries yesterday. 
&quot;Information received has been passed to the investigation team for consideration. 
&quot;We are still keen to hear from anyone with information about either of these incidents.&quot; 
He added: &quot;Officers have already reviewed CCTV footage from the areas where these incidents happened, and carried out extensive door-to-door inquiries. 
&quot;While we've been happy with the response to our initial inquiry, we welcome any further information from the public.&quot;

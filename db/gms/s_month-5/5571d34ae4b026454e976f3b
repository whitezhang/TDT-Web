THE parents of a teenager gunned down in the street have used his 18th birthday to appeal for information about his murder.
Kevin Wilson, 17, was shot in the back in Liverpool in February.
The teenager, originally from Viewpark, Lanarkshire, died from a single gunshot wound.
Six people have been arrested but no one has been charged.
Yesterday, the victim’s mum Jane said: “It has been the hardest three months of my life. The pain never goes away and it just gets worse every day.
“It is even more devastating today on what would have been Kevin’s 18th birthday. I feel completely heartbroken.”
 Kevin’s dad Paul said: “We are still waiting for justice to be done. Until you lose a child or a brother in such circumstances, you can’t understand the pain and suffering brought  to our family. 
“We would like to see those responsible for taking Kevin away from us face up to what they have done.”
Kevin and his family had recently moved to Liverpool, after living in London for several years.

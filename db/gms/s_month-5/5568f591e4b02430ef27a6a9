 Partick Thistle have handed Steven Lawless a new contract a week after the midfielder was found guilty of breaching Scottish FA betting rules. 
 The 24-year-old was given a six-match ban, although four of those are suspended for good behaviour. 
 But he has earned a new one-year deal with the Scottish Premiership club. 
 Lawless joined the Glasgow club from Motherwell in 2012 and has made 111 appearances, 38 of them in the current campaign.

POLICE are growing increasingly concerned for a man who has been missing from his home in Glasgow for five days.
John Murphy, 52, of Craigpark Drive in Dennistoun, left his house at 7am on Tuesday to head to work at Easthall Park Housing Co-operative in Easterhouse.
But he did not arrive for work and hasnâ€™t been seen since.
Mr Murphy is described as 5ft 8in tall, of medium build, with short brown hair and is usually clean shaven.
At the time of his disappearance, the dad of five was believed to be wearing a beige polo shirt, black cargo trousers, black work boots and a black waterproof jacket.
Police at Shettleston are now appealing for information as to his whereabouts. Anyone with information can call 101.

A DOG was brutally attacked before being weighed down with stone slabs and thrown in a pond.
 The SSPCA are appealing for help to catch those responsible for the sick act after the discovery in water at Newmains in North Lanarkshire on Friday. 
 A post-mortem on the young female Staffordshire bull terrier type dog discovered it was struck on the head, neck and body but it's not know if it was still breathing when thrown into the pond. 
 Inspector Heather Lawson, from the animal welfare charity, said the dog had been in the water for 24 to 48 hours before being found in the pond at Overtown Road. 
She urged anyone with information about what happened to the dog to get in contact.
Ms Lawson said: &quot;Although the trauma to her head and neck was significant it would have been unlikely to be the cause of death, which is unexplained at this stage. It is not yet known if she was still breathing when she entered the water.
&quot;The dog had been weighed down with two large, slab-like stones which had been tied to her lead.
&quot;She was a young brown female Staffordshire bull terrier type and other than her injuries was in good bodily condition.
&quot;She was a very unusual colour for this breed as this shade of brown is more commonly seen in Patterdale terriers or chocolate labradors.
&quot;We would appeal to anyone who recognises the description of this dog and knows who may have done this to her to contact us on 03000 999 999.&quot;

Islanders volunteered to promote their isles in a new TV advert for Caledonian MacBrayne's ferry network.
The 30-second commercial featuring residents of Mull, Iona and Tiree will be shown for the first time on 11 May.
The advert's soundtrack is a cover of Supergrass hit Alright by Celtic band Macanta, with some lines of the song sung by the islanders.
CalMac's head of marketing Peter Griffiths said there was &quot;no need to cajole anyone&quot; to take part.
Mr Griffiths said: &quot;They were really excited about it and we got a great response.&quot;
The islanders who appear in the advert include Neil Jardine, a fisherman from Iona, and Hannah and Andy Wright and their family from Tiree.
Also featured are Tobermory fish and chip van servers Natalie Livingston and Rebecca Woolcock.

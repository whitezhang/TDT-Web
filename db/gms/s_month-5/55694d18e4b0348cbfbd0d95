A primary school boy who has grown his hair for a year so he can donated it to kids with cancer who need a wig is set to have it cut off in front of his whole school.Eight year-old Joseph Griffiths has raised &pound;710 for Yorkhill Children's Charity by growing his hair so he can donate it to the Little Princes Trust- a charity who provide wigs to boys and girls who have lost their own hair because of cancer treatment.The primary 3 pupil at St Columbkilles Primary School in Rutherglen will have his hair cut on Thursday 28 May at a school assembly in front of around 400 pupils and staff members.Joseph's mother, Claire, 42, said her son made the decision last year while having his hair cut. She said: &quot;Joseph has always had very thick mop of hair and when he was having it cut the hairdresser said to him that there were kids who grow their hair and then donate it to kids who lost theirs because of cancer.&quot;Afterwards he said to me that he wanted to do it. I was quite surprised, he's only eight and most kids that young wouldn't raise money for charity.&quot;He knows that he's a lucky wee boy and is conscious that other kids aren't as lucky as him.&quot;Joseph's hair is now just beyond shoulder length and has proven difficult to maintain for his mother.Claire continued: &quot;The last couple months have been tough, it's very thick and it's a bit of a challenge trying to get a brush through it in the morning.&quot;A lot of the other parents think he looks super cool though.Joseph started learning to play the guitar 2 months ago and his favourite band is Supergrass.Reflecting on his decision he said: &quot;I thought I would be nervous about doing it but I wasn't. I'm just glad I can help.&quot;I'm looking forward to getting in cut because it's quite difficult to brush it all in the mornings.&quot;Some of the people at school think it's cool but then I think some don't.Kirsten Sinclair, Director of Fundraising at Yorkhill Children's Charity, said:&quot;Joseph is an incredibly thoughtful young man and we are delighted to have his support.&quot;The money that Joseph has raised will help the 160,000 boys and girls who are treated at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children each year.&quot;We'd like to thank Joseph on behalf of all of our patients and their families.&quot;

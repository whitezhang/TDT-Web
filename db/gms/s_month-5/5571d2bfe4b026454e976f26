IN this video clip a motorist is using his mobile phone to a film a bus on fire whilst driving past it.
It appears that the footage is shot from the driver’s seat and the driver even takes his eyes completely off the road, to film the bus through the passenger window.
The incident happened on the A1 southbound on Thursday evening close to Wallyford.
 Video was later posted to Facebook and appears on Scotland's Worst Drivers . 
Patsy Clark, commented: “Looks like person driving car was taking video!
“That’s really stupid another accident waiting to happen.”
James McLoughlin, spokesperson for Brake, the road safety charity, said: “Attempting any type of multitasking at the wheel increases your chances of causing a crash and killing or seriously injuring yourself or somebody else.
“Even at low speeds, using a phone to record videos at the wheel is very dangerous, as your reactions will be significantly impaired.
“We urge all drivers to switch off their phones and keep them out of reach to remove temptation.”

Former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont has called for safety to be improved at cemeteries following the death of an eight-year-old boy.
Ciaran Williamson died in what his family described as a &quot;tragic accident&quot; involving a falling headstone at a cemetery in Cardonald on Tuesday.
Ms Lamont, MSP for Glasgow Pollock, said she sympathised with the family.
She said: &quot;These are public spaces, we need to make sure they are safe if the public are going to be in them.&quot;
Speaking to BBC Scotland, Ms Lamont added: &quot;You can only imagine, as parents, what it must be like for a child to go out to play and then not come back.
&quot;I do think we need to look at how we make sure places like graveyards are safe. 
&quot;I understand the Scottish government is currently consulting to bring forward a bill around burials, crematoriums and cemeteries and I think that is an opportunity to look at that.&quot;
Two 10-year-olds were also injured in the incident which police said was not being treated as suspicious.

STAFF say they are facing pressure to discharge new mums at a Glasgow maternity hospital because of bed shortages.They claim the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital is struggling to cope because the health board has moved urology patients from Gartnavel, including men, into the hospital.Ward 6AB of Gartnavel, a mixed urology ward, has been relocated to ward 70 of the maternity hospital, where new mums recover after they have given birth.Unison said it was &quot;extremely concerned&quot; by reports from staff and said it had voiced concerns about the move.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said maternity beds had been relocated elsewhere in the hospital and denied the move had led to a reduction.However staff have reported that new mums are being &quot;encouraged&quot; to leave before they are ready, including during the night. They claim mothers of premature babies who are being cared for in special care units are being discharged the same day.It is standard practice for mums to be able to spend the first night in hospital with their babies.A spokeswoman for NHSGGC said: &quot;There has been no reduction in the number of maternity beds.&quot;The PRMH had empty accommodation and it has been planned for some time to expand our urology service utilising this space.&quot;We have transferred some maternity beds to another floor in the unit so that urology could be on the one floor and distinct from maternity.&quot;No woman is encouraged to leave hospital.&quot;The majority of women go home before 10.00pm but there are a small number of women who do leave after 10.00pm at their request and only if they are clinically fit to do so.&quot;It is disappointing that staff are making inaccurate claims on the bed capacity at the PRMH as a result of the move.&quot;Unison Scotland Regional Organiser Matt McLaughlin said: &quot;Unison is extremely concerned by these reports.&quot;We did not support the move because we felt it could compromise patient safety.&quot;If patients or midwives believe safety is being compromised we would urge them to use internal processes to complain to the appropriate authorities.&quot;Rather than express disappointment and dismiss the views of hard working staff at the coal face, NHSGGC would do better to listen and react in the interests of patients before there is a significant adverse incident.&quot;

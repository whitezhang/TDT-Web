THE driving force behind Scotland's largest bus operator has been shortlisted for a prestigious UK-wide industry award.Fiona Kerr, managing director of First Glasgow and two other top industry professionals are in the running for the 'Leader of the Year' title at the 2015 FTA everywoman in Transport and Logistics Awards.She took over the top job in 2013 becoming the first female managing director of any of First Group's UK local bus businesses.Since then, customer satisfaction levels have increased and the company successfully moved thousands of people about during the Commonwealth Games - the biggest challenge the firm has ever faced.Ms Kerr has also overseen the roll-out of 226 new buses, an investment of &pound;37million, with further significant investment in the fleet to follow in the coming year.Under her stewardship, First Glasgow launched its M-ticketing scheme, letting customers use their smart phones as tickets and pushed to increase free passenger wifi across First Glasgow's fleet to above 50%.Ms Kerr said: &quot;I'm delighted to have been nominated for the everywoman award, and to see the efforts of my whole team at First Glasgow recognised for an unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional service.&quot;Part of our strategy for success is to put the customer at the heart of what we do and to challenge ourselves to be the best company we can be - not just the best bus company.&quot;I've been delighted to see this approach result in great passenger satisfaction scores, independently verified with 90% either satisfied or very satisfied. It's incredibly important that we keep delivering for those who rely on us to access work, education, and health and leisure facilities each and every day.&quot;John Cahill, First Glasgow's business director Glasgow City, added: &quot;Fiona is that rare breed of leader who is able to create and communicate a vision and provide visible leadership and support through all levels of the business, inspiring her team and acting as a catalyst to drive improvement.&quot;She has made an incredible difference since assuming the role of managing director, evidenced in our employee survey results and customer satisfaction scores.&quot;The 2015 FTA everywoman in Transport &amp; Logistics Awards were established eight years ago to highlight the achievements of inspirational role models across an industry which forms the backbone of the UK's economy.By championing women in what is traditionally a predominately male industry, everywoman and its partners hope to encourage more into the sector, to plug the skills-gap and ensure a more diverse, population-representative workforce.First Glasgow has also been shortlisted in four categories at the Scottish Transport Awards, one of the transport industry's most respected award ceremonies.

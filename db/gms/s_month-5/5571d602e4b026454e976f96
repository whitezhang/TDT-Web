 TWO boys aged 10 are thought to have been behind a school garden wrecking spree . 
 Members of the gardening club at St Paul’s Primary in Paisley , who spent 18 months creating the playground project, were devastated when they turned up for lessons on Wednesday and found their fruit and veg patches had been torn up and plant pots shattered. 
And yesterday police revealed two 10-year-old boys have been reported to the Children’s Panel in connection with the incident.
After the vandals struck on Tuesday night, nine-year-old Daniel Davidson said: “We all feel very sad right now.
“We spent so long working in the garden to grow flowers, fruit and vegetables and now it’s all been ruined.
“Why would anyone want to do this to our garden?”
 

Headteacher Louise Maher was sickened by the attack.
She told our sister paper the Paisley Daily Express: “The children, parents and staff have worked tirelessly this year to improve our school grounds.
“They have given up their time to plant bulbs and vegetables and applied for grants to support them in this venture.
“In total, more than &pound;1000 was spent creating this outdoor area.”
Classroom assistant Eileen Connell, who helps to run the gardening club, issued an appeal to the local community to pitch in and help the pupils rebuild the garden.
She said: “The children have been left absolutely gutted by this vandalism but we’ve assured them that all the hard work they put in over the past year-and-a-half will not be wasted.”

Matthew Phiri, who lives on the top floor, six floors above the blaze, said: &quot;It was traumatising. There was smoke and I looked out of the window and saw the flames.&quot;I ran downstairs, all eighteen floors. There was a man going up as I was going down and I told him we had to get out.&quot;When we got outside there was five or six people outside. I was relieved to get out.&quot;The fire is believed to have begun on the twelfth floor of 140 Charles Street.&nbsp;The residents who live in the property were too upset to speak.&nbsp;Neighbour Richard Smith said: &quot;I stay on the twelfth floor. It happened next door to me.&quot;My veranda started filling up with smoke so I shut the door, got a hold of my wife and ran down the stairs. It happened just after half five.&quot;There was no smoke in the stairs or the lift area at that time. There wasn't a lot of people coming out to begin with. There was no communication.&quot;We weren't told where to go. We were standing outside at first then the police said they'd need to cordon it off. Me and my wife are alright. I just hope everyone else is.&quot;Evacuated residents are gathering in a nearby cafe waiting for advice on what to do next.Another resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'The police came to the door and told us we had to get out. Everyone is gathering at a cafe at 160 so we're going there.&nbsp;&quot;There are so many people in that building. I hope everyone else got out.&quot;Five fire appliances, including those from Springburn and Cowcaddens fire stations, and 40 firefighters are currently on the scene.Fire crews wearing breathing apparatus are carrying out a detailed search of the property.There are no reports of injuries at this time.

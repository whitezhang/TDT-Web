EVENING Times columnist Humza Yousaf has opened up about the first time he felt he was targeted because of his faith.The Scottish Government Minister and SNP Glasgow MSP said he felt like an outsider in Scotland the day after the September 11 attacks happened.Mr Yousaf, who spoke out in this week's Big Issue, said: &quot;At the age of 16 I remember regularly trudging into my morning registration class in high school and sitting next to the same friends every morning, talking about the things normal 16-year-old boys probably still talk about to this very day.&quot;However, on the morning of Wednesday, September 12, 2001, I was left speechless when one of my close friends turned to me and asked: 'Why do Muslims hate us?'&quot;I was expected to know the answer to a question I had no idea about - for no other reason than the religion I practised...I don't for a minute believe my school friend was an Islamophobe, however this was the first time in my life I felt like I was an outsider in my own country due to my faith.&quot;Mr Yousaf also said Muslims were viewed as &quot;fair game&quot; by many people, including Ukip.He talked about how he was compared to convicted terrorist Abu Hamza by Ukip representative David Coburn MEP.He added: &quot;The response from Nigel Farage and senior Ukip members was pitiful, they suggested I grow a thicker skin and accept Coburn's remarks as a joke.&quot;Can you imagine the horror (quite rightly) if anyone suggested a member of the Jewish community just laughed off anti-Semitism?&quot;With the rise of the far right both at home and across the European continent, it is time that we all took an unequivocal stand against Islamophobia.&quot;Politicians can play a leading role in shaping attitudes.&quot;Mr Yousaf's full article is in The Big Issue, guest edited by Owen Jones, out now.

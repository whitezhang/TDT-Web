It is Scotland’s unofficial anthem, and apparently entirely accurate: we WOULD walk 500 miles for love.
According to a survey - and we do wonder how these things get estimated - Glaswegians would travel 499 miles to find love, a little more than the distance between Edinburgh and London. 
And Edinburgh residents would go even further, 543 miles. Maybe Glaswegians got all the good partners first so Edinburgh folk had to venture further. We’ll never know.
The research from eHarmony.co.uk found men were prepared to venture 22 miles further than women, based on looking at 15,000 member profiles.
Glasgow sits at number eight in the top 10 cities willing to travel for love, with Belfast tops at 751 miles. That’s commitment.
Weegies might balk at that distance and say, &quot;I would do anything for love - but I won't do that&quot;.
When you strip out the size of the communities, Dumfries residents are willing to go a staggering 1,058 miles for love. 
In Kirkcaldy, you don’t need to go far - just 41 miles apparently. 
Young people are willing to travel further, as in the distance from London to Prague, where those aged 55-64 wouldn’t consider anything over 365 miles.
And interestingly those earning less than &pound;12,500 are willing to go 615 miles compared to someone earning up to &pound;75,000 who would only bother go to 385 miles.
Jemima Wade, spokeswoman for the dating website, said: &quot;Today we're more mobile than ever - whether its physically upping sticks and moving cities for new job opportunities, or chatting using the likes of Skype and social media. 
“The same goes for relationships. Online dating means we no longer rely on who lives at the end of our street or an introduction from a friend, but as our study shows, us open minded Brits are happy to go that extra mile to find love.&quot;

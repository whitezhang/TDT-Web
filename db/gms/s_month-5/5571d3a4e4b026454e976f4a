FIVE Scots comedians have set the record for the UK’s highest comedy gig after performing at the top of Ben Lomond.
The comics climbed 3192ft to do the charity show at the summit for a crowd of about 100 people.
Comedians and promoters Gary Little and Alan Anderson came up with the idea for Summit Funny last year.
And they roped in Mark Nelson, Vladimir McTavish and Chris Forbes to join them on the bill on Monday.
Mark, 34, said: “It was definitely one of the high points of my comedy career.
“My Edinburgh Fringe show this year is about me being a year older than Jesus. I’ve probably performed to more people on this mountain than I will in Edinburgh during August.
“This was my Sermon on the Mount.”
Gary, 51, and his fellow comics had to lug a PA system to the top. He said: “Alan and I have climbed hills in the past and we spoke about having a gig at the top of a Munro.
“When we were driving up on Monday, we thought there would be maybe 30 or 40 people there. But when we arrived at the summit, we had around 100.”
 

Gary’s performance was interrupted by a National Trust for Scotland ranger, who ended up stealing the show.
He said: “The guy was kicking about barefoot at the top with a shovel, so I got talking to him while I was doing my set. It turned out he was a ranger but his answers were amazing and really funny.”
The gig raised money for Scottish Mountain Rescue teams and the Trossachs Search and Rescue Dogs, who played a vital role in the rescue operation at the Clutha in Glasgow.
 They have raised about &pound;700 so far and hope to boost their total by encouraging more donations at www.justgiving.com/sumitfunny .

 A PAISLEY couple have said they’re not barking mad after handing the role of best man to their pet pooch . 
Tasha Martin’s Border Collie Danny will walk her down the aisle and then perform the best man duties for Gus MacLellan.
 Gus, of Foxbar, told our sister paper the Paisley Daily Express : “Danny is part of our family and there was no way he was going to be left out. 
“We want a small wedding, just the two of us, but Danny was always going to be involved.
“We decided he would be walking down the aisle as my best man and will accompany my bride.
 

“As I’ll be getting married in a kilt, we’re trying to fashion a harness out of the same tartan for Danny to wear. Danny will also have the rings and we’re hoping he can carry them in a wee tartan pouch.
“Normally, dogs aren’t allowed in the church, so it’s good of them to agree to that.”
Gus and Tasha, both 34, have been dating for three years after meeting online.
Although they stay in Paisley, where Tasha is a care home assistant with Renfrewshire Council, they share a love of the Highlands, where she was living when their romance started.
The couple will marry at Avoch Parish Church, on the Black Isle, on Friday, June 5, in what is believed to be the first wedding there for five years.

A VULNERABLE woman has been forced to take refuge with a neighbour after thieves ransacked her home.Anne McGarrigle, 54, from Govanhill, has not been able to return to her flat on Garturk Street since it was targeted by thugs almost three weeks ago.The thieves struck in broad daylight on the May 4, taking jewellery, a TV and even scoffed a box of chocolates.She has been staying with her neighbour Alan Brown, 36, since the break-in.Mrs McGarrigle, who suffers from multiple- sclerosis, angina and COPD, said: &quot;I'm disgusted. I can't go back to my house until its put in order.&quot;The housing association told me that if it isn't to do with the kitchen or bathroom there isn't much they will do.&quot;They boarded up the smashed windows - but then sent a bill for the work.Mrs McGarrigle, who worked in a cutting room for Marks and Spencer for 27 years before retiring due to ill-health 10 years ago, said: &quot;I almost burst into tears when I opened the letter - it was a bill for &pound;120 for boarding up the window.&quot;Mr Brown, who lives close by, took her in after disturbing the thieves.She said: &quot;Alan has been looking after me because I can't go back, the place is just a mess.&quot;When he came and found me and told me that I had been broken into I almost collapsed.&quot;He is going to redecorate for me - I feel too scared to go home with the house like it is.&quot;It was a huge shock I can't believe its happened to me.&quot;Mr Brown, a painter and decorator, said: &quot;I was outside when a guy jumped through my garden.&quot;I chased after him and phoned the police but he got away onto Calder Street.&quot;This is the third break-in to have happened in the area recently.&quot;The housing association hasn't even offered to come out to fit better locks on the windows or doors, they have washed their hands of Anne.&quot;Mrs McGarrigle, who has lived in the area for two years since moving from Castlemilk, lost jewellery given to her by her late father in the raid.She said: &quot;I've lost bracelets and nine rings including one that my dad gave me when I was 18, I will probably never get them back.&quot;&quot;They even had the cheek to open and eat a box chocolates.&quot;I think the police might have gotten a finger print from it though.&quot;A Police Scotland spokesman said that inquiries are ongoing into the incident.A spokesman for Govanhill Housing Association said: &quot;I can confirm that following police attendance after the report of a break in, the police engaged a contractor to board up our tenant's window on 3rd May 2015.&quot;The tenant attended our offices on 5th May 2015, following the holiday weekend, to advise us of the incident.&quot;The Association issued a line to its own contractor to have the window measured for reglazing as agreed with the tenant on Friday 8th May. Unfortunately our contractor could not gain access at this time and access has been re-arranged for tomorrow to start the works.&quot;I am unaware of any contact being made with the Association from Ms McGarrigle for assistance since 5th May 2015 and have arranged for a housing officer to visit her to review matters and the security of her property.&quot;The Association seeks at all times to provide the best possible level of customer care and support to our tenants, particularly in distressing circumstances such as these.&quot;

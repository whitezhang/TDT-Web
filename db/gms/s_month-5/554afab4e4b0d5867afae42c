As polls open and voters make their final decisions, the leaders of Scotland's main political parties were making a final plea for support across the country.Nicola Sturgeon optimistically said the &quot;outlook for Scotland is sunny&quot; during a campaign event yesterday, and said the vote could be a &quot;watershed election&quot;.She also warned voters in the rest of the country that &quot;there is no reason to fear the SNP&quot; and insisted her party would do anything to keep the Tories from re-entering Number 10.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;I don't want David Cameron back into Number 10 and if there is an anti-Tory majority on Friday morning then I want that anti-Tory majority to come together to make sure that David Cameron is not back into Number 10.&quot;But then the SNP will use whatever influence Scotland gives us to make sure the Tories are replaced with something better and bolder and more progressive.&quot;The SNP leader will be in London on Friday to mark VE day, sparking speculation she may be leading post-election negotiations.When questioned, she said: &quot;I'm in London regardless of the outcome on Friday because it is the VE Day commemorations.&quot;That is what I am doing on Friday, representing the Scottish Government, but for now it is over to the Scottish people and, indeed, people across the UK.&quot;She added: &quot;I have been at great pains in this campaign to say to people outside of Scotland that there is no reason to fear the SNP.&quot;You might not agree with us on everything, that is perfectly legitimate and understandable, but we want to send MPs to Westminster to play a positive and constructive role and to make Scotland's voice heard.&quot;I think this could be a watershed election but we will have to wait and see how people vote.&quot;This is an opportunity for Scotland and whether Scotland voted Yes or No in the referendum or have never voted SNP before, it is an opportunity to come together as a country and vote to make our voice heard at Westminster.&quot;She said victory for the SNP was &quot;within touching distance&quot;, after opinion polls suggested Labour is facing a wipe-out in its historic heartlands north of the border to be replaced by SNP MPs.Ms Sturgeon added: &quot;At the heart of this campaign lies this simple truth: the more seats the SNP wins tomorrow, the more power Scotland is going to have, and that is the prize that is now within our grasp.&quot;We are now within touching distance, if we continue to work hard today and tomorrow, of doing something the SNP has never done in our history - winning a Westminster election.&quot;If we do that, then the voice of Scotland is going to be heard more loudly at Westminster than it has ever been heard before.&quot;On Friday morning, whatever the outcome, all of us as politicians have a duty to respect that outcome and if voters across the UK decide not to give Ed Miliband or David Cameron a majority then they are saying that they want parties to work together.&quot;The SNP stands ready to work with others who want to see the Tories out of office.&quot;Meanwhile Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy took a lesson in finger painting at a nursery in Inverclyde.During his visit to the Enchanted Forest nursery in Greenock, he pushed the importance of getting rid of David Cameron and called on voters to help &quot;build a fairer country&quot; by voting for his party.He was joined by the Inverclyde Labour candidate Iain McKenzie on his last full day of campaigning.Mr Murphy said: &quot;It's decision time. Does Scotland want to help get rid of David Cameron, to build a fairer country, abolish exploitative zero-hours contracts, increase the minimum wage, and end Tory austerity?&quot;There's only one way to do that. And that's to vote for Labour.&quot;You can gamble and get rid of Cameron with a vote for the SNP, you can guarantee on getting rid of him with a vote for Labour.&quot;We are determined to help make that happen and make sure Scotland is the fairest nation on earth.&quot;Youngsters sang and made handprint pictures with the East Renfrewshire MP, who added: &quot;This has been an enjoyable campaign in all sorts of different ways.&quot;OK, some people scream and shout and a nationalist rent-a-mob turn up and try and prevent us having a say sometimes, but this is a different type of noise and it's great fun.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

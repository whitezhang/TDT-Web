A Glasgow pensioner who bet &pound;30,000 on a Conservative majority in the general election has yet to collect his &pound;240,000 winnings.
Ladbrokes said there had been no sign of the customer since he placed the wager at odds of 7/1 in a branch in the city centre on 29 April.
Alex Donohue, of Ladbrokes, said the man's forecast had &quot;shown pollsters and pundits the way to do it&quot;.
He said there was never a time limit to collect any winning bet.
But he had thought the pensioner would have made a &quot;beeline&quot; for the bookies as soon as the result was confirmed.
A Glasgow man who bet &pound;30,000 on the Conservatives winning a majority in the general election has pocketed &pound;210,000.
The pensioner made the bet at a city branch of Ladbrokes 10 days before the vote, at odds of seven to one.
Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said the &quot;well-groomed gentleman&quot; was &quot;the biggest winner of the general election&quot;.
He said many punters had backed a hung parliament, and lost out when the Conservatives won a slim majority.

A MOTHER accused of duping her former lover out of knowing he had a child admitted before the birth that he was the only possible dad.
In August 2010, when she was three months pregnant, the woman confirmed to medical staff that the biological father had been her only sexual partner in the previous six months.
The agreed evidence was presented to a jury in a joint minute yesterday, along with confirmation that the woman had twice arranged an abortion at Perth Royal Infirmary but failed to turn up and go through with it.
The 29-year-old woman, from the city, and her 35-year-old gay friend, from Glasgow, are alleged to have made up a series of claims to dupe the father into thinking the child had never been born and deny him his parental rights.
It is alleged that between June 1, 2010, and April 18, 2013, they carried out the fraud at various addresses in Perth.
They deny the charge but it has been agreed in evidence that they both signed the birth certificate and claimed to be the baby’s natural parents.
The girl, who was born in February 2011, is now in the custody of her biological father.
Summing up the Crown case at Perth Sheriff Court yesterday, prosecutor Chris Macintosh said: “You may think we have been hearing something akin to The Jeremy Kyle Show.
“In reality, most of the factual evidence is not in dispute.
“This was a cynical, calculated, selfish and inhumane attempt to get the male accused a child of his own.”
Gareth Jones, defending the mother, admitted his client may have acted “recklessly” but asked the jury to acquit her because she was too “disorganised” to be capable of colluding in such an elaborate scheme deliberately.
Counsel Lucy Keane, defending the mother’s gay friend, said: “His position was that ‘she told me she was pregnant and that I was the father and that I believed her and had no reason to doubt her.’
“He always thought he was the child’s dad.”
The trial continues.

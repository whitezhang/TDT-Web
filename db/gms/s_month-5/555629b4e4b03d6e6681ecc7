A MAN has admitted subjecting SNP politician Humza Yousaf to vile racial abuse in Glasgow city centre.
Christopher Chisholm pleaded guilty at Glasgow’s Sheriff Court to ‘acting in a racially aggravated manner’ towards the Glasgow Central MSP as he sold the Big Issue for charity outside Queen Street Station last year.
A video of the incident shows Chisholm refusing to buy a copy of the magazine from Mr Yousaf, telling him: “You’re not from my country, mate.”
Mr Yousaf - born in Glasgow to a Kenyan mother and a Pakistani father - can be seen telling Chisholm that he was born in Scotland, before Chisholm embarks on a tirade about Romanian and Bulgarian Big Issue sellers.
He can also be heard at one point telling Mr Yousaf: “Charity helps at home.”
The case has been adjourned until June 16, when Chisholm is due to be sentenced.
Following the hearing, Mr Yousaf - the Minister for Europe and International Development - said: “I am delighted with the outcome of this case. It shows that racism will not be tolerated in Scotland.
“When Christopher Chisholm made his racial remarks to me I was selling the Big Issue to raise money for the good work they do, I doubt he would have made these comments had he known I was a Government Minister.
“This highlights the abuse that Big Issue vendors, who are looking for a hand up not a hand out, have to endure on a regular basis.”

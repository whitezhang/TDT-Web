Residents who have made the Bellgrove their home have spoken to the Evening Times about life at the hostel.John Murray, 61, of Calton, has lived at the Bellgrove for more than fourteen years.He said: &quot;It's a long, long time but I'm lucky - I've got a double room with a bed, chest of drawers, a television.&quot;He admits he's an alcoholic and ended up at the Bellgrove after his marriage broke down.He said: &quot;I was drinking litres and litres of vodka. I'm an alcoholic. I'm trying to stay off it because I'm having problems with my kidneys, liver and pancreas.&quot;My children will come and see me with their kids if I'm sober. They've asked me if I want a house but I don't think I'm capable of running a house.&quot;The former boxer said he tries to stay out of trouble but sometimes there are &quot;arguments&quot; amongst the men.He added: &quot;I've taken a few punches but I give as good as I get. The staff will usually wade in and break it up.&quot;Jimmy Donachie, 56, of Bridgeton, has been told by the council that he'd be housed but four years later he's still waiting.&quot;I was told I'd get my own place, away from here. I don't want to be here. I'd rather have my own house.&quot;Lots of people in here are alcoholics. They're killing themselves with it. I've seen seven or eight people die in here in the last four years.&quot;Mr Donachie admits he also has a drink problem and hasn't seen his wife and family for more than twenty years.He recently spent a month in hospital after falling down stairs at the Bellgrove.&quot;My leg was damaged and my kneecap was out,&quot; he said, &quot;I was drinking whisky.&quot;When I'm back to normal I want to get out of here. I'm fed up with staying here.&quot;Mark Davidson, 54, of Maryhill, was only 38 when he first became homeless.He said: &quot;I was on the street for a month then I came into hostels. It was a bit of a come down when I arrived at the Bellgrove.&quot;There are other hostels that are really nice by comparison but there are a lot more rules.&quot;Places like the Bellgrove are the lowest rung of the ladder of British society and there are moves to close down places like this.&quot;But below this rung is living on the street and the rung above this is normal housing so if you close down places like this it makes it a lot harder because you've removed a rung.&quot;Mr Davidson spends most of his time in his room and doesn't join other residents at meal times.He said: &quot;I buy my own food in. I've got no teeth so I can't eat the food in the canteen. Almost all of my meals are sandwiches. I've got a sandwich toaster in my room. Sometimes I get a McDonald's for a bit of variety.&quot;Mr Davidson insists he is &quot;happy&quot; to be living at the Bellgrove and describes the hostel as his &quot;home for me&quot;.&quot;I imagine dying here,&quot; he added, &quot;I've given up.&quot;

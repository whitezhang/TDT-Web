TWO women were cut free from an overturned car after a crash on a busy road.&nbsp;Emergency services rushed to Robyroyston Road in Lenzie, East Dunbartonshire, shortly before 10.25am on Tuesday following reports of a car lying on its side.Firefighters used hydraulic cutting equipment to cut the female driver and her passenger.They received attention from paramedics at the scene before being taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary.Watch Manager Allan Hunter, the Scottish Fire and Rescue incident commander, said it was a &quot;challenging&quot; rescue operation.He said: &quot;The car was lying on its right side, meaning the driver was at the bottom and the passenger was suspended by her seatbelt.&quot;One of our firefighters went inside to provide emergency care while we worked to safely extricate them.&quot;It was a challenging operation due to the position of the car against a raised embankment.&quot;By removing the vehicle's pillars we created a roof flap, which gave ourselves and the paramedics space to lift them out on rescue boards.&quot;

A CHARITY chief has hit out at council plans that could see breakfast clubs axed.Poverty Alliance director Peter Kelly said Glasgow City Council's proposals to reconsider the provision of the vital clubs is a mistake.The charity boss joins parents and opposition councillors in raising concerns about the fact the clubs' futures are even up for debate.Following an 18-day public consultation, the local authority received around 1800 responses and will now prepare a report to be considered by councillors.Four options for the future of the clubs are on the table - either axe them entirely, raise the cost, combine several nearby clubs into one or cut ones which do not have enough children attending, or cost too much to run.Mr Kelly said: &quot;Glasgow City Council has always been at the forefront of trying to provide free meals and breakfast clubs for people for many years.&quot;It's really disappointing that these are the kinds of plans they have on the agenda.&quot;Even more so at a time when we have more people using emergency food aid and foodbanks.&quot;To be looking to take away, from possibly some of the poorest parents, this really vital support for their children is a mistake.&quot;He urged elected members to carefully consider the consultation before voting on any proposals, and added: &quot; They do need to think about whether this is the best way to save money.&quot;We would argue it isn't. If this has an impact on taking food away form poorer children then it isn't something they should be considering doing.&quot;Debbie Baird, single mum from Haghill relies on her six-year-old daughter's breakfast club to feed her in the mornings.The 24-year-old said: &quot;It's disgusting they're even thinking of closing these down or changing it in any way.&quot;I would really struggle to give my daughter breakfast if she didn't go to her local breakfast club. I would find it difficult to afford it.&quot;She also loves going and it has really helped her integrate into school.&quot;SNP councillor David Macdonald, who looks after the Pollok ward, said many parents he has spoken to are worried about the potential changes.He said: &quot;Parents are rightfully angry over these proposals, which most of them believe will see the end of breakfast provision in our school.&quot;We've spent years engaged in a political battle to secure free school lunches for all P1-3 children in Glasgow, so we shouldn't now look to take a step backwards and reduce provision of breakfast clubs.&quot;These clubs are a necessity for some who simply can't afford to feed their children a healthy breakfast and an added bonus for other parents who can safely drop off their kids at school before going to work.&quot;I hope the Labour administration see sense, listen to the majority of parents and scrap their plans to cut this service.&quot;A council spokeswoman said: &quot;The consultation is now closed and we have had a really good response from parents, carers and interested parties.&quot;A report with recommendations will now be compiled for elected member to consider at a committee meeting in the near future.&quot;

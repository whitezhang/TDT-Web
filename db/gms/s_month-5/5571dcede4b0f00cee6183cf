THE ALLEGED killer of Amanda Duffy is set to face fresh prosecution under Double Jeopardy laws.
 
Mechanic Francis Auld, 43, was tried for the 19-year-old’s murder in 1992 but the jury returned a verdict of not proven.
In 1995 Amanda’s parents launched a civil case against Auld.
The judge found him responsible for the death of their daughter and awarded them &pound;50,000 in damages.
Today it was revealed the country’s most senior prosecutor, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC, has applied to the High Court to prosecute Auld again.
This is the third application made by the Lord Advocate under Double Jeopardy legislation.
World’s End murderer Angus Sinclair was convicted last year.
A spokesman for the Crown Office confirmed the move, but refused to comment further as proceedings are now live.

A MOTHER and her gay male friend have been found guilty of duping her former partner out of knowing he had a child.
The 29-year-old woman from Perth and her 35-year-old pal, from Glasgow made up a series of claims to con the biological father into thinking the child had never been born and deny him his parental rights.
They carried out the fraud between June 1 2010, and April 18 2013 at various addresses in Perth.
The jury of 8 women and 7 men took less than an hour to reach the unanimous verdict at Perth Sheriff Court.
Prosecutor Chris Macintosh had earlier told the court: &quot;You may think we have been hearing something akin to The Jeremy Kyle Show.
&quot;This was a cynical, calculated, selfish and inhumane attempt to get the male accused a child of his own.&quot;
The girl, who was born in February 2012, is now in the custody of her biological father.

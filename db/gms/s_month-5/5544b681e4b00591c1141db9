The baby prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne, the Queen's fifth great-grandchild and a spare to the heir - a younger brother or sister for Prince George. Kensington Palace said: &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted at 06.00hrs to St. Mary's Hospital, Paddington, London and is in the early stages of labour.The new baby was born at 8.34am weighing 8lbs 3oz and William was at his wife's side during the delivery.Kate was a number of days overdue and had been taken to the Lindo wing of St Mary's Hospital at 6am from her nearby home Kensington Palace.Kensington Palace said in a statement: &quot;Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was safely delivered of a daughter at 8.34am. The baby weighs 8lbs 3oz.&quot;The Duke of Cambridge was present for the birth.&quot;The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Prince of Wales, The Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry and members of both families have been informed and are delighted with the news.&quot;Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well.&quot;The Duchess of Cambridge's daughter is fourth in line to the throne, the Queen's fifth great-grandchild and a spare to the heir - and Prince George's sister.The Prince of Wales will be overjoyed as he made no secret he wanted his second grandchild to be a girl.Before the birth William and Kate said they did not know the sex of their baby, so the arrival of a daughter will be a surprise to them.Kate's daughter was delivered far quicker then her first child - with the baby being born less than three hours after she was admitted to hospital at 6am in the early stages of labour.George took more than 10 hours to be born but it appears his sister might have taken less then half that time.The Duchess is being looked after by consultant obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who is the surgeon-gynaecologist to the household.He was joined in the delivery room by Alan Farthing, the Queen's surgeon-gynaecologist.

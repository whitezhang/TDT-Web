LOVE-rat footballer Kyle Lafferty has proved his third fiancee is a keeper – by getting her face tattooed on his arm.
The ex-Rangers striker, 27, tweeted a picture of his tattoo of Vanessa Chung next to the photo it was copied from, adding: “Til death do us part.”
It was later retweeted by the 22-year-old model, who he is expected to marry later this year.
A source said: “Kyle and Vanessa are really loved up and this tattoo is proof.
 

“He’s made a few mistakes in his love life in the past but he’s ready to settle down now.”
Lafferty, who is on loan at Turkey’s Caykur Rizespor, was dumped by his wife Nicola Mimnagh, 28, last year after he sent sleazy texts to a chambermaid.

PASSENGERS using Glasgow Central Station - Scotland’s busiest - face potential disruption after the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) today announced an overtime ban over the sacking of a member by ScotRail.
News of the action from next Wednesday comes as the union prepares to decide whether to order a Britain-wide strike in a separate pay dispute with Network Rail.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said affected ScotRail staff at Glasgow Central should not work overtime or rest days from Wednesday, 20 May “until further notice”.
It follows the dismissal of John Lappin by ScotRail, which operates most services from the station. 
Central is the second busiest station outside London with 38 million users a year.
The RMT said it would hold a meeting on Sunday “to continue to build support for this dispute and strengthen our fight to get Brother Lappin reinstated.”
A ScotRail spokeswoman said: “Discussions are ongoing.”
The union is expected to await the results of a strike ballot from the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association on Friday before deciding whether to announce any industrial action.
Any strike would be the first across the rail network for 20 years, before privatisation.

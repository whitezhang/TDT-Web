X Factor winner Alexandra Burke is to be the headline act at this year's BBC Proms in the Park in Glasgow.
Proms in the Park events take place across the UK on 12 September as the BBC celebrates the Last Night at the Royal Albert Hall in London.
Burke will perform with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra under conductor Stephen Bell.
Scotland's Proms in the Park is to take place at Glasgow Green. Tickets go on sale on Friday 15 May.
Donalda MacKinnon, BBC Scotland head of programmes, said: &quot;Audiences are at the heart of everything we do and the Glasgow Proms audience are renowned for creating an atmosphere which makes this one of the most special evenings of the year.&quot;
The first part of the Glasgow Proms will be broadcast live on BBC Two Scotland from 19:15 to 20:30 and will feature on the red button throughout the evening. 
The whole evening will be live on BBC Radio Scotland and streamed online. 
The BBC Proms offer eight weeks of concerts from leading orchestras, conductors and soloists from the UK and around the world.

A FRIEND of one of the men accused of plotting to murder Johnny “Mad Dog” Adair claimed yesterday that police offered him money to become an informer.
Seamus Flynn, 30, bar manager at the Brazen Head in Glasgow, told a jury police offered him “money and a new life” before interviewing him on tape the day after his pal Antoin Duffy was arrested.
Prosecutor Paul Kearney told Flynn he had “misrepresented this exchange about money”. Flynn denied it.
Duffy, 39, Martin Hughes, 36, Paul Sands, 31, and John Gorman, 58, deny conspiring to murder Adair and his fellow former Ulster Freedom Fighters leader Sam “Skelly” McCrory, who now live in Ayrshire.
Duffy and Gorman also deny being part of a plot to kill the governor of Barlinnie jail with a car bomb.
Three other men deny organised crime charges. The trial at the High Court in Glasgow continues.

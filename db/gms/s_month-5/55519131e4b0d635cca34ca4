JIM Murphy has the "overwhelming support" of Labour MSPs as he bids to hold on to the leadership following the disastrous election result.MSPs met in Glasgow for an election post mortem when Mr Murphy gave a debriefing on the campaign and the hugely disappointing outcome.Following the two hour meeting MSPs left the offices in Bath Street, many expressing support others saying nothing.Jackie Baillie, Labour's Finance spokeswoman gave a statement following the meeting.She said the leadership team of Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale had the support of MSPs who had travelled from all over Scotland to attend the meeting.She said: &quot;We had a very positive discussion about the General Election and the significant loss and also about the future and how we need to reconnect with the electorate.&quot;Nobody has any doubt about the scale of the task we face. We are moving forward together.We are moving forward together that very much includes Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale.&quot;We want them at the forefront of that.&quot;She said there was &quot;overwhelming support for both Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale to take us forward&quot;.She did not say the support was unanimous among the MSPs.Mr Murphy's strongest test comes on Saturday when the party's Scottish Executive Committee meets and he is expected to face a motion of no confidence.At least two unions, Unite and Aslef have said he should resign and others including Unison are understood to be meeting this week to discuss their position.Mr Murphy was elected thought the Labour party's electoral college which is split three ways between the affiliated trades unions, elected Members and the party membership.He never enjoyed full backing from the unions who supported his rival for the job, Neil Findlay who resigned his shadow cabinet position at the weekend.Several senior MSPs left the meeting and expressed their support for Mr Murphy while others left without comment.Hugh Henry was the most supportive when asked if Mr Murphy still had his backing he said: &quot;Yes.&quot; And he refused to accept the election defeat was solely down to the leader.He said: &quot;We need to reconnect with people we lost, the people who have walked away from us.&quot;It's not about Jim Murphy it's about the Labour Party all of us.

It is surprising that Jim Murphy should feel he still has a mandate to lead the party after Thursday's results.&quot;I call on Jim Murphy to resign without delay, and give the membership of the Scottish Labour Party the chance to determine their own way forward in rebuilding from Thursday's ruins.&quot;Train drivers union Aslef also urged him to resign.Kevin Lindsay, Scottish organiser, said: &quot;Jim Murphy has just presided over the worst election defeat in the history of the Scottish Labour Party.&quot;He has to go, and he has to go now.&quot;Unison is expected to decide today whether to back Mr Murphy or call for him to resignMr Murphy made no statement after the meeting and left the building by the rear car park.

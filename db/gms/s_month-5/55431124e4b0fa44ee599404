AN exhibition featuring works by leading female artists has opened in the Gallery of Modern Art.It centres round pieces created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Glasgow Women's Library in 2012.The exhibition, called Ripples in the Pond, also includes works which take pride of place in Glasgow Museum's collections, including Kelvingrove Art Gallery.In 2011, Glasgow Women's Library commissioned 21 artists and 21 writers to create new works for an exhibition called 21 Revolutions.It sprang from a desire to promote and celebrate two decades of Scotland's only women's library archive and museum.Ripples in the Pond, which runs until early next year, features 12 works which featured in the earlier exhibition.As well as paintings and drawings, visitors will also be able to enjoy photographs and videos.Glasgow Museums bosses say putting together the works for the GOMA exhibition has allowed staff to learn more about the city's collections and how they related to each other.Glasgow Life chairman Archie Graham said: &quot;Glasgow Women's Library is unique in Scotland and it is entirely appropriate that these works which were created to mark its 21st anniversary have been acquired for Glasgow's unique and globally recognised collection.&quot;Ripples on the Pond will serve as a starting point to understand how these acquisitions relate to works which have previously been in the collection and we will welcome as many contributions as possible to what will surely be a fascinating conversation&quot;.Helen de Main is one of the artists whose work for Glasgow Women's Museums features in the GOMA exhibition.It is inspired by the library's collection of Spare Rib magazines which cover a wide range of feminist and political topics.Notes to EditorsArtists whose work features in Ripples on the Pond include Sam Ainsley, Claire Barclay, Georgina Beier, Vanessa Bell, Kate Davis, Helen de Main, Jacqueline Donachie, Joan Eardley, Karen Guthrie, Ilana Halperin, Barbara Hepworth,Louise Hopkins, Roni Horn, Bet Low, Patricia MacDonald, Mari Mahr, Shauna McMullan, Jacki Parry, Ciara Phillips, Nina Pope, Carol Rhodes, Zineb SediraLucy Skaer, Jo Spence, Corin Sworn, Amanda Thomson, Jane Topping andAlison Watt.Moving Image programme in the projection space (confirmed to date):Corin Sworn, Anne Colvin, Sarah Forrest, Anne-Marie CopestakeModern Edinburgh Film School: Artists in the programme and essay for Affiliate: Thinking Collections (a University of Glasgow programme funded by Creative Scotland)Anne Colvin, Sarah Forrest, Anne-Marie Copestake, Rosalind Nashashibi, Allison Gibbs, Karen Cunningham, Mairi Lafferty, Annabel Nicolson, Lauren Gault, and Catherine StreetRipples on the Pond has been developed with Affiliate: Thinking Collections (a University of Glasgow programme funded by Creative Scotland) and Modern Edinburgh Film School, along with LUX Scotland and Glasgow Women's Library

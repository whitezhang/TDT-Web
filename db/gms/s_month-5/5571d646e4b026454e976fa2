ONE of the rail unions planning strike action over the Bank Holiday has suspended the action after receiving a new pay offer from Network Rail.
Members of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association were due to walk out for 24 hours from 5pm on Monday.
TSSA leaders, and officials from the Rail, Maritime and Transport union have spent the last four days in talks with NR at the conciliation service Acas.
Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA, said: &quot;Our negotiating team at Acas has received a revised offer from Network Rail.
&quot;As a result of this, they have suspended the planned industrial action, pending the outcome of a meeting of our workplace representatives next week.&quot;
NR had been due to mount a legal challenge in the High Court later today against the TSSA's strike ballot.
The RMT, which represents most NR employees, is still to announce if the strike is going ahead.
The breakthrough came as workers, businesses and rail passengers were urged to prepare for the expected travel chaos if the strike by thousands goes ahead.
Rail firms have already cancelled services on Monday and Tuesday and advised passengers not to travel unless the industrial action is called off.

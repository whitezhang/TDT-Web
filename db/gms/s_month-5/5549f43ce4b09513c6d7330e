Does Dumbarton boast the restaurant with the cheapest two-course lunch in the country?
The popular One Up Indian restaurant in the High Street offers a two-course business lunch for just &pound;2.95.
Many people are incredulous when told what they would have to pay for their midday meal. For less than three quid, customers can dine on vegetable pakora followed by a choice of curries with meat or vegetables and rice. The portions arenâ€™t huge but are certainly sufficient for a business lunch.
Proprietor Sonu Singh, who has been running One Up for 10 years now, reckons his business lunch might be the cheapest in Scotland for a sit-down, two-course meal with waiter service.
 Does anyone know of anywhere cheaper for an equivalent lunch? Write to The Editor, Lennox Herald,  1 Central Quay, Glasgow, G3 8DA or email news@lennoxherald.co.uk.

THE mother of a teenage lottery winner has slammed the Crown Office for failing to tell her that a thug who attacked her in her own home had been jailed.
Natasha Stirling, 32, was sentenced to 12 months on Friday at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
But her victim, 44-year-old Linda Restorick, only found out when the Daily Record got in touch with her.
She told us: “I believe the whole system has failed me and I don’t know why I’ve been treated the way I have.
“As the victim, I don’t understand why I wasn’t notified. I’m truly disgusted.”
Linda is also angry about a letter she got from the Crown, dated April 8, which said she no longer needed to go to court to give evidence because her attackers had pled guilty. It was dated April 9.
In fact, only Stirling has been convicted. Co-accused Nicholas Quilietti had his not guilty plea accepted by the Crown.
Linda’s daughter Jane Park, now 19, won &pound;1million on the lottery in 2013.
Thugs burst into Linda’s Edinburgh home in the early hours of December 17 last year, held a knife to her throat, sprayed perfume in her eyes and hit her with a blunt object.
They escaped with valuables and hundreds of pounds in cash. Linda is still suffering the mental trauma of the attack.
 A Crown Office spokeswoman said: “In certain categories of cases, we endeavour to keep victims fully informed of  important developments. 
“In this case, it is regrettable that the victim was not informed in time she was not required to attend at court.”

POLICE Scotland is today back in the firing line over the issue of officers carrying side guns.
It comes after two armed policemen were pictured by the Scottish Daily Mail on Monday morning - casually walking into a Waitrose supermarket in Stirling.
And it appears to go against the promise made by Chief Constable Sir Stephen House that armed officers would only be seen when responding to incidents where there is a threat to life.
The Daily Record has consistently highlighted how armed police were routinely seen on the streets of our cities, including Inverness city centre and Argyle Street in Glasgow city centre.
Before the police U-turn members of the public expressed alarm at the amount of times armed police were seen responding to mundane incidents.

And opposition politicians highlighted how the policy seemed to have been adopted with no consultation.
In October House said:”Althought officers remain effectively with a sidearm, a handgun, when they are out on duty, we are now saying they get deployed only to threats to life.”
Lib Dem Justice spokeswoman Alison McInnes said:”Police Scotland simply have to acrt on their promises.”

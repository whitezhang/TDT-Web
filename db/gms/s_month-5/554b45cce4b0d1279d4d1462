The Wishaw Press this week launched another fantastic competition called Saturday Night Takeaway.
Your favourite local newspaper has teamed up with Mr Chef, Craigneuk Street, Craigneuk, to offer one lucky reader a takeaway meal for two.
The winner will receive from the takeaway specialist a set meal consisting of chicken pakora, two poppadoms, spiced onions plus any special curry chicken or lamb or vegetable bhuna, plus one rice, one naan or two chapatis and two cans of soft drinks.
Mr Chef have been crowned regional winners at the Scottish Curry Awards, Take-away of the Year 2015.
Earlier this year, the Indian takeaway received a Tried And Tasted Award for 2015 – the only restaurant in the ML2 postcode area to do so - and the second year in succession they have won, thanks to votes from satisfied customers.
Wasim Arshad of the long-running family firm behind the establishment’s success.
The Arshads’ first move after buying the premises in November 2012 was to close it down to allow them time to re-brand, recruit a young enthusiastic and bubbly team, update equipment in the premises to the latest models and have extensive marketing materials printed.
All you have to do to win the prize is fill in the coupon in this week's Wishaw Press and send it to: Wishaw Press, Saturday Night Takeaway competition, One Central Quay, Glasgow, G3 8DA, by Monday at 4pm.
Best of luck!

FOOTBALLER Jason Cummings has spoken out about his link to a party where a 15-year-old girl was allegedly filmed having sex.
The Hibs striker described his “nightmare” of discovering on Twitter what is reported to have happened at the Edinburgh flat where he watched a boxing match in the early hours of Sunday.
The Daily Record broke the story on Tuesday but chose not to name the sportsman as we knew he had no involvement in the incident.
 But he has chosen to speak about the abuse he has received online since the alleged incident which happened as he watched the showdown between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao . 
He told The Sun: “It’s got nothing to do with me. It has been a nightmare for me and my family. There was about 50-odd people at the party.
“Me and my mates were there, down the stairs watching the boxing.
“I’m sitting with my mates having a laugh, having a beer or whatever, and then I get dragged into this.
“I only found out when I was getting abuse on Twitter. The police haven’t spoken to me.”
The incident came to light after a video was shared on social media.
Police Scotland revealed an 18-year-old was arrested and charged with a sexual offence but was released pending further inquiries.
A Crown Office spokesman said: “The case remains under consideration.”

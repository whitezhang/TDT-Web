GLASGOW Taxis have scrapped the dreaded boundary charges, they have announced.
But there’s a catch - you have to book them by phone or app.
The friendly, cooperative society voted at its AGM to reduce costs for passengers travelling across any distance around greater Glasgow, including fares to and from Glasgow Airport.
Glasgow Taxis Ltd, which runs two thirds of the cabs in the city, said they wanted to reward customers and remain competitive in the market.
Stephen Flynn, vice chair of Glasgow Taxis Ltd, said: “The removal of the boundary charge for any bookings made by telephone will remove any confusion in this area while adding value and passing on savings to our customers. Fixed prices are easy to understand and provide certainty and reassurance for passengers.
“We want to reward those longstanding, valued individuals and businesses who regularly travel distances with us while also making our overall offering much clearer and simpler for people to understand.
“It’s all part of Glasgow Taxis Ltd’s overall commitment to further improve the service we can offer and we will continue to invest in this area for the benefit of customers.”
Glasgow Taxis introduced credit card payment machines in its 850 vehicles last year and is expanding to contactless payment. Booking apps for iPhones and Android devices have also been part of the modernising of the fleet.
The company is also investing in its members and drivers and is expected to revise its famous Knowledge test to ensure the latest streets and addresses are included within it.
Mr Flynn added: “Everything we do is all part of a bigger picture for our customers. We’re very proud to serve the people of this city and delighted to give something back whether that be through savings, service or charity support.”

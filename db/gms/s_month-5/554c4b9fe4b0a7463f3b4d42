Labour's general election campaign chief Douglas Alexander loses his seat to SNPTwenty year old student Mhairi Black unseated the shadow foreign secretary in Paisley and Renfrewshire South, winning 23,548 votes with a massive 27% swing.Mr Alexander, who had held the seat since 1997 and had a majority of more than 16,000, picked up 17,864 votes.He described it as a &quot;very difficult night&quot; for Labour.In a short speech after the result was declared, Mr Alexander said the opportunity to serve the people of Paisley and Renfrewshire had been a &quot;heavy but joyful&quot; responsibility.He added: &quot;I will always be grateful for having had that opportunity to serve.&quot;I could not be more proud of the campaign that we have fought.&quot;He conceded it had been a &quot;very difficult&quot; night for Labour, saying the Scottish people had chosen not to put their faith in his party.Ms Black said she hoped her rival would have a future in politics after he had recovered from today's defeat.She told supporters at the count: &quot;The people of Scotland are speaking and it's time for their voice to be heard at Westminster.&quot;I make this promise...that is exactly what I plan to do.&quot;Ms Black said her success is down to a change in political participation.She said: &quot;I think it's truly because people have awakened to the fact this Westminster establishment has not been serving them and the Labour party in Scotland has not been serving them, and they must've felt that Douglas Alexander wasn't serving them.&quot;What people are looking for is that change, an end to austerity and the SNP were the only ones offering that.&quot;People are not interested in aesthetic things like age and gender, they're interested in the quality of the argument and I think the SNP is proving tonight that we provided those high quality arguments.&quot;When asked about the reporting of controversial comments she made online before becoming SNP candidate, she said: &quot;I thought it highlighted how little our opponents had to argue against us on if they had to resort to such gutter tactics.&quot;It highlighted that they couldn't challenge us on policy and that's what people were responding to, people are looking for politics to move forward and to be about people rather than politicians' sparring matches.&quot;She was also asked about her comments on a second referendum, saying: &quot;This election, we have continually said is not about independence, it's about making sure the Westminster establishment works to the best it possibly can for Scotland.&quot;When asked how she will celebrate she said: &quot;I'm going to sleep, it's been a long campaign.&quot;And she is confident of another success in her final university exam next week. She said: &quot;It's on Scottish politics, so I have a chance.&quot;

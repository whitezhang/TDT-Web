A RESCUE operation will resume tomorrow to find a hillwalker who has gone missing in the Highlands.
Police in Lochaber are searching the area known as Ring of Steall, in the Mamore mountain range near Fort William for Eric Cyl, 62, who was last seen setting off on Saturday morning.
The search, which started yesterday, has involved both Lochaber and Glencoe mountain rescue teams, backed by Search and Rescue Dogs and a Coastguard helicopter.
Mr Cyl who was walking alone was wearing a light grey jacket and dark trousers and was using two walking poles.
Police Scotland have urged anyone who might have seen Mr Cyl to call 101.

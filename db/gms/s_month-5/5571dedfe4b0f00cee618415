STV’s Sean Batty got into the true swing of things for May 4 with a specially Star Wars themed weather forecast.
Sean managed to keep a straight face as he told viewers he hoped they were having a ‘fantastical galactical afternoon.’
The ever popular weather man then showed images of Planet Hoth, a fictional planet which appeared in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back and has also been a setting in Star Wars books and video games.
He said: “It’s looking a bit cold and snowy and it’s going to be a really chilly day with temperatures ranging from minus twenty to twenty five degrees celsius.”
 

He warned: “If you are planning on going outside to fight the galactic empire make sure you take the scarves and mittens with you.”
Sean then beamed images of the weather on drier two moon desert planet Tatooine where poor locals mostly farm moisture for a living.
He told weather watchers: “On Tatooine its a scorcher of a day here all down to the binary suns. Get the factor fifty looked out.
&quot;If you are planning on going out in Tatooine today be aware as Tuscan raiders have been spotted.”

Sean then finished his stellar report with a visit on to Endor, a small forested moon where the Battle of Endor was held which resulted in the downfall of The Empire.
He said of the weather there that it would be: “Mostly sunny with just a few scattered showers. If you do venture out do look out for the the wee ewoks. They do look cute but are rather vicious sometimes.”
Sean and STV’s special May 4 tribute was just one of many fun stunts which took place on Star Wars day.

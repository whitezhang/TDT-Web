A PROBE has been launched after a man died in police custody hours after being arrested for assaulting an officer.
The unnamed 31-year-old died in a Fife police station after suffering what the Record understands to be a heart attack.
Police have refused to confirm how the man died until a post mortem has been carried out.
The man had been arrested after being spotted walking down a street in Kirkcaldy, Fife, carrying a knife on Saturday night.
A struggle broke out with officers as they attempted to detain him resulting in a female police officer being injured.
Her condition is not known.
A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed that the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner would be launching a full, internal investigation.
The PIRC conducts independent investigations into the most serious incidents involving the police.
Fife Divisional Commander Chief Superintendent Garry McEwan said: “This is a tragic set of circumstances and my condolences go to the man’s family.
“The investigation of deaths in Scotland is the responsibility of Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, who have instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner to lead on this enquiry.”

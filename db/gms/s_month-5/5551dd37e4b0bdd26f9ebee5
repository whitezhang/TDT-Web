ANTHONY STOKES has been ordered before a court again next year over an alleged assault of an Elvis impersonator.
The Celtic and Ireland striker was due for trial this week at Dublin's Circuit Criminal Court but the hearing was put back because there were no judges immediately available to take the case.
The trial over an alleged incident in a nightclub on June 8, 2013 was expected to last two days.
Lawyers for the 26-year-old Dubliner, who has been remanded on bail since last year, initially asked for the case to be put in for mention again in six weeks time.
But Judge Martin Nolan agreed to put it back to January 20 next year.
Father-of-one Stokes appeared in court, dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and purple tie, accompanied by his long-term girlfriend Debbie Lawlor.
The footballer, with an address at Bellhaven Terrace, Glasgow, was arrested by appointment and charged with assault causing harm to Anthony Bradley, 42, at Buck Whaley's nightclub on Leeson Street, Dublin, on June 8, 2013.

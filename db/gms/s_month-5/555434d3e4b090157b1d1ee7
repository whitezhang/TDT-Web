COMMUTERS and shoppers using one of Glasgow's biggest car parks are being left in the dark over its closure.The Buchanan Galleries car park, which will be shut to allow a massive extension of the shopping centre, is to close its doors in two weeks' time, the Evening Times understands.A new facility is not due to reopen until 2017 when the &pound;400million extension is completed.However development bosses are refusing to confirm the date of the closure despite car park staff telling members of the public it will shut on May 31.When asked by the Evening Times, a member of the car park staff said: &quot;May 31 - the shutters will be down.&quot;Fears are also growing for the alternative facilities available for those who currently use the 2000 space multi-storey at the shopping centre.Developers are suggesting drivers use the nearby Concert Square facility which holds 698 cars, as well as others in the city centre.Plans are for Concert Square to become a shopper car park with adjusted tariffs.However SNP MSP Sandra White said the drop in spaces was &quot;deeply concerning&quot; and has demanded more information be given to the public on where else they can go.Ms White said: &quot;The galleries car park with 2000 spaces and the concert square one with 698 is a massive drop.&quot;With the length of time this is going to be closed, it's imperative people coming in to the city centre know exactly where they can park.&quot;Are we going to lose customer to places like Braehead where people know they will get a parking space?&quot;It will be a huge loss to the economy as well - you're talking two years of this, over Christmas as well.&quot;It's a massive blow if they do not confirm the exact date and they do not have the capacity to fill the huge drop in spaces.&quot;Local Labour councillor Philip Braat said he was sure developers &quot;will have all measures in place to counter any short-term loss of these particular parking facilities so that the benefit to the shoppers of the Buchanan Galleries and the wider retail sector will not be diminished.&quot;He added that the party were determined to ensure things remained &quot;business as usual&quot;.Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said h had been informed there would be &quot;sufficient parking spaces in the city centre to provide an alternative&quot; after raising the issue during a council review.Mr Patrick continued: &quot;We await detail of the arrangements that will make that clear to shoppers.&quot;There will obviously be some disruption during the development work, but the sheer scale of investment and jobs involved in the new Buchanan Galleries is a game changer for the city centre.&quot;It will protect Glasgow's position as the UK's leading shopping area outside London's West End.&quot;Kathy Murdoch, Centre Manager for Buchanan Galleries said: &quot;We are progressing our plans for a &pound;400 million extension and enhancement of Buchanan Galleries, which will create 1,500 new jobs in the city.&quot;Our car park will remain open for business for as long as possible whilst we progress enabling works, and we will provide visitors with updates regarding the car park and alternative transport routes in due course.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk

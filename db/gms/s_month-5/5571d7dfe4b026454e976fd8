NEARLY 25,000 people have signed a petition calling for a nightclub to be saved from closure.
They’re demanding Glasgow City Council reverse an order which will effectively see The Arches shut down.
The Licensing Board ruled the famous venue can now no longer operate after Midnight which club bosses say will likely force it to shut entirely.
Councillors and police are blaming a “culture of drug misuse” associated with the city centre site.
But their move has prompted a wave of protest from clubbers and DJs who are backing the Change.org petition.
Tonight the number of signatures stands at just over 23,000.
The petition states: “The Arches is not only Glasgow’s biggest club venue, it is also a world-leading arts venue, presenting and producing world-renowned contemporary performance and nurturing young artists in their early careers.
“The arts operations are largely funded by the income generated from club nights held at the venue and this latest move by Police Scotland and the Glasgow City Council Licensing Board severely threatens a vital part of the Scottish arts ecology, and the livelihoods of the venue’s many employees.
“We, the undersigned, urge Glasgow City Council to re-instate The Arches’ club licence without delay, to allow the venue to continue to make such a vital contribution to Glasgow’s cultural life.”
The nightclub came under fire in March after 26 people were reported for drugs and alcohol-related offences in one night.
A woman also collapsed outside the venue after a dance event was marred by trouble.
Lawyers for the venue argued that almost all of the police complaints stemmed from staff alerting them to drug-taking.

A man who was convicted of physical and sexual abuse against three girls and a boy has been jailed for 12 years.
Robert Fury, 50, first targeted a 10-year-old girl, when he was aged 12, in the 1970s. He later raped a 17-year-old woman in Helensburgh in 1991. 
The High Court in Aberdeen heard he also abused a teenage girl in Dumbarton between 2001 and 2004 and attacked a young boy there between 1995 and 2002. 
Fury was also placed on the sex offenders' register. 
Jailing him, judge Lord Kinclaven told Fury: &quot;You have been found guilty of a serious catalogue of offending. 
&quot;It started at the age of 12 and your last offence was committed when you were 39. 
&quot;The court has to mark the seriousness of your offending.&quot; 
Prior to sentencing, defence QC Brian McConnachie said Fury had not engaged with social workers after being found guilty during an earlier hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
The lawyer said Fury &quot;denies responsibility for his crimes&quot;.

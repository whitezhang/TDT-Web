THE former home of pervert Bay City Rollers boss Tam Paton is on the market for &pound;850,000 — after being torn down and rebuilt.
 The property where Paton died in his hot tub was demolished by developers who built a luxury mansion in its place. 
The Sun reports the five-bedroom property is now being sold with no mention of the shamed mogul who shared the home in Gogar, Edinburgh, with a number of young men.
A source told the paper: “The old house had a really sleazy and sinister history, much like Paton.
“It was only right that it was completely demolished and rebuilt as there was no chance it would have attracted a buyer.”
Obese Paton died of a heart attack six years ago as he took a bath in the home — known as Little Kellerstain — which he’d had built for &pound;29,000 in 1974.
Despite being valued at &pound;1million — with three-quarters of an acre of grounds and landscaped gardens — it wasn’t sold until 2013 when property firm Apex Developments paid &pound;410,000.
Paton oversaw the Rollers’ rise in the 70s. But in 1982 he was jailed for three years for sex assaults on two boys.
In 2004, he was convicted of drug dealing after &pound;26,000 worth of cannabis was found at the mansion — but he was later cleared on appeal.
And in 2007 he was found not guilty of raping the band’s guitarist Pat McGlynn 30 years before.

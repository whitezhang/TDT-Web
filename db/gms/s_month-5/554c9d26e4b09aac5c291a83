Jim Murphy has promised to fight on as Scottish Labour leader after his party was routed by the SNP amid a historic landslide general election victory,
Labour lost 40 seats to the SNP, which took 56 of Scotland's 59 seats and has just one Scottish MP - the same as the Lib Dems and Conservatives.
Mr Murphy, who lost Renfrewshire East to the SNP, said Labour had been &quot;overwhelmed&quot; on a &quot;dreadful night&quot;.
But he said he would stay on as leader and stand for Holyrood in 2016.
Speaking at a news conference in Glasgow, Mr Murphy said Labour had &quot;faced a perfect storm&quot; following last year's Scottish independence referendum.
&quot;Firstly the 'Yes' vote finding a home in one party while the 'No' vote was spread over three,&quot; he said.
&quot;We were hit by two nationalisms - English nationalism, stoked up by David Cameron, and the Scottish nationalism of the SNP.&quot;
Mr Murphy also said Scottish Labour had lacked &quot;continuity of leadership&quot; with &quot;five leaders in just seven short years&quot;.
He said that he and deputy Kezia Dugdale had not had the time to reform the party and were &quot;determined to have a period of stability&quot;.
He said: &quot;We will bounce back, and be the change that working people need&quot;.
Mr Murphy was the biggest casualty of the night for Labour in Scotland.
His once safe majority in Renfrewshire East - a seat he had held for nearly 20 years - was eliminated by the SNP's Kirsten Oswald who swept to victory with 23,564 votes to Labour's 19,295.

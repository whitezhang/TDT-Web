GLASGOW and Scotland full-back Stuart Hogg will be among the most proud in the Warriors camp this weekend when he bids to inspire the team to victory in the Guinness PRO12 Final in Belfast.
Glasgow will face Munster on Saturday at 6.30pm in the new Kingspan Stadium, home to Ulster, aiming to go one better than last year's final and become the first Scottish side to strike major silverware since rugby turned professional in 1995.
However, it could have been very different for the British and Irish Lions full-back who was surprisingly left out of last year's final by head coach Gregor Townsend after he was discovered to have made a secret trip to Belfast to discuss a potential move to Ulster.

 Speaking to the  Daily Record Rugby Show  this week, Hogg admits it was a &quot;mistake&quot; and that he learned a big lesson when frozen out at the Warriors. 
A relative of the late Belfast footballing legend George Best, he explains how he has bounced back stronger and better this season and, now committed to Glasgow to 2017, is eager to prove that Glasgow are the best club in Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Italy - backed by his Ulster family.
Also, in this week's show we hear from Ayrshire's garrulous prop Gordon Reid - who fancies himself as the rugby show presenter - on why he believes that many Ulster fans will turn their allegiance to the Warriors rather than support their bitter rivals from the south of Ireland and help to swing what is expected to be a very tight affair.

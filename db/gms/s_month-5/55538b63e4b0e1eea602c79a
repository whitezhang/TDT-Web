It's unbelievable. I mean I could go and and chap his door right now and we could probably put him in the boot if three of us could manage it, know what I mean, and the police officer replied: &quot;Yes.&quot;The prosecutor also asked: &quot;Do we hear Antoin Duffy say that they need: 'A sawn-off and a revolver as the back up.'&quot; and DS Bryden replied: &quot;Yes.&quot;As the Jeep approaches the street in which McCrory lives, Mr Kearney asked : &quot;Is Sands is heard to say: 'This is the road he walks every single day. You can't go wrong. It is a straight road.&quot; and DS Bryden said: &quot;That's correct.&quot;The prosecutor then asked: &quot;The man they have been talking about has the nickname Skelly,&quot; and the officer said: &quot;Yes.&quot;There is a discussions about cameras at a nearby school and shops.The three speak of the best vantage points to get their target and there is talk of keeping away from a nearby school.Mr Kearney said: &quot;did Mr Duffy say: &quot;I just need a quick look.I almost hit him a couple of years ago.' and DS Bryden replied : &quot;That's correct.&quot;The policeman also agreed that Duffy said: &quot;We'll just drive up to him and f***in jump out and blast him. In his ear.There 's an AK that could possibly be getting made available for us with armour piercing rounds.The thing about that is that's it's too f***in high profile for this first.We want to get the fella out the blue and not have the other running scared.&quot;Mr Kearney asked DS Bryden: &quot;What is an AK,&quot; and he replied: &quot;It's an assault rifle.&quot;At one stage Sands mentions a reference to someone walking along the beach and Duffy asked: &quot;Was he on about this boy here or the Adair,&quot; and is told by Sands: &quot;This boy here.&quot;When asked if that was what was said about this DS Bryden replied: &quot;That's right.&quot;Also during the car journey there is reference to Bobby Sands.DS Bryden said in evidence that he and colleagues had followed the Mercedes Jeep from the Life of Reilly pub in Dixon Avenue, Glasgow, to an address in Ayrshire.He told the court that Hughes was driving, Duffy was in the front passenger seat and that they picked up Sands in Ayrshire.Duffy, 39 - also known as Anton - Hughes, 36, Sands, 31 and John Gorman, 58 , deny conspiring to murder Mr Adair and Mr McCrory - once high profile figures in the loyalist organisation and its military wing the Ulster Freedom Fighters.It is also claimed Duffy and Gorman were allegedly part of a plan to murder the governor of Barlinnie jail Derek McGill in a car bomb attack.Three other men - Craig Convery, 37, Gary Convery, 34, and Gordon Brown, 29, - deny organised crime charges.Under cross-examination by Derek Ogg QC, representing Duffy, DS Bryden accepted that no crime was committed in the tapes.He also agreed there was no suggestion that there were any weapons in the Jeep.DC Bryden agreed that in the tape Duffy spoke of being off his face on Tramadol during the covert recording.Mr Ogg told the court that Duffy had been so sick that he could hardly move or the next three or four days.Ralph Philips, 51, a Loyalist who was transferred from Northern Ireland to Shotts Prison is serving a sentence for murder and conspiracy to murder.He told the court that he met Duffy in prison and discovered he was a Republican who wanted a united Ireland.Mr Philips was asked what Duffy's view of Ira leaders Martin McGuinness and Gerry Adams and said: &quot;He wasn't happy with the peace process and he called them traitors.&quot;The court heard that Mr Philips was friendly with Mr Adair, who visited him in prison.He said when Duffy realised who his victor was he said: &quot;You have a bad dude coming up to see you.&quot;Under cross-examination by Derek Ogg QC Mr Philips admitted that he got on well personally with Duffy and they enjoyed banter together.The trial before Lady Scott continues.

LOUDMOUTH Katie Hopkins will not face any charges over a Twitter outburst that described Scottish people as &quot;little sweaty jocks&quot;.
Police Scotland received a series of complaints when the controversial TV personality tweeted about the transfer of Ebola patient Pauline Cafferkey from Glasgow to London for treatment.
Hopkins wrote: &quot;Glaswegian Ebola patient moved to London's Royal Free Hospital. Not so independent when it matters most are we jocksville?&quot;
She added: &quot;Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn't cricket.&quot;
Thousands of people signed an online petition calling for action to be taken over the &quot;racist tweets&quot; but Police Scotland has said she will face no charges.
A force spokesman said: &quot;An investigation has been carried out and on this occasion no criminality has been established.&quot;
Hopkins' comments came after it emerged that nurse Ms Cafferkey, who volunteered to help in the fight against Ebola, was diagnosed with the deadly virus on her return to Glasgow from Sierra Leone at the end of last year.
She received specialist treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in north London and has since made a full recovery.

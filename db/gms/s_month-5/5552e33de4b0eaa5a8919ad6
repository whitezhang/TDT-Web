A FORMER bus parking area in Glasgow's East End is to be transformed into a new community park.The Camlachie Community Park has undergone its first stage of development after having a landscape makeover and the next phase of work will create a skate park, bouldering facility and a natural play and adventure area.The new park at Barrowfield Gardens, which is less than 600 yards from The Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, received &pound;156,000 of funding from the Central Scotland Green Network (CSGN) who transform derelict land into woodland cover and recreational opportunities.The project is a partnership between Glasgow City Council, West of Scotland Housing Association, Forestry Commission Scotland and the local community.The funding was announced yesterday morning by Environment Minister Dr Aileen McLeod, during a visit to launch the new community park which is due to be completed by the end of the year.Dr McLeod said:&quot;In total, around &pound;510,500 of greenspace funding through the CSGN Development Fund will go towards 13 different greenspace projects across the central belt.&quot;The long-term aim of the funding is to kick-start a transformation to make the central belt a better place to live and work within, by delivering a high quality environment for everybody.&quot;The Camlachie Community Park is a great example of this. By working in partnership, all those involved are taking a piece of unused derelict land and creating a brilliant area of greenspace for local people to enjoy.&quot;Children from the nearby St Anne's Primary School were at the launch of the project and were excited to hear of the activities the park will bring.Dr McLeod continued: &quot;The children have been very excited. I met with with some of the kids at St Anne's Primary School and they are really looking forward to the skate park and bouldering.The project is one of 20 Commonwealth Games Greener Legacy Projects, being close to venues such as Celtic Park and the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. It also creates a greenspace link to Forestry Commission Scotland's flagship woodland park being built at Cuningar Loop, just opposite the former Athlete's Village.Sasha Laing, Policy and Development Officer for the Forestry Commission, was at the project launch. She said: &quot;We want to make sure that this derelict land is used by the community and to help people become more engaged with the green spaces and live more healthy lifestyles.Depute Leader of Glasgow City Council, Councillor Archie Graham, said:&quot;As one of the council's leading legacy projects I'm pleased to see this site come off our vacant and derelict land register and be turned into a vibrant, green and useable space. It's a real asset to the area and the community, which of course they helped shape, and I look forward to seeing it progress further over the next couple of years with the creation of the play areas and wildlife habitat.Keith Geddes, Chair of the CSGN, added:&quot;The CSGN Development Funding will ensure we continue to make a considerable contribution to projects like Camlachie Community Park, which is revitalising vacant and derelict land into a valuable greenspace resource. The Fund will also support projects which are enhancing access routes for the benefit of local and disadvantaged communities, businesses and the environment.&quot;The funding for the CSGN Development Fund 2015-16 has been made available through Forestry Commission Scotland and Transport Scotland.

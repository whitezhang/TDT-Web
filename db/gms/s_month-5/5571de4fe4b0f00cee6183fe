THE wreckage of a light aircraft which crashed during a short flight from Inverness to Dundee at the weekend is to be removed.
Bad weather in the area yesterday had hampered attempts to remove the twin-engine Beechcraft 55 Baron, which broke up when it slammed into a hillside.
Andy Thomson, 37, and Dingwall garage owner John McKinnon, 53, died when the plane came down near the Perthshire village of Abernyte on Sunday.
Commercial pilot Andy, who was a first officer with Jet2, had flown two businessmen to a football match in Manchester the day before the tragedy.
Yesterday, Bennett, of Inverness firm Cairngorm Group, said he and Orion Group chairman Savage were shocked at the tragedy.
He added: “We were both devastated to hear it was Andy Thompson who was in the crash.
“Our thoughts are with both families.”
An Air Accidents Investigation Branch team are examining the wreckage for clues about what caused the tragedy.

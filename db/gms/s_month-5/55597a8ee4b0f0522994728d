RESTORATION work has started on one of Glasgow's most famous buildings.Work to restore the clock tower at the Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA) is now underway and is expected to last until late autumn or early winter.The &pound;400,000 restoration work will focus on the clock and weather vane which will be cleaned, restored and replaced where necessary.A spokesman for Glasgow Life said: &quot;We're focusing on repairs to the fabric of the clock as well as stone repairs to the tower and repointing of the mortar.&quot;There won't be any closures and it will largely go unnoticed.Councillor Archie Graham, Chair of Glasgow Life said: &quot;The Gallery of Modern Art is a building firmly tied to the history of Glasgow itself.&quot;This refurbishment will return the clock tower to its former glory just in time for its 200th anniversary and give generations to come the chance to enjoy the building in full.&quot;In the meantime the Gallery of Modern Art remains open to the public displaying Glasgow's impressive modern art collection through exhibitions such as Ripples on the Pond and Ballet of the Palette.&quot;Visitor numbers to the GoMA increased by 8.8% last year thanks to the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. The increase meant that the museum was ranked in the top ten most visited attractions in Scotland.A new exhibition featuring works by leading female artists opened earlier this month and is due to run until early next year.The exhibition, called Ripples in the Pond, centres round pieces created to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Glasgow Women's Library in 2012. It includes paintings, drawings, photographs and videos.The Royal Exchange Square building was originally constructed in 1778 as the townhouse of William Cunninghame of Lainshaw, one of Glasgow's wealthy tobacco lords. It later became a bank in 1816 -17 when it was enlarged to create the Royal Exchange.It was this work which added the Corinthian pillars of the temple frontage to Queen Street and the Cupola and clock tower design. The Royal Exchange was later purchased by Glasgow Corporation in November 1949 for &pound;105,000

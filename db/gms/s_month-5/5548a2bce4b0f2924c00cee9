A FAKE soldier used a photo of a real war hero from a book to dupe the Royal British Legion into thinking he was an injured veteran.
James Heron O’Hara sent the charity a shot of an Australian army dog handler wearing a face veil and dark goggles to convince them he was an ex-Royal Marine Commando who was shot in Iraq.
 The photo is believed to show Sergeant John Cannon and his explosive detection dog Storm in the  war zone in 2008. 
Yesterday, we exposed 42-year-old Walter Mitty character O’Hara for posing as a veteran to trick his way into a major Legion fundraising campaign. He told them he served with the Royal Marines in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Iraq.
 

O’Hara, from Cathcart, Glasgow, sent two photos he said were of himself – a grainy shot of a soldier in a green beret and the picture of the uniformed man and his dog.
But we spotted the second image on the cover of Australian War Dogs – The Story of Four-Legged Diggers by Nigel Allsopp.
And while Sgt Cannon and Storm saved dozens of lives in eight years supporting special forces units, O’Hara is a part-time actor whose Facebook page is littered with links to drug websites.
 

His profile page says he works offshore and there were “military units and weapons” in his past.
A Ministry of Defence source said no one with O’Hara’s details had ever served in the Royal Marines or Reserves. When we spoke to him, he claimed he had served under a different name – but he refused to say what it was.

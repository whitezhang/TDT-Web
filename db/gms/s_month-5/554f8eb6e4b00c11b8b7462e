THE 2015 Race for Life has taken place in Glasgow today, bringing together thousands of women in the fight against cancer.
The annual race, to raise money for Cancer Research UK, started out in the city's Saltmarket and finished at Glasgow Green.
A crowd of around 10,000 women turned the streets pink after being rallied by emotional Olympic Curling star Eve Muirhead who helped to launch the event.

Eve, 25, who lost both her grandmothers to cancer, said: “I know what it’s like to lose a loved one through such a horrible disease and so many of the people I’ll meet on Race for Life day will also have been through it.”
The Glasgow event is the UK's largest Race for Life continues to grow every year.

THE cousin of the man accused of murdering Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll spoke to him on the phone after he allegedly fled to Spain, a court heard yesterday.
Detective Sergeant Colin McKenzie said he took a statement from Karen O’Donnell, who claimed she talked to William Paterson.
The officer was giving evidence at the trial of Paterson, who allegedly shot Carroll, 29, in the car park at Asda in Glasgow’s Robroyston on January 13, 2010.
The 35-year-old is also accused of attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
The indictment claims that on January 23, 2010, he flew from Glasgow to Malaga “to avoid arrest, prosecution and conviction”.
The court heard O’Donnell told police in May 2010: “I last spoke to my cousin Billy about three weeks ago when I called him up.
“He said he was doing fine. He is either in Marbella or Malaga.”
In earlier evidence, O’Donnell told the jury she didn’t say that to police.
Paterson denies the charges and has incriminated six other people.
The trial continues.

THE hit-and-run heroin addict who mowed down and killed little Sophie Brannan has been jailed for more than 12 years.
Christopher Hannah, 33, mounted the pavement and smashed into 11-year-old Sophie while high on drugs and driving “like a madman” in Maryhill, Glasgow.
He also left her 10-year-old friend and the friend’s 36-year-old uncle badly hurt in November last year.
Dad-of-three Hannah previously pled guilty to a string of charges over the horror, including the culpable homicide of Sophie.
 

Lord Bannatyne jailed Hannah for 12 years and three months and banned him from driving for life at the High Court in Livingston today.
He said the lives of Sophie's family had been &quot;shattered&quot;.

PEOPLE in long-term unemployment are heading back to the world of work as part of the team behind the new Marks and Spencer Glasgow store.Many of the 250 jobs that have been created by the new Glasgow Fort store opening will go to East End residents, helping to fulfil the M&amp;S promise of providing local jobs for local people.Susan Wiggins, who lives next to the shopping centre, is just one of the new retail workers who will be behind the scenes of the 80,000 sq ft store when it opens on Thursday May 21 and she 'cannot wait' for the chance to be back at work after a more than 15-year-long gap.The 60-year-old said: &quot;I just felt it was time to get back into the workplace.&quot;I have not worked for 16 years, so it has been a long time.&quot;It has been an experience, it has been really hard but I have loved it - the staff are fabulous.&quot;I am looking forward to being in routine and a working environment and obviously having the money.&quot;I am most looking forward to the store opening though, because we are all a new team that has come together here and I think it will be great for all of us.&quot;I will be working through the back of the store, making sure all the stock levels are correct and things like that - it is very interesting learning it all.&quot;Marks and Spencer have been absolutely brilliant, they have not made me feel any different from anyone else even though I have not worked in a store before. &quot;Many of the stores new employees will have come from the company's employability scheme, Make Your Mark, which works alongside the Princes Trust to train and mentor young people in developing the skills and confidence they need to find a job.Alex Main, 23, was one of the hopefuls who signed up for the programme 15 months ago and was placed in the Sauchiehall Street store's clothing department, before making the move to the new store.Mr Main, from Possilpark, said: &quot;When I was at the job centre they recommended it to me and I thought it was worth a shot as opposed to a regular job search because I was not having any luck with that.&quot;Now, I am moving to the home department and I am excited and nervous at the same time.&quot;I have never worked in this sort of department before so I will have to brush up my knowledge a bit which I am quite looking forward to because I like to be able to broaden my knowledge.&quot;Store Manager, Kirsty Warwick, said: &quot;We have been inundated with applications and we are delighted to have been able to recruit such a large number of people from the surrounding area.&quot;Our new staff members are already in training and it's safe to say that we can't wait until launch.&quot;Phil Goodman, Centre Manager at Glasgow Fort, said: &quot;We are committed to supporting the local community and economy wherever possible so wholeheartedly welcome M&amp;S's efforts with partner agencies to supply significant employment to those living in and around Easterhouse.The flagship store will feature an in-store bakery, a food ordering service, a 200-seat caf&Atilde;&copy; and the popular Shop Your Way service, which allows customers the choice to order an item from the M&amp;S catalogue in-store or online with free next day in-store delivery and collection.

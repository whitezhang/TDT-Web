RANGERS will give Hibs just 950 tickets if they face each other in a play-off showdown at Ibrox.
Queen of the South, however, will hand over 2,900 briefs.
The Easter Road club will find out on Sunday who they’ll face in the Premiership semi-final play-off, with Rangers leading Queens 2-1 from the first leg.
But if it’s Rangers they’ll receive less than TWO per cent of the Ibrox capacity.

And if James Fowler’s side are their opponents, the Hibees will land 33 per cent of the Palmerston capacity.
Hibs fans have taken to Twitter to hit out at the Glasgow club’s move. The Easter Road club are using their Loyalty Scheme to allocate the tickets and fans wishing a ticket for Ibrox must have accrued 180 points to be eligible.

A RETURNING Conservative MP giggled like a schoolboy after one disgruntled voter drew a penis next to his name on their ballot slip – only for the vote to then count.
Glyn Davies easily held onto the Montgomeryshire constituency in mid Wales after being chosen by 45 per cent of the voters.
And the 71-year-old said the victory was made all the more sweeter after saying nearest rivals the Liberal Democrats had thrown the &quot;kitchen sink&quot; at their campaign.

However, the former assembly member – who has successfully battled colon cancer – said one of the more memorable events of the night was down to one person's bizarre attempt to spoil their ballot papers.
Mr Davies wrote on his Facebook page: &quot;One voter decided to draw a detailed representation of a penis instead of a cross in my box on one ballot paper.

&quot;Amazingly, because it was neatly drawn within the confines of the box the returning officer deemed it a valid vote. I'm not sure the artist meant it to count, but I am grateful.
&quot;If I knew who it was, I would like to thank him (or her) personally.&quot;

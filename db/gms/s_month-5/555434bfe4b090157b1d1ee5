PEOPLE living in Langside will next week be able to find out what is happening on their doorstep.The city council's Langside area partnership will meet in Queen's Park Football Club on Tuesday as part of a move to hold more meetings in the communities they serve.The meeting, which will start at 1pm, is usually held in the City Chambers but it is hoped moving it into the community will encourage the public to attend and increase transparency.The area partnership aims to support the neighbourhoods of Battlefield, Camphill, Langside, Mount Florida, Cathcart and King's Park.It also works in partnership with neighbouring areas to contribute towards project like the Shawlands Town Centre Action Plan.The meeting agenda will include an economic impact assessment of Battlefield and Mount Florida High Street, an update on the Shawlands Town Centre Action Plan, a presentation from Queen's Park Football Club on their community work, and the consideration of small grant funding to local projects through the Langside Area Budget.Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of the Langside Area Partnership , said &quot;The purpose of having these meetings out of the City Chambers is to raise awareness among the public of both local and city-wide issues of importance to residents and their communities.&quot;Each meeting will provide an opportunity for the Area Partnership to engage with communities, learn more about local initiatives and meet a range of community stakeholders.&quot;

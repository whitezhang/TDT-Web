British Transport Police want to trace a woman who attacked a female passenger at Paisley Gilmour Street station.
The suspect verbally abused a couple after they bumped into each other at about 12:10 on Saturday.
She followed them to platform three and pushed the 32-year-old victim, who suffered a cut to her hand. 
The woman is described as about 5ft 6in tall, with wavy ginger hair tied up in a bun. She was wearing a green canvas jacket and dark blue jeans.
British Transport Police (BTP) said the woman pushed the victim as she attempted to board a train and made off from the station following the attack.
Officers are reviewing CCTV images from the train and the station in an attempt to identify her.
BTP said the victim boarded the 11:36 Ardrossan Harbour to Glasgow Central service and later reported the attack.
PC Patrick Moran said: &quot;This was an unnecessary and unwarranted assault which left the victim shaken. 
&quot;The train's only stop after Paisley Gilmour Street was Glasgow Central and it would have been busy with other passengers. 
&quot;I am appealing for anyone who was on that service or at the station and can provide information which can help identify the suspect to get in touch with BTP urgently.&quot;

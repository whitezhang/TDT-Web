A SCOTS filmmaker behind the smash hit series of viral videos ‘Ryan Gosling Won’t Eat His Cereal’ has died of bone cancer aged 27.
Ryan McHenry, who was from Dumfries and who moved to Edinburgh when he was 18, had been battling the disease since 2013.
He announced that he had won his cancer fight last July but sadly the disease returned. He died on Sunday.
Ryan was famous for creating the world-famous internet meme that saw the movie star Gosling simply refuse to eat cereal.
 

The clips on social media site Vine – where he had more than 200,000 followers – have been viewed millions of times, while a compilation has more than 2 million hits on YouTube.
They proved so popular that Gosling even responded to them in a recent interview.
In one of his final posts on Twitter on Friday, Ryan displayed his typical deadpan humour. He wrote: “Yesterday was my 10,000th day alive on this Earth and not one of you got me a card or anything...”
Vine’s official account paid tribute to the filmmaker. It said: “Your creativity brightened many lives. Thank you. You’ll be missed.”
Burnistoun star Robert Florence also honoured Ryan, tweeting: “Ryan Gosling, eat your cereal. Goodnight. Love will win.”

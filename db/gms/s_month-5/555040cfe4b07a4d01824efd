WOMEN in Glasgow are having to go without essential sanitary products because they cannot afford to buy them.Drumchapel Foodbank is raising money to buy sanitary towels that can be given out to users, along with emergency food packages.Organisers said they were receiving requests from women for sanitary towels and tampons because they were unable to buy the products.It has led to a call for sanitary products to be made available to women who cannot afford them.The foodbank, which is in its second year, helped 770 people - including children - from February 2014 until the end of March this year.Just under half - 47% - of their users are female.Oonagh Brown, foodbank development worker, said the campaign began due to &quot;widespread demand&quot;.They hoped to raise &pound;500 to buy at least 125 large packets of sanitary towels.However, in 14 days they have raised more than &pound;625 and are still taking more donations.Oonagh said: &quot;Sanitary items are extremely important to the women who attend the Drumchapel Foodbank as they are a necessity.&quot;Without them many women are forced to make their own and there are feelings of shame and discomfort for many associated with this.&quot;Liz Atkinson, manager of Kingsridge Cleddans Economic Development Group, which runs the foodbank, said: &quot;We really pleased that we have already managed to make &pound;625 for our female hygiene fund.&quot;Eleanor Macleod, foodbank volunteer added: &quot;We would like to ask people to keep donating to this project.&quot;In the last few months we have been struggling to keep up with the high demand for this service and need donations of both food and hygiene items to continue to support people in the local and wider community.&quot;Oonagh called for action to make sure women did not have to go without vital hygiene products when menstruating.She said: &quot;If people are in a financial crisis there should be something put in place where female hygiene products should be made readily available so women don't need to go without them.&quot;In just over a year the foodbank gave out more than 1100 seven day food parcels.The foodbank managers are also trying to address fuel poverty in the area.Oonagh said: &quot;That's obviously a major problem because people can't cook their food without gas or electricity.&quot;To donate visit http://www.gofundme.com/drumchapelfoodbank or contact Oonagh on 0141 944 3335.The foodbank is also looking for food donations.

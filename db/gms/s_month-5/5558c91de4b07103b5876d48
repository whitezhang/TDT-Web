 GLASGOW'S international stand-off Finn Russell spoke exclusively to the Daily Record Rugby Show after his 'Man of the Match' performance steered the Warriors to a 32-10 victory over Ulster and to a first-ever top spot at the end of the Guinness PRO12 Championship. 
But the youngster admitted that the Scots will face a stronger Irish team when the pair meet again, now in the semi-final back at Scotstoun on Friday night.
&quot;It was great to win and finish top because that gives you a lot of confidence,&quot; he said, &quot;and it was important to get a home semi-final because history shows that no team has won it after being away in the semis.
&quot;But we know that Ulster rested a lot of players and will be different next week so we will need to tighten up our game and we'll need the fans to get behind us again if we're to reach the final and win this trophy for the first time.&quot;
 Russell was one of the stars of the show, his two tries following a stunner by Stuart Hogg and helping to turn around a 10-6 half-time deficit and speed Glasgow on to the bonus point thanks to Richie Vernon's late score that enabled them to pip Ospreys at the top of the table. That Vernon score secured the home tie in the last four as close rivals Munster and Ospreys also won. 
In the latest Rugby Show, Russell explains how they did it, what has to change when Ulster roll out the star names and what he expects from Glasgow in Friday's semi-final.

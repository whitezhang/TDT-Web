 

Ah election day, twas the most exciting day of the year for humans...not so much for our dogs!
Probably the best thing to come out of election day so far has been the joyous twitter hashtag #DogsAtPollingStations.
 
It appears that dogs kept turning up to polling stations trying to vote. 
Silly puppy, you don't have opposable thumbs!
We've said it before and we'll say it again, dogs aren't allowed to participate in elections. Even if we really, really, really, really want them to. Every vote counts, right?

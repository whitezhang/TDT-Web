A FAMILY are continuing their dad's fight for justice after he died of asbestosis before his case went to court.The daughters and son-in-law of Bill Murray, from Paisley, are hoping to find anyone who worked with the &quot;caring, family man&quot; in Bishopton's Royal Ordnance Factory.Bill, who was diagnosed with the chronic lung condition two months before he died, started a legal challenge against the operators of the factory - a private owner and the British Government.The 84-year-old grandad-of-six claimed he was exposed to the deadly asbestos fibres during his 40-year long service at the site and started pursuing both owners for compensation.Bill's son-in-law Hugh Kirkwood and his wife Elizabeth have now taken on the legal battle to raise awareness of the debilitating condition and get justice for Bill.They are hoping to further strengthen their legal challenge by reaching out to those who remember working with the grandfather-of-six at the explosives factory.Hugh, 62, said: &quot;I don't want to see anybody else suffering the way I saw Bill suffering, he really suffered so badly with it.&quot;My wife breaks down most of the times she is speaking about it. It was so debilitating.&quot;There is no walking about. He couldn't climb the stairs to his house - 13 stairs - and he couldn't get up to them to go to bed,. It would take him half an hour.&quot;It was a terrible way to see him. He got oxygen at the end but ultimately he went into hospital and couldn't come back out.&quot;I could see the illness working on him before he was diagnosed. He knew there was something wrong.&quot; When he got the diagnosis it was very quickly after he passed.&quot;If anybody knew Bill and worked in these places where these fibres were, they need to get in contact with doctors.&quot;This thing lies dormant for 20-30 years and it only takes one fibre to attach to your lung.&quot;It's like a bit of metal pitted by rust... It's a disgusting disease.&quot;While working in the factory, the avid fisherman and nature lover had several jobs including acting as the fire fighter on site.If a blaze broke out in one of the rooms or due to faulty equipment, he would be the one to put it out and make sure everyone was safe.&quot;He was very fit and healthy, he had a bypass operation and walked the West Highland way after that.&quot; said Hugh.&quot;He loved nature too, and knew all the Latin names for flowers and things.&quot;It really killed him when he started getting ill as he couldn't really go out and do the things he loved to do.&quot;Caitlyn MacCabe from Thompsons Solicitors in Glasgow, is pursuing the case on behalf of Mr Murray's family.She said &quot;In a case like this help from the public is very important as the big insurance companies will try lots of different legal manoeuvres to deny compensation to families who've lost loved ones to asbestos.&quot;If anyone used to work with Mr Murray at the factory in Bishopton then they should contact me at the Thompsons office in Glasgow straight away.&quot;It's this kind of help from a former colleague of Mr Murray that could really help his family finally get justice.&quot;A spokesman for Simpson and Marwick, the legal firm representing the factory owners, said: &quot;As Simpson &amp; Marwick are representatives in this case which is currently still ongoing, we cannot provide comment at this time due to our legal obligations.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.ukThe 83-year-old had worked at the site for 40 years, from 1952 to 1992,The facility was originally run by the governmentNow his family are continuing the case following Bill's death and are appealing for anyone who worked in the factory with him to get in touch.They are hoping it will strengthen their legal challenge against the factory operators.Bill's son-in-law Hugh Kirkwood, said: &quot;Mr Murray worked at the ROF from 1952 to 1987, during government ownership, and then also under private ownership from 1987 to 1992. He was diagnosed around October/November 2011 and died on 14 January 2012 (age 84).

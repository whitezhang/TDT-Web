DONATIONS have been made in memory of an eight-year-old boy who died when he was crushed by a gravestone.Just a day after the death of Ciaran Williamson at Craigton Cemetery, in Cardonald, it emerged that family friends and passers-by had been giving memorial donations to the lollipop lady at Lourdes Primary, where Ciaran was a pupil.He died in Yorkhill hospital after a six foot tombstone crashed over on Tuesday night, just seconds after Ciaran and four friends had gone in through a hole in the wall.They had started to climb a tree and jump on the stone before it fell to the ground, striking Ciaran on the forehead.A 10-year-old boy was still in hospital yesterday with serious injuries.The Health and Safety Executive has confirmed they are investigating the incident, together with the police.A city council spokeswoman said the donations - which were given the lollipop lady yesterday - would be passed to the family. She said the school was planning to hold a memorial but no details had been finalised.She stressed that any event would take place with the family's consent.Meanwhile, it was revealed that Ciaran's family had previously told him not to go in to the cemetery.Ciaran's devoted aunt Cody Griffin, set up a memorial page on Facebook 'in memory of Ciaran James Williamson.'Posting on the page she said: &quot;Just wished you would have listened to us all not to go in the graveyard but boys will be boys.&quot;Nothing can describe the pain I'm feeling without you here. We had some bond and it'll never be forgotten or broken. You were amazing. You were the best nephew ever and I am the luckiest auntie to have had you as mine/still have you as mine.&quot;In an emotional post, she said Ciaran had been taken &quot;too young, away from all your family and friends that love you with all our hearts.&quot;She said he was the 'talk of the street' and his pals had 'done you proud.'Flowers, teddies and a Celtic football shirt have been piling up around the railings outside his flat in Moss Heights Avenue with messages of support for the family.Ciaran's father Ryan Williamson said he loved him &quot;to the moon and back&quot; and he would be in his family's hearts forever.Ciaran's uncle Ross Williamson said he had done &quot;the hardest thing I will ever have to do. I had to say goodbye to one of the most amazing special little boys in the world. He was taken far too soon. You will be forever remembered, love you so much.&quot;A section of the cemetery, which backs onto the tower block where Ciaran lived, remained sectioned off by police yesterday as inquiries continued.As reported in yesterday's Evening Times, there have been calls for the council to flatten the gravestones, some of which have been described as insecure by locals.A spokeswoman for Glasgow City Council said members of the public were still able to visit graves, apart from the section that remains cordoned off by police.There was no information yesterday on when the cordon would be taken down.The council spokeswoman said the cemetery was rarely used for new burials, with around five a year taking place.

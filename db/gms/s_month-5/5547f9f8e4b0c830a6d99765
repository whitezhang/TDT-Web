IF YOU'VE just woken up then May the 4th be with you - it's Star Wars Day .
To celebrate the fact, a batallion of Galactic Empire Stormtroopers descended on Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow and Union Square in Aberdeen today to join in the celebrations in style.
It's a long flight back to the Death Star so the troupe of troopers were spotted all over - shopping, dining and chatting with shoppers - and generally enjoying some down time from the trials of threating the galaxy with mortal peril.
 

The white-masked enforcers even managed to squeeze in a movie at Union Squareâ€™s Cineworld and a spot of lunch at YO! Sushi Silverburn.
One bemused shopper commented, &quot;I'm a massive Star Wars fan, so it was really cool to see the Stormtroopers up close in their full armor. They were just going about their own business and checking out the shops, it was quite surreal!&quot;
Lynne Butler, Marketing Manager at Silverburn said: &quot;It's a big year for Stormtroopers with the release of Star Wars: Episode VII, so we are glad that we could provide some sanctuary away from the hype and help them celebrate May 4 in style.
 

&quot;We hope they enjoyed their day out and look forward to welcoming them back soon. May the 4th be with you!&quot;
If you spot any Stormtroopers on your travels today, please inform your local Rebel Alliance base.

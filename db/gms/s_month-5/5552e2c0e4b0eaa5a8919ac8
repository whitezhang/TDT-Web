JIM Murphy's leadership of Scottish Labour is under pressure after the first MSP to break ranks has called for his resignation.Mr Murphy is expected to face a no confidence motion at the party's ruling Scottish Executive committee on Saturday.If the motion is passed it doesn't require Mr Murphy to resign but would leave him in an even more difficult position.He received a boost when it was stated the &quot;overwhelming majority&quot; of MSPs supported him and Kezia Dugdale continuing to lead the party.However Labour sources say the level of support expressed was a surprise with many who voted for him in the leadership contest thought to now be uneasy with an unelected leader, following his defeat to the SNP in East Renfrewshire.Alex Rowley MSP has written to all his Holyrood colleagues and Mr Murphy calling for him to go.Mr Rowley, who backed Neil Findlay for the leaders post last year said he was resigning from the Labour shadow cabinet team and said Mr Murphy and his team including Chief of Staff John McTernan should go.He said: &quot;I sincerely hold the view that you continuing as leader whilst not in the Scottish Parliament, and not in an elected position holding a democratic mandate, means you will become an unhelpful distraction from the real issues that Scottish Labour must focus on.&quot;Mr Rowley praised Mr Murphy's dedication and hard work during the campaign but said change was now needed.Mr Rowley was one of the First MSPs to leave the meeting in Glasgow this week but he declined to comment at the time.In the letter he said: &quot;I have given that a lot of thought and consideration and I concluded that it would be disloyal and damaging to Labour were I not to speak out. I believe now, more than ever, that we in Scotland need a strong relevant Labour Party and we will not achieve this under your leadership therefore I have no choice but to speak out.&quot;Unite and Sale unions have already called for Mr Murphy to go and are expected to vote in favour of any no confidence motionUnison officials met yesterday to discuss the election campaign in what was described as a planned meeting.A Unison official said there was no movement within the union to oust Mr Murphy, but it was no secret Mr Murphy is not their choice of leader.He said: &quot;People know which way Unison voted in the leadership.On Mr Murphy being forced to resign he added: &quot;We are not the ones to be calling for it.&quot;

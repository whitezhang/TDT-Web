EVER since he returned to Scotland from French and South African rugby, Gregor Townsend has dreamt of being part of a Scottish team going for gold in front of a 10,000 crowd.
The SRU struggled for more than a decade to successfully launch professional rugby in Scotland, and Townsend was furious when the union scrapped the Border Reivers team with which he ended his career in 2007.
In this exclusive Daily Record Rugby Show, he admits that he wondered whether he would ever see the day that a Scottish pro side would attract a good crowd and pays tribute to the Glasgow players for turning that dream into a reality.
Named this week the Guinness PRO12's 'Coach of the Season', Townsend has steered his side to the play-offs in each of his three years as head coach but after being denied in the semi-finals in his first term and beaten in the final by Leinster last year, he is determined to see his side go one step further and win the title this time around.
He speaks of Ulster's changed side and how he has heard of the Irishmen being tipped to become the first to win a semi-final away from home, but insists that he believes his team - even without the likes of Mark Bennett, Alex Dunbar, Sean Maitland and Tim Swinson - have enough quality driven on by a partisan home crowd to clinch victory tonight.

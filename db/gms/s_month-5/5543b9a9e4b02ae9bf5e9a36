A HOME carer is set for a slice of the Big Apple after scooping nearly Â£200,000 on the lottery.Fifty-seven-year-old Anita Reid, from Blantyre, is planning a &quot;long overdue&quot; trip to New York, to pay off her mortgage and get a new car after winning &pound;186,128.50 on the EuroMillions draw.The mum-of-two, who works for South Lanarkshire council, said she couldn't believe her luck when her numbers came up on Tuesday.She said: &quot;I sat in the living room and checked my numbers on Teletext as usual, to see whether I'd won anything. I thought 'oh, I've got one number, oh two, then three, four, five and a Lucky Star number'... I couldn't believe it!&quot;I ran to wake my husband, Robert, who thought the house was on fire because I woke him in such a rush. After we had both double-checked the numbers together, I phoned The National Lottery which is when they confirmed the ticket was a winner. We were in such a daze - the first thing we did was have a cold glass of Diet Coke to celebrate!&quot;Anita, mum to Cheryl, 33, and Robert, 30, said the money was going to make a big difference to her and her family's lives.She said: &quot;We're definitely going to pay off our mortgage and get a new car. Neither of us has ever been abroad, we actually don't even have passports, so I think a long overdue trip to New York is on the cards. Robert has always wanted to go - I'm so happy that I can treat the both of us.&quot;She bought her ticket from the Scotmid, in Stonefield Road, Blantyre.

A MAN has been charged with a sexual offence after a 15-year-old girl was filmed having sex at a party.
The 18-year-old man, from Edinburgh, was traced by police yesterday and is due to appear in court today.
 Detectives launched an inquiry after the Daily Record revealed the explicit video was being shared on social media , with two prominent local sportsmen also at the party. 
Police said they are still looking for the people who filmed the incident, which happened at a sports party attended by a footballer and a boxer on Saturday night.
The 15-year-old girl at the centre of the sex tape was a guest at the bash.
The footballer and boxer have not been named by the Record as we understand they were not involved in any illegal activity.

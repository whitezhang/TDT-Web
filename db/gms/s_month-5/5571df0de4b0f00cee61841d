A TONGUE-TIED Jim Murphy sparked a twitter storm by creating a funny new word during last night's leaders' debate.
The flummoxed Scottish Labour leader sent the internet into meltdown after blurting out 'fundilymundily' instead of fundamentally during the election showdown.
  
The phrase provided some light relief for viewers and the hashtag was soon trending in Scotland.
A vine clip of the moment, capturing First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's hilarious reaction, was also uploaded onto the social networking site.
One amused viewer Tweeted: &quot;Jim Murphy is #FundlyMundly wrong on so many issues.&quot;
Another added: &quot;Easy for you to say Jim Bob.&quot;
The debate saw Scotland's four main party leaders, including the Tories' Ruth Davidson and Lib Dems' Willie Rennie, clash over how public spending should be cut by the UK parliament.

SCOTS founder of Ultimo Michelle Mone announced to Twitter that the businesswoman has decided to move away from Scotland.
The bra tycoon announced to her 926,000 Twitter followers that she had made her decision to follow her business overseas, and spared no disdain for ‘SNP muppets’.
She wrote: 'Been a long hard decision, but I'm moving away for many reasons. Ultimo HQ will still remain. My passion &amp; love will never die for #Scotland.'
 

 

When many questioned her decision to move abroad, she wasted no time in cutting ‘angry, hated and jealous’ SNP supporters down to size - denying she was turning her back on her country.
Many users simply wished her luck with her move, but others were less kind, with one commenting: ‘Perhaps she just doesn't like the fact that The SNP have a voice now.'

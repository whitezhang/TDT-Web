Thousands of young women are assembling in Glasgow this weekend for a party to rival all others.
Now in its fifth year, Girlguiding Scotland’s Tartan Gig on Saturday is a chance for the charity’s young members to enjoy a girl-only pop concert.
More than 6000 girl guides and their senior section will take over the SECC to watch acts including Labrinth, Rixton, Only the Young, Nina Nesbitt, Conor Maynard, Karen Harding and Neon Jungle – with Scottish comedian Iain Stirling returning as the host.
Girlguiding Scotland has 50,000 members and include famous past women such as JK Rowling, Lulu, Edith Bowman and Lorraine Kelly.
Nina Nesbitt said: “It’s so nice to be going back home to Scotland to play at Girlguiding Scotland’s Tartan Gig. I was a Brownie myself and I can’t wait to play for 6,000 Guides – the atmosphere is going to be amazing.”
Only the Young added: “We’re so excited to play for 6,000 Girlguiding Scotland members - they’re a great charity that does so much for girls and we can’t wait to join them on stage in Glasgow – and hear the noise from the crowd.”
But it’s the young guides who are most looking forward to the gig.
Ailsa Cook, 13, of 259th Glasgow Guides, told us: “I'm looking forward to going to the Armadillo.”
And 10-year-old Lucia, also of the 259th, added: “I can't wait to do something new with my guide friends.
And pal Daisy, also 10, said: I’m excited to see some of my favourite acts perform.
Previous performers at the Tartan Gig include Little Mix, Amy Macdonald, Pixie Lott, The Wanted and Scouting for Girls.

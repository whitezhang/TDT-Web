THE families of Clutha victims have been invited to the reopening of the pub later this month.
Owner Alan Crossan wants to open on May 29 - 18 months to the day after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed through the roof.
And he has said he wants the loved ones of victims, as well as survivors and emergency service workers to attend a special reception before the public get back in the bar for the first time.
Pilot David Traill and his passengers, police officers Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins, lost their lives in the crash on November 29, 2013.
In the pub John McGarrigle, Mark O’Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins and Samuel McGhee were killed.
Joe Cusker was pulled from the wreckage but later died in hospital.
Rose Room, the band due to play the day after the crash, are booked to perform on the opening night after a &pound;300,000 refurbishment.
 

Alan said: “We’ve renewed the toilet area in the Clutha - we’re not doing anything else there. These are the first steps.
“It’s not the complete answer, it’s the first steps to get people back into the pub.
“Maybe then we’ll work on everything else.
“I’m trying to bring wee bits of the Clutha back that are relevant.
“It’s whether people come back and like it.
“But the Clutha was never about the building, it’s the people.”

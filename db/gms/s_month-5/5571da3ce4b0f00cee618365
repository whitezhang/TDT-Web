A GANG of naked cyclists are set to descend on Edinburgh to raise awareness of the vulnerability of bike riders.
More than 60 bicycle enthusiasts will strip down in the city’s Meadows area on June 13 as part of the World Naked Bike ride event.
Attendees have been warned to cleverly cover up their naughty bits or face a spot of bother from police.
Issuing nudity guidance, organisers said: “The official dress code is that genitalia should be covered to avoid scaring small children and horses, and after that, go wild.
“In previous years, riders have worn shorts, bras, swimwear, body paint, wigs, sunglasses etc.
“Body painting and adornment, customised bikes and other creative expression are strongly encouraged.”
The planned route will see the cyclists set off from the Meadows at 2pm to the top of Holyrood Park before coming back up through the New Town back to the Meadows.

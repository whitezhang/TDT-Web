GLASGOW Kelvin College has rolled back on a decision to bring the curtain down on an acting course.Higher National Diploma students who had planned to go on to study for the BA Drama and Performance launched a campaign against the cut.The Evening Times then stepped in and now Glasgow Kelvin College has agreed to reconsider.A spokesman for the college said the course could go ahead if enough students apply.&quot;Based on the data from the college-wide internal applications process which showed no internal offers to current HND Acting and Performance students, the very low number of offers made to external candidates and the information tutors provided to management regarding the number of HND students likely to progress, it was evident that there would be insufficient numbers to make the course viable,&quot; the spokeswoman said.&quot;With regret, the college at that point took the decision to withdraw the programme for the forthcoming year and let students know as quickly as possible. Managers pursued alternative options for students and the advice and guidance team were primed to provide students with appropriate support and advice.&quot;However, following representations, the college has agreed to reopen its internal application process for the BA Drama &amp; Performance programme and, should there be a sufficient number of learners who meet the required entrance criteria to run a viable programme, the college will reconsider its decision.&quot;Spokeswoman for the 'Bring back our BA' campaign Abbie Johnston welcomed the decision but warned that the course could yet be cancelled.She said: &quot;We all intend to apply but the college needs at least eighteen students and there are sixteen of us so we hope that it will be reopened to external candidates too.&quot;I don't think the college realised we'd put up a fight and we have so we're making some progress, but we still think the course will probably be cancelled.&quot;We don't trust anything the college management say anymore.&quot;

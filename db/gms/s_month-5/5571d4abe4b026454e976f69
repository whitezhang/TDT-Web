THE winning design for a memorial garden to commemorate babies whose ashes were dumped at Mortonhall Crematorium was revealed today.
In a scandal dating back to the 1960s, the parents of &shy;stillborn babies, or those who died soon after birth, were told there were no ashes.
But in 2012 it emerged that the ashes had been dumped in the gardens of the &shy;Edinburgh City Council-run crematorium.
 

Mums and dads were told a walled water garden had been chosen from four designs for a memorial at Mortonhall.
The original plan had a pond in the centre, but it was replaced with a central stone ball with running water after parents raised concerns. It is due to open in November.
 

A second monument for parents who don’t want to return to Mortonhall will be built in Edinburgh’s Princes Street Gardens.
The memorial was among the &shy;recommendations made by Dame Elish Angiolini’s in her report into the scandal last year.

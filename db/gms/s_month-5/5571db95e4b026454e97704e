 FIRST Minister Nicola Sturgeon will today join 1000 veterans and their families at a service of thanksgiving to mark the 70th anniversary of VE Day . 
 The service at Westminster Abbey in London will also be attended by members of the Royal Family and representatives of the Allied nations and Commonwealth countries that fought alongside Britain. 
 A parade of bands, veterans and current servicemen and women will then make their way from the abbey along Whitehall – past the balcony where wartime prime minister Winston Churchill made his historic speech in front of  vast crowds. 
It will be followed by a reception for veterans in St James’s Park and in the afternoon there will be a fly-past over central London by the Red Arrows and Spitfire and Hurricane fighters.
The day’s events will close a weekend of remembrance.

ONE of Scotland's newest colleges has received a glowing report from education watchdogs.Education Scotland has published its first findings on West College Scotland, a merger between Clydebank College, Reid Kerr College in Paisley and James Watt College in Greenock.Watchdogs put the college under the microscope in March this year and their report is published today.It hails the work of beauty students who ran the Commonwealth Games salon at the Athletes' Village and the community work of construction students who helped display the Great Tapestry of Scotland - at 469 feet, the longest tapestry on earth.Overall, West College Scotland, which employs 1200 staff, was rated &quot;effective&quot;, the highest mark for colleges.Principal Audrey Cumberford said: &quot;We are delighted that the Inspectors have recognised the success of these two fantastic projects and the opportunities they have opened up for so many of our students. &quot;They really have helped them improve their skills and, in some cases, move on to good jobs.&quot;Experts said the success rates for learners on some full-time programmes are in line with the best in the sector, although for others the level slightly below the national sector performance.They praised the college for its successful merger and said students feel well supported by staff.However, in one area for improvement, bosses were warned to make changes to computer access for learners.Ms Cumberford added: &quot;We have received a positive report from Education Scotland and that is wonderful news for us as a College.&quot;Like all newly-merged, regional colleges we have faced a number of challenges.&quot;My staff deserve enormous credit for maintaining and improving their excellent standards of teaching and support, despite so many challenges.&quot;Keith McKellar, chairman of the Regional Board, said: &quot;I thank Audrey and her staff for this outstanding achievement.&quot;The last few years have not been easy for the sector so it is heartening to see the work of West College Scotland recognised in this way.&quot;I know the extent of the challenges involved in merging three colleges into one. To have managed that so successfully while still maintaining educational standards is a testament to the professionalism of all our teaching and support staff.&quot;

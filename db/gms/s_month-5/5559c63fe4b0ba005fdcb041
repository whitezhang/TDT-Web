A US LAWYER who secured &pound;1.7billion for families of the Lockerbie bomb victims has offered to step into the Clutha compensation fight.
Attorney Jerry Skinner plans to meet survivors and relatives of the dead next month.
He is offering to act as a consultant to help vulnerable families as they await payouts over the helicopter crash.
Mr Skinner told the Sun: “One of the favourite tactics in situations like this is to start with those who are weak or financially strapped.
“I want to get everybody together because the parties involved — the responsible ones — will pay more attention if the group is united.”
Seven customers and three crew died when a police helicopter crashed into the Clutha bar in Glasgow in November 2013.

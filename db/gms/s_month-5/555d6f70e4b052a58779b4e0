PASSENGERS on Glasgow's rail network face chaos on the Bank Holiday with train operators cancelling services ahead of a planned strike by rail workers.West Coast main line operator Virgin Trains scrapped all services on Monday and Tuesday and warned it would only be able to run a very limited number of trains on its East Coast line over the two days.An outline of how the strike will affect all train companies is expected today (THURS), but passengers were warned to expect severe disruption if the 24 walkout goes ahead from 5pm on Monday.ScotRail was one of five companies to warn of the cuts to the service yesterday.They said limited services would run on Bank Holiday Monday and Tuesday, with all trains cancelled on some lines.On Monday, two trains will run each hour between Glasgow and Paisley Gilmour Street.A similar service will run between Glasgow and Maxwell Park and Queens Park on the same day.Trains between Glasgow and Edinburgh, through Falkirk High, will run every 15 minutes as usual.A ScotRail statement read: &quot;The planned industrial action for Monday May 25 and Tuesday May 26 will mean that virtually all rail services across Scotland will be cancelled.&quot;Passengers were being advised not to travel unless &quot;absolutely necessary&quot;, with widespread cancellations expected, leading to packed trains.A legal challenge by Network Rail (NR) against the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) ballot is listed for this afternoon in the High Court.NR also urged train passengers to be prepared for the strike, saying it could not bank on unions calling off the planned stoppage.The two sides were continuing to hold talks at the conciliation service Acas, and NR said its negotiators will be available into the weekend if necessary to try to head off a strike.Chief executive Mark Carne said: &quot;We are continuing to talk with the unions and we believe there is a settlement to be had. I sincerely hope we can reach one and my team will be available all week, and into the weekend if necessary, to find a deal to prevent strike action.&quot;From the very start of negotiations we made clear that we want to reward our staff for the incredible job they do, but that any pay rise needs to be linked to smarter, more effective ways of working.&quot;We can't bank on the unions calling off the strike, so we are now concluding our contingency plans so passengers can make decisions about their journeys.&quot;If the strike goes ahead, it's important that people check before travelling and are aware of the special measures put in place by train operators for people who have already booked tickets.&quot;Full details of amended timetables and what services will run, when and where, are expected to be available from train operators by Saturday, with &quot;overviews and summaries&quot; available from today.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union and the TSSA have rejected a four-year pay deal of &pound;500 followed by three years of rises in line with RPI inflation.Train operators are working with NR on contingency plans, which will be &quot;fine-tuned&quot; over the next few days.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: &quot;RMT is continuing to push for a negotiated settlement through the Acas talks and the union is available right the way through the weekend to keep that process going, if necessary.&quot;In the meantime, our picketing arrangements are in place and the response coming back from our members is one of rock-solid support.&quot;We would remind the public that we have been forced into this dispute through a wholly-unwarranted attack on safety-critical jobs, pay and working conditions that would seriously undermine the safety of passengers on our railways into the future.&quot;RMT members are standing up for the principle of a properly staffed and resourced railway where safety comes first and where corners aren't cut to hit budget targets.&quot;Virgin said: &quot;Customers planning to travel on the affected dates will need to make alternative arrangements. If you are planning to travel on Sunday May 24 or Wednesday May 27 we recommend that you check before you travel for more information on how your journey may be affected.&quot;We appreciate that many customers will have their travel plans disrupted by the planned industrial action, so train companies have agreed to put in place special arrangements to make it easier for you to complete your journey.&quot;

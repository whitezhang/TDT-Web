 AN UNKNOWN Glasgow pensioner has won &pound;240,000 from a &pound;30,000 bet on a Conservative majority. 
 The bet was placed at a Ladbrokes branch in Glasgow at odds of 7/1. 
Ladbrokes bookmakers have paid out &pound;2m to punters who backed Tory success.
A record-breaking number of bets were placed including bets from first-time political punters.

Bookies’ forecast for most seats and most votes once again more accurate than pollster predictions.
 Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: “The Conservative supporters who kept the faith in their party defying the odds and polls have collected a packet at our expense. We believe our customer in central Glasgow has also become the biggest election winner of the entire campaign and we tip our hat to his political forecasting skills. 
“Every cloud has a silver lining and we saw record interest in this election as a betting event. Clearly there’s now an incredible appetite for political betting nationwide and we have plenty of fascinating contests to look forward to as a result of this outcome.”

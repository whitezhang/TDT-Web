THREE city youngsters have been chosen to represent Unicef UK at a summit at a summit which starts in Berlin today.Emily Clark and Kelsey McGrotty who are both aged 15 and Jonas Black, 14, are taking part in the J7 Youth Summit which runs until May 13.The summit provides young people with a chance to have their voices heard and shape opinions at the G7 Leaders Summit in June, where governments and heads of state of the G7 nations will discuss global political issues.Emily, Kelsey and Jonas who attend Woodfarm High School are three of six young people from the UK who will take part in discussions with youth representatives and experts from the other G7 countries.They will discuss topics on the G7 agenda including climate change, poverty as well as development and empowerment of girls and women.At the end of the summit they will meet with German Chancellor Angela Merkel to present their results and recommendations.Jonas Black, age 14, said: &quot;I am very passionate about the things that Unicef works to achieve for young children. There are some very important topics that need to be addressed at the G7 and the leaders should listen to what children and young people have to say.&quot;Emily Clark, age 15, said: I'm really passionate about the youth voice and Unicef is going to give us a chance to bring this to the world leaders. I hope that other people my age will look for ways to get involved and spread their opinion.&quot;Kelsey McGrotty, age 15, said: &quot;I got involved in the J7 to help people around the world and to help with the topics that Unicef works on in 190 countries across the world. I want to tell the G7 that more needs to be done to promote children's rights to protect children in danger.&quot;Unicef UK Executive Director David Bull said: &quot;Children have a right to a voice and to be heard on all matters that affect them. The G7 leaders' decisions impact heavily on children's lives and the J7 Youth Summit is an opportunity for these six young people from the UK to really make their voices heard at the highest international level. We are immensely proud of Emily, Kelsey and Jonas and hope that this experience will be their first step in becoming powerful advocates for children's rights.&quot;The delegates were selected through Unicef UK's Rights Respecting Schools, a network of over 3,300 primary and secondary schools across the UK that embed children's rights in their ethos and culture. Unicef is the world's leading children's organisation, working in 190 countries for every child to be healthy and safe from danger.For more information about the J7 Youth Summit please visit www.j7summit.org or search for J7summit on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

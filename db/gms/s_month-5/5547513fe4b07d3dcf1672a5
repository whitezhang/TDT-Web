A SCOTS great-gran says she is hoping to celebrate her 100th birthday under a Labour government.
 Helen McCombes cast her first vote in 1945, when she helped sweep Labour leader Clement Attlee into power after World War II. 
His government went on to transform the country – creating the NHS and a cradle-to-grave welfare state.
Helen, who will celebrate her centenary on May 27, says she has been a supporter of the Labour Party ever since.
She said: “I’ve always voted Labour. My mother voted Conservative but after I got married, my husband John’s family were Labour supporters and I became one, too.
“They were the party that wanted to help ordinary people and I think they still are.”
 Helen has lived in Glasgow ’s Pollokshaws all her life. Her first job, after leaving school at the age of 14, was in a chocolate factory. She married her late husband John in 1939, shortly before he had to leave to fight in Africa during World War II. They had two daughters, Anne and Sandra. 
 Helen added: “I’m looking forward to my birthday party and getting my telegram from the Queen . I’ve already voted by post and I’m hoping Labour win. 
“I wasn’t interested in independence. I think we need to stick together, to try and make things better for everyone.”
Glasgow South Labour MP Tom Harris visited Helen yesterday and promised to return for her birthday party this month – whether he has won or lost.
He said: “Helen is an amazing character. I’m proud and privileged to have her support.”

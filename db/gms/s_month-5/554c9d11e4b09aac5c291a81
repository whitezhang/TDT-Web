Police are investigating after a man was run over and then shot in a &quot;targeted attack&quot; in the north of Glasgow.
The 29-year-old was seriously injured in the attack in Royston, which is being treated as attempted murder.
The victim got out of his Audi car on Royston Road at about 18:30 on Thursday before he was &quot;deliberately&quot; struck by a white Mitsubishi 4x4.
A man then got out of the car and shot him while he was on the ground.
The car made off at speed from the area, being driven &quot;erratically&quot;, and was recovered in Robroyston a short time later.
Officers are carrying out door-to-door inquiries in the area, and are reviewing CCTV footage. They appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident or saw the Mitsubishi between Royston Road and Robroyston to come forward.
The victim was taken to hospital by ambulance, where staff described his condition as serious but stable.
Det Insp Ogilvie Ross, of Greater Glasgow CID, said: &quot;It is imperative that we catch those responsible for this attack. Thankfully no-one else was injured but it is very obvious that those responsible did not have any thought for the safety of the locals. 
&quot;Royston Road is residential with lots of people about, especially at that time of the evening, and to discharge a firearm in that kind of area, and especially at that time, is absolutely outrageous.&quot;
Police do not currently believe the incident is linked to the shooting in Haywood Street in April.

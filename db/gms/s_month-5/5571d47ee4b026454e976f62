 GLAM wag Leah Shevlin will tie the knot with Scotland goalie Allan McGregor on the same Scottish island where JLS singer JB Gill and fashion designer Stella McCartney got married 
Former Rangers hero Allan, 33, and ex-model Leah, 32, will say ‘I do’ on Bute which is fast becoming an A-list hotspot.
The exact venue remains secret but a wedding notice posted outside council offices in Rothesay confirmed they will be married next month.
 The news comes after our sister paper the Sunday Mail revealed that Leah Shevlin partied with friends on her hen weekend in London . 
The 32-year-old mum of one travelled by first class train from Hull to London with a posse of her friends for a night on the tiles.
The WAG tweeted a photo of herself on the train sipping a canned cocktail with a rude novelty straw.
 

It’s thought she hired a “party bus” to whisk the group around London, stopping off for more cocktails before heading to a top restaurant.

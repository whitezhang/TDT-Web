A former footballer who admitted conducting a two-year stalking campaign against his ex-girlfriend has been told to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. 
Martin Hardie, 38, from Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire, targeted Kirsty MacLeod from September 2012 to November 2014.
He climbed up a drainpipe to spy on her and repeatedly turned up at her work.
Hardie,who played for Partick Thistle, St Johnstone, Kilmarnock, Dunfermline, Morton and Airdrie, was told he could not contact Ms MacLeod for two years. 
The condition was imposed as part of his community payback order.
Hardie had initially denied the charge before admitting that he &quot;engaged in conduct&quot; which left Ms MacLeod in &quot;fear or alarm&quot;. 
Glasgow Sheriff Court previously heard that he turned up at Ms MacLeod's flat in the Mansewood area of Glasgow and clambered up a drainpipe and &quot;did watch or spy on her through a window&quot;. 
Hardie also repeatedly telephoned and texted Ms MacLeod. 
The charge stated the former footballer showed up at her work at Braehead Shopping Centre and &quot;attempted to engage in conversation&quot;. 
Hardie also took a photo of Ms MacLeod's vehicle and sent it to her.

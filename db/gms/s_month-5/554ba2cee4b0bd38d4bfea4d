A pub has proved popular with voters after being converted into a polling station for the day.The Hare and Hounds, in Corsham, Wiltshire, has been used as a polling station since 2010 and many voters enjoy a pint after casting their ballot.Landlord Mark Foster, 41, is licensed to serve alcohol at the pub from 8am, an hour after voting begins, but began at 11am today.&quot;This is the fourth time that this pub has been used, it was first used in 2010,&quot; he said.&quot;It is extremely popular, it is in the heart of the community and very well-known.&quot;Having a polling station here makes it accessible for voters - it is an easy place to find, with a big car park.&quot;Of course it is always nice to stop for a drink after voting too.&quot;The pub will close at 11pm - an hour after polling stations shut across the country.Matthew Dean, 43, a local resident, said the pub was in a target seat for the Conservative Party.He said: &quot;The pub is lovely - it has car parking, it is warm, it is undercover.&quot;There's no question that it encourages people to vote. It is so accessible to people here and that's really important.&quot;It gives people that boost to drive up and vote and maybe enjoy a drink after.&quot;Mr Dean was outside the pub with councillor Alan McRae in support of Conservative candidate Michelle Donelan.

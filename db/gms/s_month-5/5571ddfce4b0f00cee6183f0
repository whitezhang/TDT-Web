A SHOP boss who hit the headlines after text bullying claims has quit.
Declan McCurdie , 17, left his job and went public after Subway franchise holder Kenny Thomson sent him a string of messages.
The texts – dating back to February – criticised Declan’s performance and insulted him.
Yesterday, Thomson said he no longer has any association with the company.
The Record told last week how the messages were like something the Ricky Gervais character David Brent would say in hit comedy The Office.
One text read: “You were c**p last week. This week you are the toilet paper! Much better effort. But still slow as a week in jail. Get to bed early.”
 

After he had left his job, Ayr lad Declan asked Thomson who his boss was. Thomson claimed he was the director and didn’t have “an area manager or boss”.
Thousands of people shared Thomson’s messages after Declan’s mum posted them online.
Last week, Declan said: “I’m studying hospitality at college and this was my first job so I have been left pretty upset by the way the whole thing went.
“I was new and so I had to learn but Kenny turned out to be a complete bully.
“Since the texts have been on the internet, I’ve had emails from around the world congratulating me for eventually standing up for myself.”
 

Thomson said he has quit the Ayr Central shop. He told our sister paper the Ayrshire Post: “I have terminated my franchise agreement with Subway. I’m no longer involved in any way.”
Thomson and his wife Michelle were named as Subway’s franchisee of the year for Scotland in 2013.
A Subway spokesman said: “We are very concerned to hear about this situation.
“We expect high standards for the behaviour of our staff, partners and franchisees and we are looking into this employment matter as a priority with the owner.”

IT looks like the thin blue line just got much thinner as police fight shoplifters with officers made of cardboard.
The cut-outs are to be used in shops in major railway stations to deter thieves.
The British Transport Police trial started earlier this month with a cardboard cut-out at Boots in Queen Street, Glasgow.
It is hoped they will make shoplifters think twice by reminding them that officers are on patrol.
If successful, the life-size cardboard policemen may be popping up across Scotland.
BTP said: “The British Transport Police in Leeds are doing this and it has been successful. There have been issues with shoplifting, especially in the Queen Street and Central stations in Glasgow.

“We are trialling the cardboard cut-outs to try to deter shoplifters. We’ll check to see if there is a need for it elsewhere in the country.”
But BTP in Leeds have no figures to show how successful the trial has been.
Last year, it was revealed police in England have spent more than &pound;50,000 on cardboard officers.
 Almost half of Britain’s forces have invested in the replicas since 2008. But some have been stolen or vandalised. 
Boots said: “We take shoplifting and the safety of our colleagues extremely seriously. At the request of local police, we are supporting this initiative at Queen Street.” But Tory justice spokeswoman Margaret Mitchell said: “We know the BTP are unhappy with proposals of amalgamating them with Police Scotland.
“I hope this isn’t a sign of things to come, where they’re taken off transport duties to the point we’re looking at cardboard cutouts.”

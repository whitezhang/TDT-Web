TWO neds interfered with live TV coverage of a Scottish Premiership match by lighting flares under a cameraman.
Kieran Devlin and Aaron Moir, both 17, put fans in danger during a midweek clash between St Johnstone and Celtic.
A court heard the camera operator had to stop working because the smoke from the flares made it impossible for him to film the game.
He had to climb down from Sky Sports’s purpose-built stanchion and kick one of the lit flares away before he was able to resume his part in the live broadcast.
At Perth Sheriff Court yesterday, Celtic fans Devlin, of Lenzie, Glasgow, and Moir, of nearby Lennoxtown, admitted endangering others by setting off flares at McDiarmid Park in Perth on August 13.
Fiscal depute Stuart Richardson told the court: “The match was being filmed by Sky Sports and a stanchion was erected so a cameraman could get on top and film the match.
“In the course of doing that, he suddenly saw a flare being ignited below and smoke coming out.
“He actually had to come down because the smoke was obscuring the view from his camera. He kicked the flare away.
“He looked down again and someone was trying to ignite a second flare but this was unsuccessful. The first one emitted a fair amount of smoke in the stand where supporters were sitting.”
Devlin’s lawyer said he was “extremely remorseful”.
Solicitor David Holmes, for Moir, added: “They were told they weren’t welcome at any matches involving the team (Celtic).”
Sheriff Fiona Tait ordered Devlin and Moir to carry out 140 hours’ unpaid work in the community as a direct alternative to detention.

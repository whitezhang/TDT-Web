THE re-opening of the Clutha has been pushed back as builders work round-the-clock to finish the refurbishment.Owner Alan Crossan had hoped to open the pub this Friday, May 29, exactly a year and a half after a police helicopter plunged through the roof, killing 10 people and injuring dozens of others.However, the discovery of some rot in the roof of the Victoria lounge part of the bar has added extra work on to the project.Mr Crossan still wants to see the bar open at 5pm on a Friday - but it is likely to be June 5 or June 12.As we revealed earlier in the month, he is inviting relatives of victims who died in the tragedy on November 29, 2013 as well as survivors and emergency service workers.The band Rose Room, which was due to perform the day after the crash, will take to the stage on the re-opening night.Mr Crossan said: &quot;We're almost there but having to deal with the problems in the Victoria means we need more time before we can open.&quot;We want to open as soon as possible so it will be Friday next week or the week after.&quot;Mr Crossan said he hoped that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon could attend the re-launch.The refurbishment - costing around &pound;300,000 - has included building new toilets, remodelling the kitchen, installing a pizza oven and transforming the decor.A stunning mural being led by Art Pistol featuring famous faces, including Jimmy Reid and Billy Connolly, is being wrapped around the building.Pilot David Traill and his passengers, Kirsty Nelis and Tony Collins, lost their lives in the crash, which happened just before 10.25pm.Those killed in the pub were John McGarrigle, Mark O'Prey, Gary Arthur, Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins and Samuel McGhee.Joe Cusker was pulled from the wreckage but later died in hospital.The Clutha Trust, which was set up in the aftermath of the tragedy to support young people, will still hold a festival in Clyde Street this Saturday.Mr Crossan said: &quot;This is going to be a real family day with live music, food and wrestling in the Briggait and we would encourage people to come along and enjoy it.&quot;

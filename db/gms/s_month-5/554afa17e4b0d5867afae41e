DRAMA students at a Glasgow college have been left in the lurch after the curtain came down on their course.Those studying for the Higher National Diploma in Acting and Performance at Glasgow Kelvin College had expected to progress to a degree course at their campus in the east end.But too few students applied for the BA Drama and Performance next year and the course was cut.The head of faculty for creative and digital Industries told students last week and some claim they won't have enough time to apply to continue their studies at other colleges and universities.Abigail Johnston, who is in second year of the HND, said: &quot;Our year group as a whole have felt like we have been mistreated by our superiors.&quot;This news has come to us too late to apply for other colleges and around 80% of us are being forced into unemployment due to this.&quot;We want to get some justice for the complete inconvenience and we want them to feel a little bit of remorse.&quot;It has been a waste of a year for almost all of us and it has been a waste of education funding for us.&quot;Fellow student Norman Dewars said: &quot;The cutting of year three of the drama and performance degree programme has left HND acting and performance second year students homeless.&quot;At this time of the year we have nowhere to which we can realistically apply with the hope of getting a place.&quot;This is completely unacceptable treatment of young people endeavouring to further their education.&quot;A spokeswoman for Glasgow Kelvin insisted HND students are given no guarantee of progression to a degree at the college.She said: &quot;Due to the extremely low level of applications for the BA drama and performance programme, and with no recorded internal offers made to current HND programme students, the college has taken the decision not to offer the first year BA course for session 2015/16.&quot;There is no automatic progression from the HND acting and performance programme as there is a competitive selection process for this degree and this is made clear to applicants as they enter the two-year HND programme.&quot;The college has continually reviewed applications for the BA degree programme in drama and performance and is disappointed that it has now had to take this decision, which it has done as promptly as possible.&quot;The Evening Times understands students have been given support by college staff as they &quot;explore other progression routes&quot;.The BA Drama and Performance is also expected to be reinstated by Glasgow Kelvin College after a one year break.The college spokeswoman said: &quot;The second year of the BA (Hons) drama and performance will proceed this year and it is anticipated that the first year BA drama and performance degree programme will commence again in session 2016/17.&quot;

SCOTS rockers Twin Atlantic played the biggest show of their career so far, headlining the SSE Hydro in Glasgow and just about blowing the roof off.
Thanks to the Twin boys and Red Bull Records, the Daily Record got an exclusive peek behind the scenes on the day, as Sam McTrusty, Craig Kneale, Ross Mc Nae and Barry McKenna built up to the most exciting night of their lives yet.
Check out our exclusive video shot by Paul Bugler and you'll understand why the boys are still buzzing from an incredible show (awarded six stars out of five by our sister paper the Sunday Mail's review).
 

Drummer Craig Kneale told us: &quot;The Hydro show is something we're still coming to terms with.
&quot;I know that I'm still on a high from it, more than a week since it took place.
&quot;It was a very special night for us, our first arena show and a new challenge that we relished from the second we stepped out on stage.
&quot;The reaction we received was overwhelming, It had this strange effect on the four of us in that it relaxed us and let us fully take in that experience in the moment.&quot;

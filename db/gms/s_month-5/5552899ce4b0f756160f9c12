STUNT cyclist Danny MacAskill beat the traffic – and the shoppers – in Glasgow city centre as he hopped over bollards and benches on a near-deserted Sauchiehall Street in the early hours of this morning.
Releasing the video on his Facebook page today, MacAskill said: “Went out for a wee sesh this morning on the hight street before the shops opened. Mount Creative behind the GoPro #530am #Blowingahooly”.

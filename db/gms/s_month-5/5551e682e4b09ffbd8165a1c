AN animal charity is appealing for information after a dog was found in a poor condition in Glasgow.The Scottish SPCA was alerted on Tuesday 5 May after the Lhasa Apso was discovered on Kinfauns Road in Drumphapel.The dog is now in the care of the charity's Lanarkshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre, where staff have named him Barry.Inspector Gillian Dick said, &quot;It looks as though the fur on Barry's torso has been clipped recently but his leg and ear hair were badly matted.&quot;He has an infected open sore on one of his legs which he is now receiving treatment for.&quot;We would like to speak to the person who owned Barry and would urge anyone who recognises him to contact us so we can establish how he came to be in this condition.&quot;Causing an animal unnecessary suffering is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.Anyone with information is being urged to contact the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999.

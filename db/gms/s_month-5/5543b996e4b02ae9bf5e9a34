FORMER First Minister Henry McLeish has stepped down from his role as the chair of the troubled board overseeing Glasgow Colleges.Mr McLeish had come under increasing pressure over his role on the Glasgow Colleges Regional Board after four members quit, citing concerns over the way the board was being run.Earlier it had emerged that Mr McLeish had resign as chairman of the Colleges Scotland board, which represents college management, reportedly to allow him to &quot;concentrate and focus&quot; on his role on the Glasgow board.But the Scottish Government has now announced that Mr McLeish has stood down after three years as regional lead, then chair, of the Glasgow organisation.Mr McLeish said: &quot;I am pleased to have taken GCRB to the position where it is now ready to move to the next stage, with a fresh set of challenges to be tackled by the incoming Chair. This represents a new chapter in the college regionalisation agenda and I was grateful to have had the opportunity to play my part in progress to date.&quot;I have prioritised my energy on Glasgow over recent years and am proud of what has been achieved. This is a good time for me to move on and focus on the other pressures.&quot;My life embraces a great deal of interests including politics, football, writing, lecturing and of course chairing the National Mining Museum of Scotland. This is an appropriate point to spend more time on these important interests and move on from a position which, although very rewarding, has also been very demanding in terms of time, commitment and travel.&quot;Scottish Funding Council board member Ali Jarvis has been appointed as interim chair.Education Secretary Angela Constance said: &quot;The Scottish Government is grateful to Mr McLeish for his contribution to Glasgow colleges since taking up his leadership role in 2012. He has supported the development of the Board, and taken it to a position where it is now ready to move to the next stage in delivering for our college reform programme in the city.&quot;This is a key moment for a new Chair to inject a fresh approach, bringing together students, staff and management to progress this shared endeavour.&quot;Speaking about Ms Jarvis's appointment, Mr Constance said: &quot; Her wealth of experience, and deep commitment to students, leaves her well-placed for this role.&quot;

Full service law firm Harper Macleod is gearing for expansion on reporting fee income rose to a “record” &pound;22 million in the 2015 year to March.
The firm, reporting financial results in lieu of audited accounts being filed with Companies House, said profits rose 7.5 per cent “to almost &pound;8 million” in the year.
Harper Macleod has also announced it will triple its current office space in Edinburgh with a move in June to Citypoint at 65 Haymarket Terrace.
The firm is also planning to open new offices in locations where it is currently serving clients but has no physical presence, though locations have yet to be finalised.
Harper Macleod said its full-year results were bolstered from its acquisition of private client solicitors Bird Semple in August of last year, and acquisition estimated at the time would see the firm “grow by around 10 per cent” to an estimated turnover of “more than &pound;23 million”.
From September 1 last year, around 35 Bird Semple partners, lawyers and staff joined Harper Macleod's existing private client team at its Glasgow headquarters.
Two new partners are also set to join the firm, in the Edinburgh-based banking and finance and dispute resolution teams, which will take the firm's partner count to 63.
Chief executive Martin Darroch said: “We've doubled the number of partners on the ground in Edinburgh over the past two years and around a quarter of our partners advise clients and operate out of our offices there already.
“The new office assists our growth aspirations as we continue to identify talented individuals and teams to join the firm.”
Harper Macleod said it employed 313 at the year to March 31, 2015.

THE Police Scotland detective who was in charge of the investigation into the murder of student Karen Buckley is set to pen letters to members of the Irish public to thank them for their support.
 The qualified nurse, who was in Glasgow to do a masters degree, went missing following a night out in Glasgow's West End on April 11. 
A spokesman for Police Scotland confirmed that Detective Superintendent Jim Kerr will send an open letter to people who contacted his team during the investigation to express his gratitude for their support.

The open letter will thank members of the public for their efforts.
 Following a wide search, police then found her body on a farm and a 21-year-old man was arrested and charged with her murder. 
 Her funeral was held in Cork last week.

GLASGOW has seen the largest annual increase in rent prices, up 5% from last year, new figures show.The average residential rent in Scotland has climbed 1.6% since April 2014, according to lettings agent Your Move.It now stands at &pound;539 following the fastest year-on-year increase for five months.Rents in the Glasgow and Clyde area went up by an average of &pound;27 to &pound;563, with the east of the country recording the second biggest rise of 1.7% to &pound;531.Rents in Edinburgh and the Lothians are now cheaper than they were a year previously, down 0.8% in the twelve months to April to &pound;588.In the Highlands &amp; Islands rents dropped 0.6% to &pound;540 while the south recorded a modest 0.7% climb to &pound;498.Brian Moran, area lettings director at Your Move, said: &quot;After rental prices plateaued over the winter months, we're seeing annual rent rises start to ascend again.&quot;Affordability in the private rented sector now rests on new housing becoming available to let, and more choice for tenants, to keep rents competitive and rent rises in check.&quot;Solid rent rises offer clear encouragement for those contemplating buy-to-let investment but fears of prohibitive rent controls and additional tenancy legislation in Scotland may be off-putting, which could choke off new supply of rented homes and drive up prices for tenants.&quot;Your Move said the level of rent arrears in Scotland increased to 9.2% in April from 6.2% last year.Mr Moran said: &quot;Household finances are a struggle for some in Scotland and a minority of tenants are still mired in the red.&quot;Renters are much more likely to be in a job than a year ago but when it comes to paying the rent on time, wages are critical too.&quot;Much headway has been made regarding the employment rate in Scotland but it's time for earnings to experience the same growth.&quot;Landlords' total annual returns doubled in the past year to 15.2% - mainly as a result of accelerating house price growth before the new Land and Buildings Transaction Tax was introduced, according to Your Move.The typical landlord in Scotland has seen a return, before any mortgage payments or maintenance costs, of &pound;23,820 in the year to April 2015.Mr Moran said: &quot;It's worth remembering that we're experiencing some extraordinary behaviour in the Scottish housing market at the moment, which lies largely at the root of this.&quot;House prices in Scotland are currently rising twice as fast as those in the rest of England and Wales, as a result of a short-term shot of activity before the new transaction tax was enforced.&quot;Now we're under the new regime, this momentum is likely to calm to more sustainable levels - so landlords should adjust their expectations accordingly.&quot;Long-term capital gains should always be a plus for all landlords, rather than something to take for granted.&quot;

THE two Scottish party leaders entered the final week of campaigning promising to fight for every vote.Nicola Sturgeon and Jim Murphy both unveiled new campaign posters and then set off to ensure they return as many MPs as possible.Ms Sturgeon launched the SNP poster claiming more SNP MPs means more power for Scotland.It shows the House of Commons green benches turning tartan.Mr Murphy focussed on Labour's claim that the SNP is seeking to hold another referendum, with a cross roads sign offering an alternative of a fairer economy with Labour.The SNP leader then set off on a helicopter tour of Scotland campaigning across the country, starting in the Borders.The SNP campaign has been about a 'stronger voice for Scotland' and opposing austerity and she stuck to the message.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;There's now only one week to go until the election and the extent of the opportunity in Scotland's grasp is becoming clearer by the day - and I'm looking forward to taking the SNP's positive, anti-austerity message to communities in every corner of Scotland.&quot;The SNP will use our influence at Westminster to make sure every part of Scotland has a strong voice in the House of Commons, put an end to the cuts and advance progressive politics for everyone in the UK - but we can only do that with the support of people in communities across Scotland next Thursday.&quot;Mr Murphy said he knew Labour was going into the final week behind the SNP but said the positive message about a fairer economy and improving life for working class families will resonate with voters.He said: &quot;We will keep working hard and the message is this is a choice between a fairer economy and another referendum. We will continue to hammer that message home.&quot;Mr Murphy said a vote for the SNP would be to &quot;turn the clock back&quot; for another referendum campaign.Mr Murphy said despite Ms Sturgeon's statements that the election was not about another referendum, the party's supporters would demand it as soon as possible.He said &quot;There are 100,000 members of the SNP itching for another referendum.&quot;He said Labour was promoting an alternative of a positive message of a fairer economy.Following polls suggesting the SNP could win every seat in Scotland, Mr Murphy said he was confident of retaining his in East Renfrewshire.He said: &quot;I have always been the underdog. I confounded the bookies, critics and pundits in 2010 and I'm confident I will do so again.&quot;Labour's deputy leader Kezia Dugdale continued the theme at the last First Minister's Questions before the election.She said: &quot;When next to no progress has been made to close the gap between those from the poorest and wealthiest backgrounds in our schools, the SNP's priorities are all wrong.&quot;The reality is that under the SNP the three Rs don't mean reading, writing and arithmetic, they really mean referendum, referendum, referendum.&quot;Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;This is desperate last throw of the dice stuff from Scottish labour, talk about a party in its death throes.She said Labour was: &quot;Resorting to scaremongering about a referendum nobody is proposing. Let me put it in simple terms. This election is not about independence or a referendum no matter how many seats the SNP wins. It is about making sure Scotland's voice is heard much more loudly than ever before.&quot;Ms Sturgeon said the only people talking about a second referendum were Scottish Labour.However Ms Dugdale said SNP candidates across the country were openly discussing the prospect of another referendum.

The Palestinian ambassador met politicians at Glasgow City Chambers last week.Manuel Hassassian held an &quot;informal discussion&quot; with council leader Gordon Matheson, according to a spokesman for the local authority.Civic leaders controversially flew the Palestinian flag from the chambers last year to show solidarity with those affected by the conflict in Gaza in the face of opposition from some members of the Jewish and political community.The move prompted the city's only Conservative councillor David Meikle to unfurl an Israeli flag from a balcony at the front of the building.Thousands of people then signed a petition calling for Meikle to resign.Hundreds of Palestinians and dozens of Israelis have been killed in fighting between Israel and Palestinian Islamic organisation Hamas.Ambassador Hassassian's visit On May 15 was welcomed by Councillor Soryia Siddique.She said: &quot;This is a continued relationship of humanity, social justice and solidarity. Glasgow City Council has been proactive in standing for social justice, locally nationally and internationally.&quot;A council spokesman described the ambassador's visit as a &quot;courtesy call&quot;.He said: &quot;Ambassador Hassassian visited the city chambers, where he met with the leader of the council, Gordon Matheson, and a small group of councillors.&quot;There was no set agenda. An informal discussion took place over a cup of tea. Issues raised included the Ambassador's academic career, his desire to secure a sustainable peace with Israel, and his plans to visit Rome to witness the canonisation of two 19th century Palestinian nuns.&quot;The Evening Times contacted Councillor David Meikle for comment but he did not respond.

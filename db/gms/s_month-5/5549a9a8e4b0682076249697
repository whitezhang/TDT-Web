The House of Lords has had its day according to our survey results.It could spell bad news for some MPs about to lose their seats or retire as a MP when a seat in the second chamber is often the next step.There are 26 Lords who are in place due to their role as Bishops in the Church of England, 92 Hereditary Peers due to their birth and 663 Life Peers appointed by governments.We found almost eight out of ten people surveyed wanted it either scrapped or reformed.In total 55.5% of people who answered the question wanted it abolished, 23.5% wanted it reformed and only 21% said we should keep it as it is.Labour wants to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with a Senate of the Nations and RegionsIt states: &quot;This reformed second chamber of the UK parliament will help bind together the United Kingdom and improve democratic legitimacy. It will also give Scotland another strong voice at the heart of our democracy.&quot;The SNP plan is to scrap the Lords system.Its manifesto pledge states: &quot;An unelected second chamber is not acceptable in a modern democracy. Those with no democratic mandate should not be writing the laws of the land and SNP MSPs will vote for the abolition of the House of Lords.&quot;The Tories and LibDems in coalition proposed a plan for reform of the Lords which would have led to wither a fully elected second chamber or part elected with almost half the Bishops remaining.The plan was however later dropped from the Government's programme.Recent Scottish appointments to the Lords include former First Minister, Jack McConnell, former LibDem Deputy First Minister Nicol Stephen and Tory MSP Annabel Goldie.The SNP do not make recommendations to or accept seats in the House of Lords

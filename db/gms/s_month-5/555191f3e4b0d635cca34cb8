THE work of Glasgow-based textiles designer Laura Spring is finding a new groove with fans of the band Belle & Sebastian.The Glasgow School of Art graduate with a thriving line of distinctive screenprinted accessories has designed a collection for the band.On sale at merchandising stalls on the Glasgow band's current tour, the range of notebooks, phone and sunglasses pouches and rucksacks, priced from &pound;5, is also available on their website at www.belleandsebastianshop.com.&quot;Fiona Morrison, who organises all the band's merchandising, bought one of my duffel bags last summer and I said, 'If you ever want me to do anything I'd be happy to',&quot; said Laura, who has worked on previous collaborations with high street cosmetics store Lush.&quot;She suggested coming in to have a chat and it went from there.&quot;She said, 'Go away and come up with a design'. I wasn't told I had to work on a specific theme.&quot;My idea at first was looking at travel because they didn't want a design that was specific to the current album so that it didn't date.&quot;Inspired by Wes Anderson films and thoughts of childhood adventures and her own love of maps, Laura came up with the idea for the print.&quot;It came from the symbol for a train line on old OS maps that I made into a repeat pattern and added the band name,&quot; she said.All items are available in a choice of three colours: orange, green and light blue. They are made in the UK with the fabric of the bags and pouches screen-printed in-house by Laura at her studio in the north of the city.

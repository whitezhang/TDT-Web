UNION leaders have called for improvements to Scotland's Fatal Accident Inquiry system to help bereaved families.The Scottish Government has proposed a bill to reform FAIs but STUC and the RMT union want it to go further.The union leaders told MSPs on the Scottish Parliament Justice Committee they backed proposals in a Members Bill by Glasgow Labour MSP Patricia Ferguson to go further and introduce a timescale where announcements had to be made.Ian Tasker of the STUC said a six month deadline for an announcement whether an FAI would be held was reasonable.He said: &quot;If the Lord Advocate felt there was a need for an extension it would be irresponsible for Trade unions not to support it.&quot;Mr Tasker said in cases where there are no FAIs and companies plead guilty to criminal negligence the families do not get answers.The union leaders called for a statement of fact on workplace deaths to be issues as soon as possible.Jake Molloy of the RMT said it should: &quot;Address the concerns of the families and share the specific facts to prevent re-occurrence.&quot;Ms Ferguson agreed that a guilty plea meant no explanation of facts was provided for the families of the deceased.Justice Committee convenor Christine Grahame said she was concerned that early release of information cold prejudice any criminal proceedings or subsequent FAI.She said: &quot;It wouldn't be suitable in all circumstances.&quot;Mr Tasker also wanted Trades Unions to be a recognised party at FAI hearings to allow them, to represent workers and their families.He said the STUC was heavily involved in supporting families after the Stockline tragedy in Maryhill in 2004.He said STUC was prepared to act whether the workplace was unionised or not.

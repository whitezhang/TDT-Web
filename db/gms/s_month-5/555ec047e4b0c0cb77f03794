PARTICK Thistle has issued a reminder to ALL staff that betting on football matches is forbidden.Forward Steven Lawless was given a two game immediate band and four suspended after being found to have breached SFA guidelines on gambling.The 24-year-old was initially charged with placing bets on 513 matches, becoming the fourth player to contravene rule 33 which states no player, coach, club official or referee in Scotland bet on a game throughout the world.The Evening Times has learned that it is a measure that is enforced as a blanket ban at Firhill, with all employees including non-football members of staff being reminded not to indulge in a flutter.The rules state no club official is allowed to bet on a football game, but there is no definition on what constitutes this role.It is unclear when Thistle bosses first imposed the restriction, but it is understood the measure has been underlined in last few days to make sure the club don't fall foul of any grey area in relation to betting sanctions.A statement from Thistle yesterday added: &quot;The club and player accept the SFA decision regarding Steven's breach of the rules around betting on football and won't be appealing the decision.&quot;We are disappointed at Steven's poor judgement on this issue and have also taken our own internal disciplinary action in line with club policy.&quot;As a club we have reminded all our staff of the rules to which they must adhere and are also reviewing how we educate our employees on their responsibilities both on and off the pitch.&quot;With the hearing now behind us we consider this matter closed and will not be making any further comment at this time.&quot;* Thistle manager Alan Archibald interview page 63

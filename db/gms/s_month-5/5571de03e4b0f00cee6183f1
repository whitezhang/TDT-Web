 “We are now saying publicly that if anybody, civilian or police officer has any information that may assist in finding out what happened on Sunday morning, then we would strongly urge them to come forward and speak to PIRC. 
“If they don’t feel confident contacting PIRC, then we would advise them to contact the family or our office so those details can be provided to the PIRC.”
 

Anwar, a human rights specialist, added: “It is important that they are able to get on with their jobs without people speculating what did and what didn’t happen.
“The next few days are critical. PIRC has assured me that all resources have now been deployed into what is now a major investigation taking place.”

 A BUS depot in Fife is set to close putting 141 jobs at risk. 
Stagecoach East Scotland has announced the planned closure of the Cowdenbeath bus depot following the loss of a number of school and local bus contracts in the West Fife area.
 The announcement follows weeks of consultations regarding the school and local bus contracts awarded by Fife Council . 
Andrew Jarvis, Managing Director, Stagecoach East Scotland said: “It is with deep regret I must formally announce the planned closure of that Cowdenbeath Depot in August.
“This has been a very difficult decision, and we have looked at a number of alternative options, however with such a reduction in the contracts we have been awarded, it is simply not affordable to continue running fewer services while facing the same operating costs. As such, we have unfortunately had to make this regrettable decision in the interests of the long-term future of our business.
“I would like to assure employees that we will be working to re-deploy staff to other local depots and find suitable alternative roles as far as possible.”
A total of 141 staff are based at the Cowdenbeath depot, including 111 drivers.
The company is consulting with trade union representatives over the potential impact on jobs.
Customers have been reassured that all of Stagecoach’s commercial services will continue to operate as normal, from the company’s other depots.
The planned closure is expected to take place at the end of operations on Sunday 16th August 2015.

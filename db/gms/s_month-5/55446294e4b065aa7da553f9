A REMARKABLE woman who has spent her life helping children across the world has been honoured with the British Empire Medal.Flora Glekin began her service to youngsters in the months before the outbreak of World War II when she began visiting children who had been brought to safety in Glasgow.They had been rescued by the Kindertransport, a major humanitarian rescue mission to save Jewish children from the increasing risk of living in countries under Nazi control.Around 10,000 were transported out of Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia in the nine months before the outbreak of war.As a 15-year-old, Flora went on weekly visits with her mother Freda to chat with them and help them learn English.During the meetings, one of the youngsters called Gretl Tiefenbrun revealed she had a brother in danger in Vienna.Flora, who is now 91, recalled: &quot;One of the children told my mother she had a brother who was going to be killed by the Nazis. At that time, if you sent some money you could save a child.&quot;Her mother managed to raise the cash and Gretl's was reunited with Jack in Glasgow.He went on to set up the Textile Engineering Company in 1951 when serviced a diverse range of customers including the massive Singer Sewing Machine Company on he Clyde. Textile Engineering is now the engineering firm Castle Precision.Flora's early involvement with youngsters laid the foundation for more than 70 years helping children.She started work as a teacher in Carnwadric and for the next 30 years specialised in teaching under privileged and special needs children.Flora said: &quot;It was a very poor area and I found so many children deprived in so many ways. Some had learning difficulties and I felt very sorry for them so decided to devote my time to that.&quot;She worked tirelessly for charitable causes including the Women's International Zionist Organisation (WISO) which was committed to helping children across Israel.It helped and sponsored children of all nationalities including Jewish, Christian and Arab.Flora, who was made an honorary life vice-president of WISO worked with the organisation for 60 years raising many thousands of pounds.The British Empire Medal was presented by Glasgow Lord Provost Sadie Docherty in her role as Lord Lieutenant.She said: &quot;It is always a privilege to meet people like Flora and hear their remarkable stories.&quot;It is a compelling and humbling account of a life dedicated to helping children at home and abroad. She is a truly deserving recipient of the British Empire Medal.&quot;The Kindertransport (German for children transport) is a rescue mission that took place during the nine months prior to the outbreak of the Second World War.

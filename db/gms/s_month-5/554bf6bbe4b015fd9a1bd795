Labour has held three seats so far in the 2015 General Election.Results from polling stations across the country are rolling in, with an exit poll suggesting David Cameron looks set to remain Prime Minister with Conservatives the largest single party in the new Parliament - but short of an absolute majority.Labour won the first three seats, but an exit poll has put the Conservatives ahead on 316 seats, with Labour on 239, the Liberal Democrats on 10, the SNP on 58 and Ukip on two.A second exit poll for The Sun - involving a far smaller number of voters - tied Labour and the Tories on 34%, with Ukip on 12%, Lib Dems on 10%, the SNP and Plaid Cymru on 5% and Greens on 4%.A Labour source said Nigel Farage could come third in South Thanet, and there were also Labour fears that shadow chancellor Ed Balls could lose his seat.Page 2: 00:04Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey told Sky News: &quot;We have got two different polls and they are saying very different things, not just about the Liberal Democrat vote but about where Labour and the Tories stand.&quot;What they both say is we are in hung Parliament territory again. If you remember in 2010, the Liberal Democrats put the national interest above party interest. We knew going into coalition would probably hurt us, we would lose some valued colleagues and that may well happen tonight.&quot;But I think it is vital as we get the result in if we get another hung Parliament, that all the parties act in the national interest.&quot;He added: &quot;I'm not pre-judging the outcome of the results. We have to await a lot of result to know if the YouGov poll is better analysis of what is happening than the exit poll.&quot;What is clear from both of them is the Conservatives have not won a majority, yet again they have failed to win a majority.&quot;

A HEAVILY pregnant woman says she is living in fear after a thug slashed the tyres of her car.
Fraserburgh resident Laurianne Ross captured footage of a man slashing the tyres of her mini cooper .
The incident is the third time that her car has been targeted by vandals after it had previously been keyed on every panel and her tyres had also previously been slashed.
But this time she captured the incident on video and it shows a man crouching down near two of the tyres before running down the street.
 

She told the Press and Journal: “All four tyres were done, but the video only shows the last two as it was more clear – to see if anyone knew who it could be,.
“This was third time the car has been vandalised. Back in the middle of April, the car was also keyed on every panel, then there was nothing until the tyres. Two nights in a row they got slashed.
“I can’t, for the life of me, think as to why anyone could be so nasty. I’m due a baby this Friday – for someone to start being so dangerous and evil is beyond me.
“It’s disgusting. This is my first baby, so between trying not to be stressed out about that, I have to deal with living in fear that my car will be damaged in other ways.”
The latest incident happened between 11pm on April 23 and 6am on April 24.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman appealed for people who may have seen the incident to come forward and confirmed inquiries are ongoing.

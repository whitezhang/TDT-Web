CROWDS are expected to flock to Glasgow’s George Square this evening to celebrate the SNP’s stunning general election win.
Nicola Sturgeon led her party to a historic victory at the polls by taking 56 of Scotland’s 59 seats.
The Nats virtually wiped out the Labour Party to completely change the Scottish political landscape.
Now many of the party’s delighted followers are planning to gather in the iconic square to mark the occasion.
A Facebook page titled SNP Celebration George Square is encouraging people to turn up at 7pm to show their support for the election outcome.
 
And Twitter also featured posts backing the event, with one tweet saying: “Looks like there’s a party tonight in George Square.”
A small crowd of SNP supporters has already started to congregate and they have been joined by representatives of the media and police.
When asked if Police Scotland has any specific plans to control the event, a spokesman said: “It will be policed appropriately.”
On the day after the September 2014 independence referendum, rival groups clashed in an around the square.

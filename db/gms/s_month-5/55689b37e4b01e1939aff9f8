A NEW Sheriff has been appointed to run the fatal accident inquiry into the George Square bin lorry crash after it emerged his predecessor knew one of the victims killed in the tragedy.
Sheriff John Beckett will now spearhead the probe which is due to be held on July 22 replacing Sheriff Principal Craig Scott QC.
It is not known which of the six victims Mr Scott knew but a report from the Judiciary of Scotland said he had “since become aware he was acquainted with one of the deceased and is known to their family”.
The statement said: “This was not initially apparent due to the manner in which the deceased was designed in the original application to the court. “
In the circumstances, Sheriff Principal Scott has taken the immediate decision to recuse himself from the inquiry and has appointed Sheriff John Beckett QC to replace him.”

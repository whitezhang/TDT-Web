Couples looking for a farmhouse for group sex sessions have been getting local residents’ knickers in a twist.
The swingers wanting to romp at Caldercuit Farm have been plaguing locals for directions.
They often turn up looking for fun at neighbouring houses – leaving residents red-faced.
Now organisers are pleading with the kinky couples to get it right after a series of complaints.
The &pound;1million farm, near Glasgow’s Maryhill, was bought by Caledonian Property Estates in 2010.
Caroline Bulmer – a 51-year-old ex-Bank of Scotland manager – quit her job to organise sex parties with her partner.
She advertises on an adult website. Single women and couples are given free entry but single men are charged &pound;20.
Sources say as many as 100 men – who are asked to provide identification – turn up for sex.
Party-goers are also encouraged to bring alcohol and use a room which has been turned into a sex dungeon.
One neighbour said: “It’s frustrating when folk turn up looking for a good time and end up asking for directions.”

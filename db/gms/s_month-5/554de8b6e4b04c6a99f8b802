 CELEBRITY make-up expert Craig-Alexander Wilson answered an SOS from  Katie Price after her luggage was delayed before a big night out in Scotland. 
 Katie was flying into Glasgow from Brussels with her man Kieran Hayler for an appearance at Kirkcaldy’s Kittys nightclub when she was left without her make-up and clothes. 

She tweeted: “So angry my first flight of the day and my luggage hasn’t arrived due to the fact the girls checking me not listening and not doing their job.”
Luckily Fake Bake tanning salon expert Craig stepped in to save her skin.
He said: “We often give Katie a spray tan and, when we heard her luggage was missing, we offered to help her out, do her make-up and use the foundation and products I created with Fake Bake – appropriately called Scream and Pout.”
Katie’s luggage arrived just in the nick of time and she made it to Kittys looking as glam as ever.

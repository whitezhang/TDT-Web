Police are becoming &quot;increasingly concerned&quot; for a South Lanarkshire man who was last seen on Wednesday morning.
BT employee Paul Robertson, from Forth, was last seen by a colleague on South Back Road, Biggar, at about 08:40.
He drove off in a white BT Open Reach van with the registration number LD08 XVZ. The van was later spotted on the M8 at Harthill heading east.
Mr Robertson is 47, 5ft 8in tall, slim, with short brown hair, brown eyes and clean shaven with a pale complexion.
Police Scotland said he sometimes wears glasses and was last seen wearing his BT uniform which consists of blue trousers and a blue fleece with the company logo on it. 
He was also wearing orange high-visibility overalls.
Sgt Susan McGinlay said: &quot;This is very out of character for Paul to disappear like this and we are becoming increasingly concerned for his well-being.
&quot;His family and friends are very concerned and ask him to get in touch with someone as soon as possible to let them know he is safe.
&quot;I would urge anyone who recognises Paul's description or has seen the van he was driving to contact police.&quot;

THE TRIAL of Celtic striker Anthony Stokes for an alleged assault on an Elvis impersonator has been adjourned.
Lawyers for the former Sunderland forward said they were ready to proceed with the hearing into an alleged incident in Dublin on June 8 2013.
Judge Patricia Ryan, at Dublin’s Circuit Criminal Court, said she would put the case back for mention before the same court on May 12.
But she said she could not guarantee that it would proceed then.
It is expected the trial will take two days.
The Ireland and Celtic player was in court, dressed in a white shirt, blue tie and grey suit, for the brief hearing.
He has been remanded on bail since last year. 
Stokes, 26, was arrested by appointment and charged with assault causing harm to Anthony Bradley, 42, at Buck Whaley’s nightclub on Leeson Street, Dublin.

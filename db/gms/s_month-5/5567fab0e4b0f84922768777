BY Catriona StewartIT was a sports day with a difference as these primary youngsters took over the Emirates Arena.Some 400 pupils from Elmvale Primary School created their very own Commonwealth Games, based on last year's real thing.Pupils, sports clubs and community members volunteered and raised funds to make sure every child had a chance to try out a raft of sports.And they had a very special visitor - chairman of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games Organising Committee, Michael Cavanagh, who brought with him the Queen's Baton.Yesterday's sport extravaganza at the Emirates Arena was also Mr Cavanagh's last day in his role with pupils thanking him for his contribution to Glasgow 2014.Children from the Springburn school represented a variety of Commonwealth countries, entering the Arena with national flags flying.From nursery to P7, all children were involved and were supported by a variety of volunteer athletes.Pupils tried out 14 different sports on the day, including relay, shot putt, hockey, judo, javelin, netball and table tennis.Teachers said they hope to make the event an annual tradition for the school and the wider Springburn community.

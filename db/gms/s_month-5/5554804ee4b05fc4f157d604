A SERIOUSLY ill grandfather will today have his demands for the right to die heard in Scotland’s highest court.
Gordon Ross wants a judge to issue guidelines over assisted suicide amid confusion over whether someone who helps him would face criminal charges.
The 66-year-old, who currently lives in a Glasgow care home, suffers from Parkinson’s disease and several other conditions which have grown gradually worse.
He has no sensation in his arms or legs, uses a wheelchair because he is unable to walk and can can’t feed or dress himself.
Former TV producer Gordon believes he is being discriminated against as if he wanted to end his own life he would need someone’s assistance which would land them in trouble.
He said: “I believe that, as a disabled person, I am currently being discriminated against. Anyone else, in any circumstances, can choose to end their own lives at any time. Because of my disability that is something I am unable to do.”
He said: “I do not wish to end my life, I want it to go on as long as I can. However, if my condition deteriorates to the point that I do want to take that action, I want to know what action the law might take were someone to assist me.”
His case will be heard today and tomorrow in the Court of Session in Edinburgh with supporters expected to demonstrate outside.
Opponents say a change in the law would devalue suicide prevention efforts.
Gordon, who is unable to attend the hearing, wants the legal position on assisted suicide clarified and is calling for similar guidelines to those which were issued in England where rules on prosecution have been relaxed.
A Scottish Parliament bill on assisted suicide, introduced by the late MSP Margo Macdonald, is currently being looked at.

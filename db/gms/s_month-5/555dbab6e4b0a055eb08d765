GLASGOW WARRIORS will allow Connor Braid to leave the club at the end of this season.
The 24-year-old Canadian international has made seven appearance for the Scotstoun side since arriving on a short-term deal earlier in this campaign.
Braid insists he’s enjoyed his stay with the Warriors and is exiting as a better player.
He said: &quot;I would like to thank everyone at Glasgow Warriors for giving me the opportunity to play and be involved at this great club.
&quot;I have learned a lot in my time here, and will use my experiences as I look to progress in my career.”
Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend insists the back has made a valuable contribution whenever he was called upon.
He said: &quot;We've seen Connor develop hugely over his short spell here and at London Scottish.
&quot;We've called upon his services a number of times throughout the season and he has always stepped up to the plate.
&quot;He is a great person to work with and we hope he continues to prosper and shine wherever he goes.&quot;

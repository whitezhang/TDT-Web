SCOTTISH club legend Mickey Ferrari has died at the age of 29 after battling cancer.
 Mickey – a well-known face on the Glasgow club scene – was diagnosed with liver and lymphatic cancer late last year. 
Friends and family helped raise more than &pound;5700 for his treatment before he passed away this week.
 Yesterday, social media was swamped with tributes to Mickey, who is survived by his eight-year-old son.

 “I will miss you till the day I die my friend and will make sure your party will pay for the wee man’s uni. We all will. RIP  my boss.”

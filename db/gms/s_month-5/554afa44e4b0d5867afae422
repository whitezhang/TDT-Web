NICK Clegg made his last minute bid to hold onto office insisting the LibDems provide stability and insisted he was "brave to enter coalition with the Tories.The LibDem leader was in Scotland completing his journey from Lands End to John O' Groats on the final campaign day.He stopped in Bearsden to help East Dunbartonshire candidate Jo Swinson as she bids to hold off an SNP challenge.Mr Clegg said the country did not need minority government and by entering coalition in 2010 the LibDems put country before party.He said: &quot;We want to do what we think is right for the country. We put the country before our party before - it was the brave thing to do, it was the right thing to do - and we would do it again.&quot;That contrasts with the attitude of David Cameron and Ed Miliband who are still seeking to claim that they are going to win a majority when they know they are not and are in real danger of sleepwalking towards a messy, unstable, minority government which is basically held captive by the extremes on right and left.&quot;That is not what our country needs.&quot;Mr Clegg faces a huge battle to retain MPs and even his own seat in Sheffield is under threat.The opinion polls have the LibDems on single figures trailing Nigel Farage's Ukip and their position as the third largest party under threat from the SNP if they achieve the predicted number of seats.Mr Clegg warned Labour and the Tories the LibDems would not support any government that involved wither the SNP or Ukip and would refuse a deal if it was not right for Britain.He said: &quot;You should never, in politics or in life, want to cling on to power for power's sake.&quot;Predictions of electoral disaster as voters took revenge for the coalition deal and u turn on tuition fees were dismissed by Mr Clegg .He said: &quot;At the beginning of this campaign we were written off and yet tomorrow, when the polls close, the Liberal Democrats will be the surprise story of this General Election campaign because we are going to win.&quot;

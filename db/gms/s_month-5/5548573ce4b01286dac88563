SMOKING rates among 12-year-olds in Glasgow dropped by more than half when children of the same age explained the risks.A new Glasgow project, where second year pupils are trained to help persuade others to quit, is to double in size.Young people were nominated for the role by pupils, to help ensure they had some influence over their peers.Smoking is responsible for more than 11,000 deaths worldwide daily and the largest single cause of preventable illness in the UK.However, despite the number of adult smokers falling over the last decade, the number of teenage smokers has risen.Glasgow was chosen by the Scottish Government as the pilot for a new project run by NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHSGGC) and Glasgow City Council (GGC) across 10 secondary schools.A total of 137 second year pupils, in schools with higher rates of smoking, were nominated by fellow pupils as 'peer supporters'.Over the last three recorded years, smoking figures have more than halved amongst 13-year-olds in Glasgow.In the years 2010-13, 2% of Glasgow 13-year-olds were regular smokers compared to 5% in the previous three years.Schools taking part included Springburn Academy, Lochend High School, John Paul Academy, Hillpark Secondary School and Shawlands Academy.The scheme is now being extended to five other schools including Knightswood Secondary.Jenna Fraser, 13, from Knightswood, who is training to be a peer educator, said: &quot;If it's someone your own age you listen.&quot;Alan Little, 13, said he was shocked to discover how many chemicals are in cigarettes.Melanie Owens, ASSiST programme co-ordinator, NHSGGC, said: &quot;Despite the drop in the number of adults in Greater Glasgow and Clyde smoking over the last decade it has still been responsible for approximately 12,000 deaths in the last three years.&quot;It's important to reach young people at an early stage to prevent them from starting smoking which is the aim of the trial.&quot;The schools chosen to participate were selected based on smoking rates.&quot;It is important the pupils are nominated by their peers as they already have credibility and influence with their own group at school.&quot;Our aim is that this is reflected in a further decrease in the number of 13 year olds smoking.&quot;Councillor Stephen Curran, executive member for education and young people, Glasgow City Council, said: &quot;Our young people strive to be responsible citizens and the majority want to live a healthy lifestyle.&quot;

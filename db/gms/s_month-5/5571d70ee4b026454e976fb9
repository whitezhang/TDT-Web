A FAMILY firm behind an exclusive chain of hotels has submitted a &pound;160 million bid to buy Gleneagles.
The world famous venue, which hosted last year’s Ryder Cup, went on the market in January.
Drinks giant Diageo, which has owned the establishment since 1984, said it hoped to make more than &pound;200 million from the sale of the 232-bedroom hotel and its 850-acre estate.
Now the Ralph Trustees, which runs the prestigious Athenaeum Hotel in London, has put forward a bid to take over the hotel.
It is understood the company, controlled by brothers Daniel and Stuart Levy, is hoping to strike a deal before rival suitors KSL Capital Partners, an American private equity firm that owns the former Ryder Cup venue the Belfry, near Birmingham.
 

The Colorado-based company reportedly submitted an offer of &pound;150m.
Both Diageo and Ralph Trustees remained tight-lipped about the bids.
Diageo, which makes Johnnie Walker whiskey and Smirnoff vodka among others, put Gleneagles on the market after the success of the Ryder Cup last September.
A spokesman said previously: “We are sure there are many people who would love to own Gleneagles and have received numerous expressions of interest over the years and particularly since the Ryder Cup.”

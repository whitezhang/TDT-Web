AN IRISHMAN living in Edinburgh recorded his epic journey home after realising at the last minute that he was eligible to vote in the gay marriage referendum.
Damian McGlynn who supports same sex marriage had been urging people from his home country to vote yes. However at the last minute, Damian realised that despite living in Scotland, he was still able to vote.

After checking with his mum in Tallaght, Dublin, he was assured that his polling cards was waiting for him.
 
Damian then left work to begin his race home and live-tweeted to thousands along the way.
 
Just goes to show it pays to call your mother often. &quot;Sure your polling card is in the hall with the others&quot;.

After a nail-biting plane delay, he arrived at the polling station with just one hour to spare.
 
On Saturday afternoon as a Yes vote was predicted, Damien said: &quot;Today is going to be an emphatic win for marriage equality. Tomorrow we can get to work on treating everyone else more fairly.&quot;

As thousands headed to polling stations, #hometovote trended on Twitter as Irish expats returned to their country to vote in the historic referendum.

 

Gourmet Burger Kitchen will be selling the new shakes which are made using one milk chocolate Tunnock's Caramel Wafer bar.
The classic confectionery item, created by Uddingston-based Tunnock's, will be blended with salted caramel ice cream before being served in a steel tin container.
 

 
The perfect combination of chocolate and nostalgia have seen the Scottish firm surpass &pound;40million sales with high demand for tasty teacakes and crispy wafers since 1912.
And now life has never been sweeter with a brand new Tunnockâ€™s creation on offer at the popular burger joint.
The new shake, called the Tunnock's Caramel Wafer Milkshake, will be available exclusively in Gourmet Burger Kitchen restaurants in Glasgow and Edinburgh.

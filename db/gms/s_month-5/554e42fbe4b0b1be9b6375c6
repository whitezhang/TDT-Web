 Queens team news to follow. 
  Queen of the South manager James Fowler:  &quot;We don't fear anybody and I think we have shown that throughout the season. 
 &quot;Even though Hearts won the four games against us we competed well against them and obviously we have had good results against Hibs and Rangers as well. 
 &quot;We have shown that we can hurt Rangers, so we are just looking for the same again really. 
 &quot;We know it is going to be tough. It is a two-legged tie and it is important that we give ourselves a chance going into the second leg. 
 &quot;The spirit and attitude of the players has been key this season. 
 &quot;Rangers are still a massive club, they still have international players in their squad. 
 &quot;We know it is going to be a big ask over the two legs but we have players who can trouble them.&quot; 
  Rangers defender Richard Foster:  &quot;These next two games are right up there with the biggest games I've ever played in terms of importance. 
 &quot;It's massive for us. We know the consequences if we don't get through this tie and go on to promotion. 
 &quot;So it's right up there with the most important I've played in. That brings with it its own nervousness but also its own excitement. 
 &quot;I've played in a few big games during my first spell at the club. We had to beat Kilmarnock on the final day of the season to win the title the last time I was at the club but I was on the bench that game and never played. 
 &quot;So the biggest I've tasted was probably the goalless Old Firm game a few weeks before where Allan McGregor saved that Georgios Samaras penalty. 
 &quot;That was the most important game of that season - looking back you can see how massive a save was for us that year going for the title. 
 &quot;The crowd won't be that big on Saturday but that's the league that we are in. Queen of the South did well to get into the play-offs. It doesn't matter how big the stadium is, the level of importance is very high. 
 &quot;I don't think the fans would accept us going down there and playing for a 0-0. That's very hard to do anyway. Inevitably you lose a goal then have to change your whole mindset. 
 &quot;We'll be looking to win the game. Obviously we want to keep it tight but I think we are a better team when we are on the front foot.&quot;

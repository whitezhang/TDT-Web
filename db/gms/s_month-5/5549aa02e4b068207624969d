By Ann FotheringhamWATCHING her dad cope with Parkinson's Disease inspired Nicola Pope to change her own life.The Giffnock mum shed five and a half stones and took up running - and now she is heading for Millport to help raise funds for a cause close to her heart.The Millport 10-miler, a walk or run around the isle of Cumbrae on May 9, is organised by Michael's Movers, a charity set up by Evening Times Scotswoman of the Year finalist Maria Righetti.Maria's husband Michael was diagnosed with Parkinson's in his 30s, and since then, almost 24 years ago, she has dedicated her life to raising funds for research and support.&quot;Michael's Movers means a lot to me as it has helped my mum and dad enormously,&quot; says Nicola.&quot;My dad, Edward, was diagnosed 17 years ago when he was 51, and it was a big shock to us all. Every day is a challenge for him - he can't walk very well, and it's the little things he finds most frustrating, like not being able to tie his own tie.&quot;Parkinson's disease affects the brain, which becomes progressively damaged over many years leading to tremors, slow movement and inflexible muscles.Nicola adds: &quot;It's hard for my dad because he has to rely on my mum for so much, and he was always very independent.&quot;We had no idea what Parkinson's was until it came into our lives and it's been hard on my mum, my brother and I, to see my dad changing.&quot;Your life turns upside down, it's a very difficult disease to manage.&quot;But my dad is great - he is incredibly positive and Michael's Movers makes a huge difference.&quot;Michael's Movers raises funds for research into the disease in Scotland, and Maria, who has two grown-up daughters, runs a monthly Monday club on top of her own busy life as a personal trainer.&quot;Maria is an amazing person - she is super-busy and while she never has time for herself, she always has time for everyone else,&quot; smiles Nicola.&quot;The Monday club is a fantastic place - my mum and dad enjoy it because everyone who goes understands what it's like to live with Parkinson's.&quot;Nicola laughs that she is &quot;not really a runner&quot;, but she is determined to do the Millport 10-miler after training hard all year.&quot;My husband is doing it too - he's planning to run round the island twice, but once is enough for me,&quot; she grins.&quot;It's a big family effort on the day though - my mum and dad, and our daughters Sophie, 8, and Lucy, 5, will all be helping out at the water stations and I'm doing my run earlier on so I can get back to help with registrations and supporting the runners around the course.&quot;To enter the Millport 10-miler, on May 9, visit www.michaelsmovers.org.

A 50-year-old man who wielded a machete during a &pound;40,000 armed robbery in North Lanarkshire in 2009 has died in prison.
William MacKenzie was part of a masked gang that targeted security guards as they delivered cash to an ATM at a Spar store in Drumgelloch, Airdrie.
He was identified from CCTV footage and jailed for seven years in 2011.
The Scottish Prison Service said MacKenzie's family had been told that he died at Addiewell Prison in West Lothian on Wednesday. 
Police have been informed and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
A fatal accident inquiry will be held in due course.

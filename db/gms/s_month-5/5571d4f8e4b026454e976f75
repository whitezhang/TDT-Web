A BOY was taken to hospital and several other people were hurt after a bogie race cart plunged down a steep hill.
The crash happened during the annual Borders Bogie Challenge near Denholm, Roxburghshire, on Saturday.
Welsh driver Steve Pritchard crashed through barriers as he headed downhill at speed and ploughed into a number of adults and children.
They were trreated at the scene for cuts and one boy was taken to Borders General Hospital near Melrose after suffering a minor injury but was later released.
A spokesman for Borders Bogies issued a statement on its Facebook page, saying: “All the people that were injured and seen by ambulance crews are all okay.
&quot;Sore and some fantastic bruises and some good stories to tell on Monday. Big thanks to all the Border Bogies First Aiders - all ten of them - our marshals and the two local residents both of whom have just completed their updated first aid course.
“Also the local householder who let everybody in to their house so they could be checked over by us then the four paramedics and the air ambulance. So sorry to have had to cancel the event but we decided due to the number of people on the course either injured or responding it was unsafe to carry on.
“Will keep you all updated on where Border Bogies goes from here.”
A spokesman for the Scottish Ambulance Service said: ‘We transported one patient to Borders General Hospital.’

PATIENTS have slammed a former surgeon who has gone &quot;on a jolly” to Copacabana Beach in Brazil while they lie bed-ridden.
Professor Muftah Salem Eljamel remained on the International Photo-dynamic Association (IPA) board of directors despite being suspended from his post last year after a patient underwent surgery on the wrong spinal disc.
The surgeon is due to address guests at Saturday’s opening ceremony of the 15th IPA World Congress at the five-star Belmond Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro.
But it has now emerged that the IPA did not know about his suspension, writes the Courier.
IPA treasurer and director Carolyn Cross said: “This information is not known to me and likely others on the board.
“We will take up this matter next week when the board meets as a group.”
 

Mr Eljamel, who was a consultant neurological surgeon in Tayside from 1995, was suspended from his post last year.
He also had to step down from his teaching posts at Dundee University following the interim order by the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service, before retiring from the NHS.
Former Dundee radio DJ Patrick Kelly is leading calls for a public inquiry after claiming he was the victim of a “botched operation” in 2007 by Mr Eljamel.
Since then many more people have come forward to say they were also left with long-term health problems following surgery by Mr Eljamel.
Patrick said: “I simply cannot believe that this man, who has left a trail of misery and destruction, can simply skip off on a jolly to the Copacabana Beach.
“People are unable to walk, bed ridden and in chronic pain each day while he can travel the world giving medical talks while he is still suspended in the UK.”

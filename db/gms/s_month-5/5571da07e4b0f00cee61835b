 CORRUPT council officials were treated to dances and drinks in lap-dancing bars as lucrative contracts were secured through bribery, a court heard yesterday. 
 Edinburgh Council employees Charles Owenson and James Costello were provided with hospitality by Edinburgh-based building firm ABC Ltd, including corporate seats at Hibs and Hearts football grounds. 
The contractors even submitted inflated invoices to the local authority to cover the cost of the bribes.
Fiscal Keith O’Mahony told Edinburgh Sheriff Court: “In essence, the council was being charged for the cost of bribing its own officials.”
Owenson, 62, and Costello, 44, both of Edinburgh, have admitted corruption and proceeds of crime offences. Both have been dismissed.
Former ABC directors Kevin Balmer, 52, and Brendan Cantwell, 44, of Livingston, also admitted corruption.
Sheriff Michael O’Grady QC ordered the preparation of background reports ahead of sentencing.

THE 2015 General Election campaign was one of the most uplifting I have ever been involved in.
I was joined by hundreds of volunteer activists the length and breadth of the big, beautiful and diverse constituency of Fife North East. SNP Membership jumped from 200 in September to 1600 bringing volunteers brimming with fresh ideas and energy.
They helped me cover more ground and reach more voters than ever before and tap into their vast pool of expertise, skills and raw enthusiasm.
That was a humbling experience and has left me grateful for their heroic efforts. It is often forgotten that democracy would come to a stand-still if not for these volunteers from all parties who make campaigns.
This will not be forgotten as I take forward my new job of MP for North East Fife.
I owe it to every volunteer to do the best I can and repay their hard work.
Even more importantly I need to be the best constituency MP I can be for every one of my constituents in Fife North East, regardless of how they voted. That will be my absolute number one priority.
That means making sure that they have a strong voice at Westminster.
That means more powers so that we can help small and medium sized businesses to thrive.
It also means fighting to bring an end to austerity that hits our economy and the most vulnerable.
Voting against wasting &pound;100billion on new nuclear weapons we donâ€™t need and against allowing Westminster to isolate Scotland by taking us out of Europe.
The people of North East Fife and Scotland have spoken clearly that we need to give Scotland a Stronger voice at Westminster and I intend to do just that.
 Stephen Gethins is the MP for Fife North East

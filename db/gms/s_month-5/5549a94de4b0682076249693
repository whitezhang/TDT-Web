RESEARCHERS are investigating a problem which causes multiple sclerosis patients problems with walking.Around 75% of people with the condition have difficulties walking, with foot drop one of the main symptoms, resulting in tripping and an increased risk of falls.Linda Miller, a consultant physiotherapist in MS with Glasgow Caledonian University is leading a study to compare treatments for the walking difficulty.She is working along with Danny Rafferty from Glasgow Caledonian and Dr Lorna Paul from Glasgow University on the research which is funded by the MS Society.The trial, which will run until 2016, will compare the different treatments for their effects on walking speed, fatigue, quality of life and cost-effectiveness.The results will inform the decisions commissioners and clinicians make regarding the treatments that should be made available.At the end of the project all participants will be invited to a focus group which will explore their experiences of using the two treatments.

HUNDREDS of tributes have been paid to tragic stock car racer Keir Millar.
A Facebook page set up to the memory of the popular 11-year-old received 14,000 likes by last night as the world of motorsport and beyond was touched by his loss.
The up-and-coming star – son of stock car racer Keith “Mad Max” Millar – was badly hurt during a race in Lochgelly, Fife, on Saturday.
He died from his injuries later in hospital.
Last night, Keir’s family said: “We are extremely distraught at the passing of our son.
“He was a much-loved son and brother and will be sadly missed by all who knew him.
“The family are requesting privacy at this most difficult time.”
Keir was famous in the world of Ministox and won the Ninja Kart Championship in Ipswich last year.
 

Among the tributes on Facebook was one from Jay Adair Motorsport Photography, who wrote: “You can be a racer, a marshal, pit crew, a photographer, a spectator and many other things in motorsport but, at the end of the day, we are one big family and we all feel it when we lose one of our own. RIP wee champion.”
Keir’s brother Brandon posted a touching message on Facebook after finding a loom band made by his brother, which he pledged to wear forever.
He wrote: “I’m cleaning stuff up at home and find this, this is his last loom band he made, as he left all the mess out.
“I will always wear this with pride and you will always be with me now.
“Miss you so much wee man, sleep right my angel.”
 

Tribute T-shirts showing Keir’s face are to be sold at the weekend, with proceeds going to a charity fund.
Tributes will be made at various events around the country, including a minute’s silence at the Arena Essex Speedway on Sunday.

SCOTS music legend Rod Stewart has put his backing behind to two musical sisters who penned a song in memory of their friend.Twins Brittany and Rachelle Davies, both 15, were astounded when the Handbags and Gladrags star tweeted his support for the pair and encouraged his fans to buy their first single.The rock star, who has more than 217,000 followers on the social media site, wrote: &quot;A pleasure to see young talent giving back. Purchase Glasgow's @Rach_Britt's first single and support YoungMinds UK.&quot;The sisters had contacted Rod by email and after launching their song on iTunes.Their dad Derek said: &quot;We couldn't believe it when we saw the tweet. We are really grateful to Rod for supporting them and we hope it will raise the song's profile and help more people.&quot;As reported in the Evening Times, Britanny wrote Shout Out in memory of her and Rachelle's friend Heather, who tragically took her own life last year.They wanted to raise awareness of the problems young people face, encouraging others to speak up if they are having difficulties.Any profits from the sale of the tune will be donated to the YoungMinds charity, which supports young people with mental health problems.

  Quinn 118â€²  
 Tony Quinn scored late in extra time to send Queen's Park into the League One play-off final against Stenhousemuir. 
 Following a 2-2 draw at Gayfield, the return at Hampden was a cagey affair and goalless after 90 minutes. 
 With two minutes left of extra time, Quinn found the bottom corner with a shot from Sean Burns' floated corner. 
 The Red Lichties did have chances to grab an away win in normal time but Scott McBride headed over the crossbar and Craig Johnstone fired wide.

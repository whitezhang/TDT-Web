 CYCLISTS rode to the rescue after a man was caught trying to rape a teenage girl. 
 Ryan Douglas was jailed for six years yesterday for the terrifying random attack on the 17-year-old. 
 Judge Paul Arthurson praised passers-by who came to her aid after hearing screams and two cyclists who chased Douglas. 
Douglas, 25, assaulted the girl as she walked in Irvine, Ayrshire, in August last year.
He grabbed her neck, put her in a headlock and pulled her by the hair into bushes.
The teenager fought back by kicking, hitting and scratching her attacker.
Christine Herman, who was out with her young son, heard her screaming and shouting: “Help me, help me, somebody please help me.”
She saw Douglas pushing the victim against a tree with his arm around her neck.
The teenager, whose clothes were covered in mud, said: “Please help me. I don’t know this man.”
But Douglas claimed: “She’s only joking. It’s just a joke.”
Another passer-by dialled 999, prompting Douglas to let go of his victim and flee.
Yvonne Lynch, urged a passing cyclist, Peter Collier, to chase after Douglas.
Mr Collier and fellow cyclist Gavin McGrath spotted Douglas at an underpass.
Mr Collier grabbed him but the attacker managed to break free and escaped.
Douglas was arrested the following day at a house in Irvine, where police found him hiding under a pile of clothes in a wardrobe.
He previously admitted assaulting and attempting to rape the teenager.
Frances Connor, defending, said Douglas was sorry and claimed he had no memory of the attack, which happened after he had been drinking.
Judge Paul Arthurson told Douglas at the High Court in Edinburgh: “But for the highly commendable and courageous actions from members of the public I have no doubt you would have continued with that attack.”

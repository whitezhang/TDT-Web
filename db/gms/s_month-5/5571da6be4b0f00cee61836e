ARMED police could save lives because of their additional medical training, the Scottish Police Authority has said.
The SPA says the officers can provide back-up for paramedics because of their training and expertise.
It says the extra training given to armed officers means they can intervene if they see someone in need of help.
The comments come after yet another photograph was published of officers with sidearms going about routine business.
 Two policemen were seen with sidearms walking in to a supermarket in Stirling . 
It is the latest picture which seems to suggest Police Scotland chief constable Sir Stephen House has fallen short on his pledge to have armed police responding only to incidents where there is danger to life.
That came after armed police were snapped in Inverness and Glasgow city centre responding to low grade incidents.
An SPA spokesman told the Scottish Daily Mail: “Police Scotland has set out clearly and publicly the approach expected of armed response vehicle (ARV) officers in such circumstances.
&quot;The SPA supports the principle these highly-trained officers use their professional judgment and discretion while going about their duties and we are reassured that the regular guidance and training provided to these officers is appropriate to support them in assessing a range of different situations.”
 

The SPA is the body which oversees policing in Scotland.
It has faced criticism over claims it has failed to hold the police to account.
Police Scotland has said that in February in Dalbeattie Forest, Dumfriesshire, a woman “who had suffered a serious injury after a mountain bike fall was recovered by armed officers who used the 4x4 capability of their vehicle and their first-aid skills as the nearest responders to the incident.”

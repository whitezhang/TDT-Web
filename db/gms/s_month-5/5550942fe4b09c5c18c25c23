AN AMERICAN chef sparked outrage after describing Glasgow as a place you go for "a beer and a beating."Anthony Bourdain made the disparaging comments after taking a trip to the city for a new CNN documentary Parts Unknown.He later said he adores the city and urged viewers to watch the film before forming their own opinions.In the trailer he said Glaswegians are known to have more fun at funeral than Edinburghers do at a wedding, but added: &quot; That does invite from time to time admittedly a fair amount of knuckle-headed behaviours.&quot;If you're looking for a beer and a beating Glasgow will happily provide it.&quot;The film crew then captured a group of men scrapping on Sauchiehall street on camera, while Mr Bourdain continued to narrate: &quot;Access to guns is extremely difficult here so Scottish hoodlums - unable to dispatch their victims with the kind of speed and efficiency as we enjoy in the good old USA - has had traditionally had to resort to the knife to do its maiming and killing.&quot;Locals took to Twitter to express their dismay, blasting the documentary as &quot;rubbish&quot;.Drew Chalmers wrote: &quot;Just watched some idiot chef Anthony Bourdain portray Glasgow on CNN.&quot;What rubbish...Should stick to making pies for all he knows about here.&quot;Another Twitter user Penny Watson said: &quot;I'm still irked about the ridiculous Anthony Bourdain show that was on last night about Scotland.&quot;Others quizzed Mr Bourdain on his true opinion of the city on the social networking site, asking him whether the &quot;beer and a beating&quot; line had been a PR stunt.The celebrity chef replied it was &quot;B******t&quot; and added: &quot; Watch the show itself rather than this lame, disingenuous characterization. Adore Glasgow.&quot;

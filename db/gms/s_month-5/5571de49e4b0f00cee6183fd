SCOTLAND’S flagship new hospital ran out of water just days after admitting its first patients.
Inpatients, who were only transferred at the weekend, were left without hot or cold water in the new South Glasgow University Hospital.
Relatives revealed on Monday that patients at the &pound;842million super-hospital were unable to shower or wash their hands.
Yesterday, Scottish Labour’s health spokeswoman Jenny Mara insisted that the issues should have been resolved before doors opened to the public.
She said: “Most people would have expected these teething problems to have been dealt with prior to patients being admitted.
“We were promised a state-of-the-art facility for the taxpayers’ investment but patients going without running water and being handed drinking bottles falls some way short of this.”
A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde admitted there had been “teething” problems with the water supply.
She said: “The migration of inpatients went very smoothly and we would like to thank all our staff involved.
“However, as with any new building of this magnitude, we experienced a teething issue which caused a problem with our water supply.
“We would like to apologise to inpatients that this has occurred and hope to have any issues resolved as soon as possible.”
A Scottish Government spokesman added: “We have been assured by the health board that temporary measures were put in place and that the storage tanks have been filled and normal supplies resumed.”

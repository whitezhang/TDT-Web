Police have launched an attempted murder investigation after one man was stabbed and another injured during disturbances in Helensburgh.
Police said the men, aged 20 and 25, were involved in an &quot;altercation&quot; in Old Luss Road at about 18:30 on Sunday.
They were also involved in an earlier incident around the Argyll town's Drumfork Court and Buchanan Road areas. 
It is not yet known if anyone else was involved. Both men are said to be in a stable condition in hospital.
One of them is being treated at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow. The other is in Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital.
Police said they were treating the incidents as attempted murder and had been gathering CCTV images in an effort to establish the exact circumstances of the attack.
Det Sgt Lesley Irons said: &quot;We know that the two men were involved in an altercation but what's not completely clear is how they came about their injuries. 
&quot;That's why we are appealing to anyone who may have seen anything or who may have any knowledge of the incident.&quot;

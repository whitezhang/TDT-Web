DAVID Findlay disappeared seven years ago - but his daughter still hasn't given up hope of finding him alive.As she appealed for help in finding her father, Linda Findlay insisted that she was clinging to the hope that he is still alive.Refusing to talk about her dad in the past tense, the 50-year-old said: &quot;I'm hopeful that one day we will meet again.&quot;I will never give up - my Dad is out there somewhere.&quot;Pensioner David, who lived in Cardonald, on the South Side of Glasgow, was 68-years-old when he went missing.On May 5 2008, he left his home to go for a walk.Hours later, Linda received a phone call from her son. &quot;Grandad hasn't come home&quot;, he said.She immediately knew something was very wrong.David, who had early signs of Alzheimer's, didn't come home that night. He was never seen again.Anguished Linda said: &quot;We just miss him terribly.&quot;With each year that passes, it doesn't get easier. It gets harder.&quot;My family are living in limbo and it's the not knowing that is worst.&quot;Linda said she was tormented by always hoping and looking for her dad, but also by never being able to say goodbye.She added: &quot;He has missed birthdays and Christmases, every milestone he has missed.&quot;His 75th birthday, my 50th birthday, he's missed them all.&quot;It is just a total mystery and you don't know what to think.&quot;Someone out there must be out there somewhere, we just need that tiny piece of information that will help us find out where he is.&quot;Although Linda has not given up hope, there are times when she fears the worst.She added: &quot;When you hear on the news, or read in the paper, that human remains or a body has been found, my heart really goes.&quot;I start to wonder, could it be Dad?&quot;And if he has passed away, we still don't know and still can't grieve.&quot;I will never give up hope, as long as we don't know either way, I have to believe he is out there.&quot;During the past seven years David's family have searched for him everywhere, including homeless shelters.When last seen, he was wearing grey trousers, a brown suede jacket, a grey jumper with white and red stripes and black shoes.The retired labourer also has two sons, David, and Stephen, and five grandchildren.David enjoys long walks - sometimes going as far afield as Clydebank and Saltcoats.He would also walk around the Barras.Linda added: &quot;If someone sees a photo of Dad and recognises him, I would urge them to contact police&quot;All we can do is continue to hope.&quot;

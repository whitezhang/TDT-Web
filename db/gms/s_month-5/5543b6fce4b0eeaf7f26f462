Controversial plans to scrap controlled crossings at a busy road junction as part of Scotland's first &quot;shared space&quot; system have been watered down.
East Dunbartonshire Council wanted to change the Catherine Street junction in Kirkintilloch and remove traffic lights, barriers, kerbs and crossings.
This &quot;shared space&quot; plan, where traffic and pedestrians share right of way, is aimed at improving safety. 
Following protests from local people, controlled crossing are to be kept.
Council leader Rhondda said: &quot;We recognise and accept that there have been a range of views and a number of concerns expressed by members of the community and groups over the past few months.
&quot;We want to reassure people that we have listened and that work has been ongoing to address those anxieties - to reach a compromise that will help achieve the goals of the master plan while also addressing the legitimate concerns of our citizens.
&quot;We feel the amended proposals recognise and address those concerns - ensuring controlled crossings remain in place for anyone requiring additional reassurance in using the reshaped junction - allowing a period of awareness-raising and education to take place with the wider community.&quot;

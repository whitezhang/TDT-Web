THE son of murdered pensioner Jenny Methven said he will never get over her senseless death.
And David Methven said he feels betrayed by the friend who killed his mum in February 2012 and then blamed him for the horrific crime.
Last week in a civil case at the Court of Session William Kean was ordered to pay him more than &pound;86,000 in compensation.
David told the Mail on Sunday: “This has been like a nightmare I can never wake up from.
“My mother’s death was raw then and it is still raw now.
“I have flashbacks all the time.”
David found mum Jenny, 80, slumped in a chair in the kitchen of their home in Forteviot, Perthshire with a bloodstained towel over her head.
He initially thought she had been involved in an accident but it later emerged she had been struck at least 11 times with a blunt object.
Kean, 50, was later jailed for life and ordered to spend 22 years behind bars.
But David, 61, said the killer compounded his agony by refusing to accept blame and claiming during the murder trial that he had had a role in his own mother’s death.
He said: “I felt betrayed, absolutely shocked that anybody could do that.
“I had lost my mother and there I was being accused and implicated in her death by somebody who was supposedly a family friend.
“After what happened I would have to say that anybody is capable of anything.
“I didn’t even get the chance to say goodbye.”

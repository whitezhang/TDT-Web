WHEN it opened its doors on May 1, 1975, the creators of the Third Eye Centre had no idea that over the years it would not just become a haven for like-minded people to gather and share ideas but bring the best of modern art into the lives of local people.The radical poet, playwright and musician Tom McGrath was behind the revolutionary arts centre that over the years hosted exhibitions and performances by the likes of Ivor Cutler, Billy Connolly and John Byrne and where polymath Alasdair Gray launched his landmark novel Lanark.The Sauchiehall Street venue became the CCA in 1992 and now current director Francis McKee is working with a team to trawl through the archives and piece together its history.&quot;When the Third Eye was here in the 1970s, there was nothing like that in the city. They were all really young and started working and then would move onto the next thing, and 40 years later no-one has archived it and no-one can remember what they did,&quot; he said.&quot;We are going back and trying to make sense of that and then using it to help us. That has reconnected us to that early spirit of the Third Eye, and that has been helpful in regenerating the building.&quot;He adds: &quot;We have founds loads of things I wasn't expecting, like footage of the Allen Ginsburg visit, which I had always heard about like some urban legend but to actually find there was three hours of film ... that's such a gift.&quot;They are still working through the years of the 1970s, uncovering posters, flyers, photographs and film footage.Film and video has been digitised and some of it can now be seen on the CCA website.The people of Glasgow are proving to be a great resource, filling in the gaps with information and identifying people and events in old pictures.Meanwhile the archive in turn inspires future arts programmes at CCA.&quot;We've been trying to go back to the ethos of the very early days of the Third Eye Centre. Having the archive we can see how that formulated itself,&quot; he said.Visit www.CCA-glasgow.com

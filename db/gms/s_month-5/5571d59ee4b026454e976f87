A KIND-HEARTED pensioner has donated dozens of flowers to a primary school garden hit by vandals.
On Friday, we told how two 10-year-old boys went on a wrecking spree at the gardening club at St Paul’s Primary in Paisley.
Pupils were left devastated when they arrived on Wednesday and found their fruit and veg patches had been torn up and plant pots shattered.
The youngsters had spent 18 months creating the playground project.
But now a green-fingered OAP is to give them part of his collection of fuchsias and geraniums to replaced the destroyed plants.
Widower John Logan, 84, made the offer after reading the story in the Record.
The retired BT worker, from Cambusbarron, near Stirling, said: “I’ve been reading the Daily Record for years now and I would never change from that.
“When I read about the vandalism and these bairns in Paisley, my heart felt for them when I saw the damage that had been done.
“I’m a great one for fuchsias and geraniums and I had a surplus.”
Big-hearted bosses at the Braehead shopping centre have also stepped in to help repair the garden.
General manager Gary Turnbull said: “It’s hard to believe that people could be so cruel as to vandalise a garden that has been created and worked on by primary school kids.
“We’ll make sure the youngsters have a garden they will be delighted with and we’ll repair the damage and replace any vegetables, plants and flowers that have been destroyed.”

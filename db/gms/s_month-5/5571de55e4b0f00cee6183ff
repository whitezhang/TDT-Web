A NURSERY nurse who told a three-year-old to “f*** off” has been banned from working with children.
Joanne White was struck off after the Scottish Social Services Council heard how she lost the plot while working at the Step by Step children’s nursery in Livingston in 2013.
She swore at one child and a boy fell over when she threw a cushion at him, the hearing was told.
White, who had been a nursery nurse for 15 years, admitted the charge and misconduct. She consented to her name being removed from the register.
In their ruling, the council stated: “Social services workers have a responsibility for being role models for acceptable behaviour. She breached the trust and confidence that is placed in her by service users and their carers.
“Her behaviour was violent and aggressive and represented a loss of self-control.”

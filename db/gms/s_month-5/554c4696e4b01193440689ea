The SNP also claimed the seat of UK business minister Jo Swinson, who lost the East Dunbartonshire seat she had held for the Liberal Democrats since 2005.
Former nationalist leader and former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said it looked like his party would win a ‘’very large number’’ of seats.
Mr Salmond, who is hoping to win the Gordon seat, told the BBC: ‘’The winds are blowing across Scotland and they’re blowing very strongly, believe me, in the north east of Scotland.
‘’There’s going to be a lion roaring tonight, a Scottish lion, and it’s going to roar with a voice that no government of whatever political complexion is going to be able to ignore.
‘’I think it’s going to be a resounding voice, a clear voice, a united voice from Scotland, and I think that is a very good thing.’’
He said there was an ‘’electoral tsunami’’ in Scotland
Mr Salmond told ITV that if the exit polls, which predict the SNP securing all but one seat in Scotland, were correct, ‘’it certainly leaves David Cameron, if that were the case, with no legitimacy whatsoever up in Scotland”.

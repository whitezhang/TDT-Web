STREETS Ahead spring cleaning continues all over the city, thanks to local schoolkids and Clean Glasgow.Our campaign partner teamed up with schools, volunteers and McDonald's staff to collect 33 bags of rubbish in a litter-pick near Govanhill Park.Pupils from Cuthbertson Primary, Annette Street Primary and Holy Cross Primary schools took part in the event.The litter pick was the latest in a series of spring clean events in the south side of the city organised by Clean Glasgow, who are our campaign partners in Streets Ahead alongside Glasgow Housing Association, Scottish Fire and Rescue, City Charitable Trust and ScotRail.Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairperson of Clean Glasgow, said: &quot;It's great that our young people are getting involved in helping to make their city look its best.&quot;It's also fantastic that as well as our local volunteers, a business like McDonald's is prepared to help lead by example.&quot;It's another great example of a community working together.&quot;If everyone plays their part we can ensure that Glasgow is a clean and safe environment - not only for visitors to our city, but just as importantly for the people who live here.&quot;Local McDonald's Operations Consultant, Victoria Mitchell, said: &quot;It was great to see everyone come together to take action against litter.&quot;When local businesses and community members work together we are able to achieve so much more and this event is a perfect example of this.&quot;Information on how residents and businesses can get help to organise their own community clean-ups is available on www.cleanglasgow.comFor more information about the Evening Times Streets Ahead campaign, visit www.eveningtimes.co.uk

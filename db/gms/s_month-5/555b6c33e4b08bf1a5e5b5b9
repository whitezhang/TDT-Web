A CLASSIFIED ad has appeared on listings website Gumtree cutting through the employment jargon in the search for staff who cut mustard.. Literally.
The owner of an American Diner opening in the south of Glasgow, calling himself Justin, pulled us in straight away with his listing titled &quot;Looking for someone fast, progressive, and not a total **** for a new restaurant in Clarkston&quot;.
An experienced restaurateur in opening restaurants, the post's author is looking to skip the conventional method of casting the net for CVs.
&quot;Last time I was hiring for a place I got over 400 CVs&quot; he writes. &quot;You know how long it takes to read 400 CVs? Too damned long. So don't waste anyone's time.
So what kind of candidates is he looking to attract to be his second in command?
&quot;I don't care if you're super outgoing or actually mute. I don't care if you've got tattoos. I don't care if you only work in kitchens to get away from your horrible significant other.
&quot;I don't care about anything other than that you're fast enough not to be in the weeds constantly and you want to be part of something genuine and good.&quot;
 

Unashamedly, he admits that the 25-30hr/week contracts will probably mean 45/hrs a week &quot;right off the bat&quot;.
He writes: &quot;This is a mom-and-pop type restaurant. You can learn a lot. You can have a good degree of freedom.
&quot;What you cannot do is be a pain in my b**ls because my life savings is on the line and I have to work with my wife all day so I don't have time for any primadonna bulls**t.&quot;
By the end of the post, we're starting to get an idea of the man you might be working for: &quot;Send me a real cover letter too, if you're the cover letter type.
&quot;If you have one that says you're a 'hard-working team player that can also function well alone' and that you 'value customer service and punctuality' I will stab myself in the face with a pencil and nobody will get a job.
&quot;Be honest. Tell me what you want to do and why. Your actual strengths and weaknesses. I'm looking for real people with real ideas, not kids using a CV template they found online.&quot;
 

So, after all that, there's a motivational call to arms at the end of the post.. right? &quot;If you think I sound like an obnoxious d***head, congratulations. You are observant and will go far in life.
&quot;Don't let it discourage you, though. I'm only a d***head for the first three years you know me. After that I'm a total sweetheart.&quot;
That'll be a no then.
Nevermind - we still think this could well be the most cutthroat, honest job listing we've ever seen. Read the full listing right here.

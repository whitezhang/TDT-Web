She said: &quot;I'm really pleased that I managed to raise so much money with just five busking sessions.&quot;I wanted to donate to the Moira Anderson Foundation and Calums Cabin because they're really close to me.&quot;I know Duncan and Caroline of Calums Cabin and my mum has volunteered for the Moira Anderson Foundation.&quot;I've only be busking for less than a year. My first busk was in Rothesay and even though I've improved a lot since then I still get nervous when I set up.&quot;As well as gaining popularity online, Beth has caught the attention of Bute Fest organisers who have invited her to perform her own set at the three day music festival on Isle of Bute which runs from 17-19 July.&quot;I've never done anything like this so I'm so excited. I'll be performing eight of my own songs.&quot;I've written quite a few of my own songs. One is about cyber bullying and another is about war which I wrote after watching the news coverage of Remembrance Day.Beth's mother, Morag, 52, helps her daughter with the fundraising by driving her the 40 miles from the Isle of Bute.She said: &quot;The travelling is not an issue. She is raising money and giving back to society so there's no issue with the travelling.&quot;We're very proud of her, it's been amazing watching her voice develop and the fact that her feet are very much on the ground, she's just like any other girl her age in that way.&quot;Nobody expects to hear this powerful voice so they're really blown away when they do.&quot;Caroline Spears from Calum's Cabins spoke fondly of Beth. She said: &quot;Beth has been amazing. She has been really passionate about our charity for 3 or 4 years now.Her singing has raised over &pound;600 for us which has half funded a family coming here and staying for a week with everything included.&quot;Manager at the Moira Anderson Foundation, Gillian Urquhart, said: &quot;We are delighted that beth has chosen our charity to donate money to.&quot;She has worked with before and has been a great support to us over the last couple years, she's an amazing girl.&quot;

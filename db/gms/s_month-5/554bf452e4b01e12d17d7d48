Police in Glasgow have been alerted to a possible fraudulent vote.
Officers said they were investigating one case of &quot;personation&quot;.
It is understood that someone entered a polling station in the Glasgow East constituency and crossed a ballot paper under another person's name.
The presiding officer informed authorities earlier and counting staff were asked to be on the lookout for the paper when the box arrived at the Emirates Arena count.
Glasgow City Council said count staff would wear blue gloves to locate the paper, which will be counted and sealed in a bag before being handed to police.

MORE than &pound;600,000 seized from criminals is being used to fund youth projects across Scotland.
The cash is being given to organisations in the youth work sector to deliver a range of schemes for young people who could be at risk of becoming involved in anti-social behaviour.
YouthLink Scotland, the national agency for youth work, has awarded &pound;625,000 to the projects from the Scottish Government's CashBack for Communities programme, which takes funds recovered from the proceeds of crime and invests them into free activities for young people across the country.
The CashBack Youth Work Fund has been operating for seven years, with 1,738 projects across all 32 councils benefiting from more than &pound;9 million.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: &quot;Investing in our young people is always money well spent and I am delighted that the Scottish Government's Cashback for Communities programme is providing this valuable funding for worthy projects across Scotland.
&quot;This Government is committed to ensuring young people reach their full potential. The vast majority of them are a credit to society, but we want to prevent the small minority getting involved in crime or anti-social behaviour in the first place.
&quot;Scotland's unique CashBack for Communities programme invests monies seized from criminals back into our communities. Since 2008, we've committed &pound;75 million community initiatives right across the country, improving lives and helping Scotland prosper.&quot;
Jim Sweeney, YouthLink Scotland chief executive, said: &quot;Crime is a real blight on our neighbourhoods and it is right that money from the proceeds of crime goes back to the very heart of our communities, our young people. We know that youth work really does change the lives of young people, in every part of Scotland.&quot;

 TWO men killed after a light aircraft crashed near a village in Perthshire have been named as Andrew Thompson, 37, from Cheshire and John MacKinnon, 53, from Ross-shire. 
 Emergency services were alerted yesterday when the aircraft failed to land in its scheduled slot at Dundee airport. 
 

The two-man plane had been predicted to land around noon but all communication with the aircraft was lost around four miles west of the hub, according to a Police Scotland spokesperson.
 Coastguard teams and the RAF were involved in the search and the wrekage of the aircraft was found near the village of Abernyte, Perthshire, at around 4pm. 
Officers continue to liaise with both families and they have requested that their privacy is respected at this difficult time.

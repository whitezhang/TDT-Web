POLICE investigating the death of a man in custody have new leads after officers canvassed motorists yesterday.
Officers from the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (PIRC) stopped several dozen vehicles near the home where Sheku Bayoh, 32, was arrested a week ago.
Mr Bayoh was detained by police in Hayfield Road, Kirkcaldy on the morning of Sunday, May 3 following an incident there.
He died while being arrested by up to 15 police officers.
A female police officer was taken to hospital after being injured in the incident.
There has been no explanation given for his death and there have been conflicting reports of a knife being used at the scene of the incident.
Six officers from PIRC stopped dozens of motorists between 6.30am and 7.30am, yesterday.
A spokesman for PIRC said: ”We have had a number of leads that will be followed up this week, so it has been a successful morning. We would still appeal to the public to come forward with any information.”
Mr Bayoh’s family have hired an independent pathologist to determine his cause of death.
 

Mr Bayoh, who came to Scotland from Sierra Leone, 10 years ago, worked for British Gas and lived with his partner, Collette Bell, and their three-month-old son, Isaac.
He has another son to a previous partner.

MYSTERY continues to surround the final minutes of a man who died following his arrest by police.
Father-of-two, Sheku Bayoh, may have suffered a heart attack during an early morning incident at his Kirkcaldy home on Sunday.
The 32-year-old – known as Shek to pals – worked for British Gas and lived with his partner who was mum to one of his children.
Fife Police have remained tightlipped about what happened and have referred all inquiries to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner.
 

It is understood a female officer needed hospital treatment as she attempted to arrest Mr Bayoh.
Fife Divisional Commander Chief Superintendent Garry McEwan said: &quot;This is a tragic set of circumstances and my condolences go to the man's family.&quot;
&quot;The investigation of deaths in Scotland is the responsibility of Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, who have instructed the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner to lead on this enquiry.&quot;

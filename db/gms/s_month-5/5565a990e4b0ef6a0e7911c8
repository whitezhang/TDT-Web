The prosecution in the Kevin &quot;Gerbil&quot; Carroll murder trial has begun summing up by urging jurors to convict the accused of a &quot;a brazen assassination&quot;.
Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC told the High Court in Glasgow the case against William Paterson was circumstantial.
But he said his guilt had been proved beyond the possibility of doubt.
Mr Paterson, 35, denies shooting 29-year-old gangland figure Mr Carroll in the Asda carpark in Robroyston, Glasgow, on 13 January 2010.
In his summing up, Mr McSporran described the shooting as &quot;a brazen, organised assassination&quot; that put the public at risk. 
He told the jury: &quot;There are no eyewitnesses, no confession to police, it is just a circumstantial case, that's all I've got. 
&quot;But what more could you possibly need?&quot; 
Mr Paterson denies the charges against him and has incriminated six other people.
He has lodged a special defence of alibi claiming he was at an address in Cumbernauld at the time of the shooting.
The trial before judge Lord Armstrong continues.

A LOYALIST march, which was forced to change its route following police fears of serious disorder and violence, will be held in the East End tomorrow.&nbsp;The Regimental Blues wanted to hold a procession starting on Garnock Street, travelling along Royston Road, High Street, Gallowgate and London Road finishing in Tullis Street.Representatives of the organisation said it had been chosen to break down the barriers which are traditionally associated with certain areas of the city and their respective attachment to Republican or Loyalist causes.But police objected to the route saying it posed a high risk of public disorder which could only be contained with a substantial police presence.A report to city councillors last month said: &quot;Police Scotland have made the following comments about the planned procession on May 9.&quot;Should this application be granted, community tensions could rise and the threat of serious disorder and violence is very high.&quot;This would not only impact significantly on the local community but the general public going about their daily business would also be severely affected.&quot;If it considered there are clear risks that if this procession was allowed to proceed as currently proposed, there would be a significant likelihood of public disorder with risks to public safety and extended disruption to the local community.&quot;Councillors were told marches by the Regimental Blues last year and the year before had passed without &quot;significant incident&quot;only because of a substantial police presence.The report continued: &quot;It is to be noted in these previous processions by the Regimental Blues there were no significant issues with the organiser and that the participants behaviour complied with the police code of conduct for processions.&quot;The public petitions committee decided to back a police request that the march to take place from John Knox Street along High Street, Gallowgate and London Road , ending in Tullis Street.

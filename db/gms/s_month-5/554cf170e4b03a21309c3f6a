A man cleared of murdering a 19-year-old student more than 20 years ago could stand trial again under double jeopardy legislation.
The Crown Office has applied to the High Court to set aside the acquittal of Francis Auld and prosecute him again for the murder of Amanda Duffy.
The drama student's body was found on waste ground in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, on 30 May 1992.
It is understood Ms Duffy's relatives have been informed of the development.
In a statement, the Crown Office said: &quot;The Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC has applied to the High Court for authority under the Double Jeopardy (Scotland) Act 2011 to set aside the acquittal of Francis Auld and prosecute him again for the murder of Amanda Duffy.&quot;
It is the third application to be made by Scotland's top prosecutor since the reform of Scotland's centuries-old double jeopardy law in 2011.
The legislation sets out conditions where an accused can be retried for a crime for which they were previously acquitted, with the authority of High Court judges needed for any fresh prosecution.
Double jeopardy cases are handled by the cold case review unit, part of the serious and organised crime division of the Crown Office.

THE Great Kate Wait continues in London with ducks, giant teddy bears and Royal superfans taking centre stage outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington.Media from around the world have been gathering at the exclusive private maternity unit and, when not looking out for signs of a development, have kept busy with even the slightest of quirks.A small flock of ducks landed to join the crowd, attracting a few photographers, and a car had to stop to allow one to cross the road.Earlier, a vehicle with two giant teddy bears on the back caused a stir - one with a blue badge and one with a pink badge - and two mock guardsmen in red tunics stood at the entrance to the Lindo Wing.They were brought by bookmaker William Hill, which was announcing the latest odds on baby names.There is a 500/1 chance that the baby prince or princess will be called Kanye or Taylor, while Brooklyn is at 150/1 and Kim is at 250/1.The long wait has cost those who like a flutter dear, according to Ladbrokes spokeswoman Jessica Bridge.She said: &quot;Punters have lost out on thousands of pounds worth of winnings thanks to the April no-show, but their last roll of the dice suggests we'll see the newborn arrive on Bank Holiday Monday.&quot;&quot;At 8/1 a General Election baby's not out of the realms of possibility, but it's probably a safe bet that Kate and Wills won't opt for a Prince Nigel or Princess Nicola.&quot;Coral's Nicola McGeady said: &quot;Punters are becoming increasingly impatient as the Great Kate Wait continues and, while some have given up predicting the date of birth, others are betting on a Star Wars Day (May 4) royal baby.&quot;The odds of Kate giving birth on the day of the General Election are still quite long at 20/1.&quot;Meanwhile, the royal superfans camping outside the hospital said they were tired after staging their vigil on the pavement.This is the longest John Loughrey, 60, from London, has ever camped out and he thinks it has been 10 or 11 nights - but he has lost count.The royalist said he is looking forward to resuming &quot;normal life&quot;.Fellow camper Sky London, 54, said he is losing track of which day it is but remains hopeful: &quot;Since she didn't turn up yesterday, it has to be today. It's got to be.&quot;With each passing police van or blacked out car, the anticipation goes up another notch.Even a midwife was intrigued by the royal fans and media circus waiting for any news of pregnant Kate.Monica Thompson, a midwife originally from County Leitrim in Ireland but now living in London, stopped at the Lindo Wing to see what was happening.She said &quot;relaxation&quot; is key for the Duchess.She said: &quot;I was nearby. I was in the area doing shopping and I stopped by out of just curiosity.&quot;Ms Thompson said &quot;breathing exercises&quot;, such as those in yoga, would be beneficial to Kate at this time. She also said swimming would be good.Earlier, the Duke of Cambridge has expressed his sympathy for the people of Nepal left bereaved and homeless following the devastating earthquake by signing a book of condolence.With the world waiting for developments with his pregnant wife Kate who is overdue, William visited Nepal's embassy in London this morning to pay his respects.His brief message read: &quot;With my deepest condolences to the people of Nepal and my thoughts and prayers to all those affected.&quot;More than 6,000 people have been killed in the earthquake which struck last weekend leaving 14,000 injured and many more homeless.The Queen and Prince of Wales have already made separate private donations to the DEC (Disasters Emergency Committee) Nepal Earthquake Appeal.William's visit was hosted by the Nepal's charge' d'affaires Tej Bahadur Chhetri and was a sombre moment for the Duke

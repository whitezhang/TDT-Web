 A BEAST who groomed a 12-year-old boy for sex in a public library has escaped prison. 
 Sam Roan targeted the schoolboy with vile online messages while sitting a few feet away. 
A sheriff said he was “very concerned” over Roan’s predatory behaviour but allowed him to walk free from court.
Roan was put on supervision for three years and banned from using the internet or approaching kids.
 The 22-year-old tried to convince the child over Facebook to go outside Leith Library in Edinburgh to engage in a sex act. 
At the time the pervert was out on supervision after sending a photo of private parts to a 13-year-old boy via Snapchat.
He appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Tuesday to be sentenced for both crimes after a psychologist’s report was prepared.
Sheriff Frank Crowe said: “Most of the time you’ve been fine but on at least two occasions you’ve used the internet to communicate with young boys which is a concern to us all.”
The sheriff put Roan under a supervision order and told him to return to court in six months for a progress report.
He was banned from using internet-enabled devices, having unsupervised contact with under 17s and doing volunteer work without a social worker’s permission.
 Roan’s solicitor said his client spent around five weeks in jail following his arrest over the library  incident, which had been a “severe shock” to him. 
Last August Roan was arrested for sending a schoolboy an explicit image and sexual messages on Snapchat from his home in the city’s Wardieburn area.
After being placed on a supervision order in November, he bombarded the youngster in the library with sordid messages on February 18.

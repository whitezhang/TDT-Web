An animal charity has appealed for help after a dog was found dead having been weighed down with two large slabs and thrown in a pond in North Lanarkshire.
The young brown female Staffordshire bull terrier was found in water near Overtown Road, Newmains, on Friday.
The Scottish SPCA said the animal had suffered &quot;significant&quot; head and neck trauma but it was not known if it was alive when it was put in the water.
The charity wants to speak to anyone who recognises the dog's description. 
Scottish SPCA Inspector Heather Lawson said: &quot;The dog had been in the water for 24 to 48 hours before she was discovered.
&quot;Although the trauma to her head and neck was significant it would have been unlikely to be the cause of death, which is unexplained at this stage. 
&quot;It is not yet known if she was still breathing when she entered the water.&quot;
Insp Lawson said the dog had been &quot;weighed down with two large slab-like stones which had been tied to her lead&quot;.
&quot;She was a young brown female Staffordshire bull terrier type and other than her injuries was in good bodily condition,&quot; the inspector said.
&quot;She was a very unusual colour for this breed as this shade of brown is more commonly seen in Patterdale terriers or chocolate Labradors. 
&quot;We would appeal to anyone who recognises the description of this dog and knows who may have done this to her to contact us.&quot;

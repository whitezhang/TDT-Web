A CAMPAIGN against the closure of one of Scotland's leading nightclubs and arts venues has secured over 20,000 signatures in just three days.&nbsp;The Save The Arches petition was heading towards 25,000 names yesterday, in what appears to be another public campaign against Glasgow City Council.It has been signed by prominent figures from the arts, as well as leading DJs and members of the public.The city's licensing board ruled venue was to shut from midnight from Friday following the third attempt by Police Scotland to have it closed in a year.The force cited a litany of drugs finds, with the venue claiming it was being punished for alerting the police to the hauls.The Herald understands that in recent weeks two officers and one city council licensing standards officer visited the venue over concerns it was advertising 'Buckfast Burgers' in its cafe.The venue, which was promoting the gimmick on its Facebook page, was told that if it was to comply with the law it would be required to serve the burgers at their price for 72 hours.A meeting of the Arches board of directors will be held this evening, where it will be decided if a legal challenge will be mounted against the licensing board's decision.Police Scotland had previously failed in an attempt to have The Arches closed last year following the drugs-related death of 17-year-old Regan McColl after it agreed to implementing a number of measures and the board agreed it had taken all the steps it could.Police also complained the club was forcing a drain on its resources.

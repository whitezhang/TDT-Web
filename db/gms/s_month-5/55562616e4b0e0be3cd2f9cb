SCOTS comedian and online sensation Limmy has been offered a bizarre new role by a shopping centre after he came up with an idea about improving their parking spaces.
Award winning Limmy had commented earlier this year on the parking system that is currently being used by Silverburn shopping centre in Glasgow.
He said: “The car park in Silverburn shopping centre has all these wee lights about the spaces, green for empty, red for taken. What an idea.”
After speaking about it online he and his followers suggested to the shopping centre that disabled parking spaces at Silverburn shopping centre should have a blue and a red light above them.
The blue light would indicate a parking space was clear while a red light would show that it was being used.

Following the idea to make an improvement to customer service, the centre’s GM David Pierotti gave his idea the green light and the lights were installed today.
Now the centre are keen to use Limmy’s creative juices and have contacted him privately to see if he will become an ambassador for the centre in the form of People’s Consultant.
An insider said: “Limmy was on Twitter when the shopping centre were discussing improvements they could make to the current parking system and he came up with a great idea which we are now putting into practise. The GM David was very impressed by his thought process and the centre are now keen to get him on board as an ambassador.”
Limmy’s online followers are now celebrating the news with one Fiona Fisher aka @GallusEffie saying: “Aww, that’s just fabulous! I’m so chuffed that you’re helping drivers with blue badges. Well done! I’m ferr chuffed this has happened out of a random conversation. Dead useful too.”
Limmy is remaining humble about his role in getting the lights changed and said: “Thanks for the offer, but it wisnae me, it was @GallusEffie’s idea!”

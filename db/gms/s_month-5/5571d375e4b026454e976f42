 A DISABLED ex- Army corporal has smashed a world record by driving more than 1011 miles from John O’ Groats to Land’s End – on his 8mph mobility scooter. 
 Andy McIntosh, 42, completed the epic ride in just 16 days and eight hours . 
He beat the current record of 24 days and nine hours by eight days and one hour.
 Andy took on the challenge to raise cash for several military charities which have supported him over the years. 
They include Poppy Scotland, SSAFA, ABF The Soldiers’ Charity, Erskine and Soldiers off the Streets.
 Andy left John O’ Groats at 8am on Tuesday, May 5 on his Breeze S4 GT mobility scooter and  eventually arrived in Land’s End on Wednesday, May 20. 
Two Klyde Mobility engineers and a Scottish TGA retailer supported him as far as Gretna Green where his pal Alan Stobo took over the support role.
Andy, from Strathaven, Lanarkshire, was in The Cheshire Regiment for 14 years, serving in Northern Ireland, Bosnia and Iraq but in 2008 he was diagnosed with a rare and inoperable vascular condition which has sleft him with restricted mobility.
Dad-of-two Andy said: “The 16 days were breathtaking. I saw amazing and varied scenery and met some remarkable people.
“I can honestly say I have found this challenge so much easier than I thought it would be.”

A &pound;1m lotto prize has gone unclaimed after the person who bought the ticket in East Ayrshire did not come forward.
National Lottery operator Camelot said the ticket won the raffle prize draw on 22 November last year.
After the 180-day deadline for claiming passed at midnight on Thursday, the &pound;1m prize, plus interest, was given to lottery-funded projects across the UK.
A National Lottery spokesman said the ticketholder had &quot;sadly missed out on this substantial amount of money&quot;. 
The spokesman added: &quot;We tried very hard to find the ticketholder and it's a real shame that they have missed out, but there is still one winner - the nation.&quot;

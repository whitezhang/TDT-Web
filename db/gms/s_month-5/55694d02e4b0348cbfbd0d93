A CARE home boss hit a vulnerable resident on the forehead with a slipper and told another "the quicker you, die the better", a disciplinary panel has found.Lynn Sweeney, who worked as a supervisor at Parkhouse Manor care home in Barrhead, neglected another resident, who was unable to communicate, by throwing his dinner in the bin then stating &quot;if anyone asks, I fed him&quot;, according to watchdogs.She was then found to have written in the man's notes that he had been given a full dinner.She has now been struck off by regulator the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) after they decided her behaviour amounted to &quot;very serious misconduct&quot; that was &quot;fundamentally incompatible with being a social care worker.&quot;Parkhouse Manor Care Home, in Nitshill, provides accommodation for up to 50 adults including those with dementia.Witnesses gave evidence at a recent SSSC hearing into Sweeney's behaviour on between 2010 and 2013.They heard at the former worker had physically restrained one care home resident by holding his hands to his waist and said: &quot;Don't intimidate me, you d**k.&quot;Sweeney was also found to have hit another man on the forehead with a slipper and said, when talking about him: &quot;I hate that old b*****d.&quot;When talking about another she said: &quot;I cant stand that woman, she is a fat lazy excuse for a woman.&quot;The committee found that she also repeatedly failed to take one woman to the toilet when she asked.One witness who gave evidence at the hearing said that Sweeney said called a service user an &quot;evil old b***h and told her &quot;the quicker you die, the better&quot;.This evidence was accepted.In a decision report published following the hearing, the SSSC said: &quot;The misconduct found involved dishonesty.&quot;It also involved placing vulnerable service users at considerable risk of harm.&quot;The behaviour was not an isolated incident, but presented as a pattern of conduct showing disregard to dignity, safety and wellbeing of the service users over a number of years.&quot;The SSSC decided to issue Sweeney with a removal order, striking her from the social services register.The SSSC report adds: &quot;Many of the registrant's [Sweeney's] failings struck at the core of her role as a social care worker.&quot;Given the seriousness and nature of the misconduct found, the public interest in maintaining confidence in the register and the SSSC as the regulator would be undermined were a removal order not made.&quot;Sweeney has 14 days to appeal decision.When contacted by the Evening Times, management at the care home refused to comment on the misconduct.

BOSSES of Glasgow’s Arches nightclub are to appeal a council ruling ordering them to close at midnight.
The city’s licensing board made the order last month, effectively shutting down the venue’s nightclub operation, after a serious of police complaints about drug abuse and disorder.
Regane MacColl, 17, died in February last year after reportedly taking drugs at an Arches club night.
But bosses say the midnight order condemns the whole Arches, which includes arts venues, theatre space, a restaurant and a cafe, to closure.
They met arts funding body Creative Scotland and senior council officials yesterday and announced they will fight the clampdown. They also discussed possible ways of saving The Arches’ cultural programmes.
Creative Scotland and the council have agreed to give them an advance on next year’s funding to help them survive in the short term.
More than 37,000 people have signed a petition against the midnight order, and 400 leading creative figures signed an open letter backing The Arches.

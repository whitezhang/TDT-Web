MORE than 1400 suspects have been investigated by police probing historic child sex abuse allegations against VIPs including politicians, celebrities and institutions.
The figures were revealed by Operation Hydrant, a group set up by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) to explore links between child sex abuse committed by &quot;prominent public persons&quot;.
Norfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the NPCC's lead on child protection, said: &quot;The referrals are increasing on an almost daily basis. The numbers I refer to today are a snapshot in time.&quot;
Out of the 1433 suspects identified, 216 are now dead.
Mr Bailey said that out of these 1,433 suspects, 666 relate to institutions and 357 separate institutions have been identified by the operation.
He said 261 are classified as people of public prominence, of these 135 come from the world of TV, film or radio, 76 are listed as politicians, 43 from the music industry and seven are from sport.
Mr Bailey said: &quot;We are seeing an unprecedented increase in the number of reports that are coming forward.
&quot;That has brought about a step change in the way the service has had to deal with it.&quot;
He said it is projected that police will receive around 116,000 reports of historic child sex abuse by the end of 2015 - an increase of 71 per cent from 2012.
He added: &quot;There is no doubt (Jimmy) Savile has had an effect on us. We are getting dealing with more and more allegations.&quot;

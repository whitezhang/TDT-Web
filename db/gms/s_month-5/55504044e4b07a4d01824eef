NEIL Findlay MSP has resigned from Labour's Scottish shadow cabinet, citing the party's "disaster" in the general election in Scotland.Mr Findlay - who lost to Jim Murphy in the contest to be Scottish Labour leader last year - said the party's problems are &quot;wide ranging and deep&quot; and require &quot;radical solutions&quot;.The Lothian MSP said he wants to play a full part in &quot;rebuilding&quot; the party from the grassroots up, but can only do so &quot;if free from the constraints of being a member of the shadow team&quot;.Submitting his resignation from the shadow cabinet at Holyrood - where he held the fair work, skills and training brief - Mr Findlay said: &quot;Thursday's election was a disaster for the Scottish Labour Party. Despite huge efforts by all concerned since 2007 we have gone from the dominant party of Scottish politics to a party with only 38 MSPs and one solitary MP.&quot;The problems of the Scottish Labour Party are wide ranging and deep. Radical solutions are needed and can only be implemented following a full, frank, open and democratic debate led by our loyal and hard working, committed party members - a centralised fix just won't do.&quot;While Ed Miliband announced he is stepping down as UK leader of the party, Mr Murphy has insisted he will stay in his job in Scotland in a bid to rebuild his ailing party.As the election result became clear, Ian Davidson, who lost his Glasgow South West seat for Labour to Nicola Sturgeon's party, said Mr Murphy could not now continue as leader.It is understood that Mr Findlay has no intention of challenging for the leadership of Scottish Labour, should a vacancy arise.In the statement announcing his resignation from Mr Murphy's Scottish shadow cabinet, Mr Findlay said he wanted to play a full part in &quot;rebuilding our party from the grassroots up&quot;.&quot;I feel I can only do so if free from the constraints of being a member of the shadow team. I have therefore today submitted my resignation from the Shadow Cabinet,&quot; he said.&quot;I want to thank the Labour leadership team for the opportunity to serve the party and movement I love.&quot;I will now redouble my efforts working on behalf of the people of the Lothian region and look forward to continuing with the many campaigns I have been involved in - both outside and inside of the Scottish Parliament.&quot;My commitment and desire to work tirelessly on behalf or ordinary working people has grown even greater on the back of this electoral defeat. This will be my focus in the weeks and months to come.&quot;A Scottish Labour Party spokesman said: &quot;We are grateful for Neil's service as shadow health secretary and shadow fair work secretary. As he himself has said, the Scottish Labour Party's problems are long-standing and wide-ranging.&quot;We look forward to working with Neil in the coming months as we seek to rebuild our party and achieve success in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.&quot;

A SCOTS baby shop has seen demand for a Spanish car seat cover rocket since Princess Charlotte was spotted with one.
Business for Casa Bebe in Paisley, Renfrewshire, is booming after the royal baby was pictured being carried home from hospital in the same one this month.
Until that moment, shop owner Laura Morrow had been struggling to shift the Atelier liners by Pasito a Pasito. But within days she had sold out of the &pound;91 covers and was receiving enquiries from all over the UK.
The shop’s website hits have trebled and Laura has seen her Facebook post about the product viewed almost 55,000 times.
Laura said: “I can’t believe the effect this has had.
“Just because Kate Middleton has one, everybody wants one.
“People were actually phoning and asking about it without even seeing it.
“The batch of 15 I had in, which had been sitting for about nine months, were gone in the space of a week.”
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge welcomed Charlotte Elizabeth Diana on May 2.
 

The fourth in line to the throne, known as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, was born in the Lindo Wing of London’s St Mary’s Hospital weighing 8lbs 3oz.
All eyes were on the new arrival when she was presented to the world on the steps of the hospital.
It emerged the cream woollen bonnet worn by the baby as she made her public debut was a gift from the Spanish mother of the Cambridges’ nanny.
Laura said Charlotte’s car seat cover was from her Barcelona supplier after the company sent her a banner to use on her website, but business took off when Mother and Baby Magazine put details of Laura’s business on their website.
The 39-year-old said: “The covers sold so quickly I’m speaking to the supplier to see how many more I can get in stock.
“I’m getting phone calls and messages every day so word has got around.
“It’s not bad for a little shop in Paisley.”

Bus producer Alexander Dennis Limited (ADL) has secured an order for nearly 120 vehicles from transport giant FirstGroup.
The order, which is understood to be worth about &pound;30m to the Falkirk-based company, includes single and double deck buses and midis.
It is part of an overall order by FirstGroup's UK bus division for 385 new vehicles worth &pound;77.7m.
Northern Ireland-based Wrightbus will manufacture 248 of the buses.
A further 117 will be made by ADL.
In addition, Volvo is building 20 double deck chassis in Sweden, with the bodies manufactured by Wrightbus.
Aberdeen-based FirstGroup said 90% of the vehicles would be fitted with &quot;ultra-clean&quot; Euro 6 engines.
The new buses will be delivered across the UK during the current financial year, with 75 planned for Glasgow, 31 for the east of Scotland and seven for Aberdeen.
ADL chief executive Colin Robertson said: &quot;We are delighted to have won this very significant order and to be continuing our long-established and thriving relationship with FirstGroup. 
&quot;This latest order is a huge endorsement of our new-generation, market-leading midi and double deck buses and a further demonstration of FirstGroup's commitment to the green technologies of tomorrow.&quot;

THE window cleaner who balanced on a ledge without safety equipment was yesterday named as Colin Elliot. 
Colin, 56, from the Partick area of Glasgow, has been cleaning windows for almost 34 years. 
When asked if he ever uses safety equipment, he said: “No, I don’t use safety equipment - it’s not like I do the Empire State Building.”
Colin works in the west end of the city and said the tallest buildings he works on are three storeys high. 
Commenting on those who had questioned his working with no safety equipment, he said: “It’s just from their point of view. I wouldn’t recommend they go out on a window ledge. 
“If you’re fearful of the activity you shouldn’t do it. I have an exceptional head for heights.
“I guess I assess the job quick enough and if I thought it was pushing it safety-wise, I say I want to get those windows hinged before I do it. 
“I would tell them if they were beyond the pail. I know when a window is too dangerous.
“I never go out on a window ledge if I don’t need to. If I have got a bay window I open each of the windows in. My advice is you never take any needless risks. 
“Having survived it for 33 and a half years I must be bloody good at risk assessment.”
One west end resident, who did not wish to be named, said: “He’s a great window cleaner and does a great job, very thorough. 
“He’s a very interesting character and has been working in the west end for a very long time.”

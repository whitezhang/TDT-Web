A VIDEO of a cyclist berating police officers for idling in an Edinburgh bus lane has gone viral.
Thousands of viewers have now watched the five-minute clip that shows a road safety dispute between traffic cops and a cyclist.
A head-cam captures the heated argument that sparks after the exasperated cyclist knocks on the window of a police car for queuing in a bus lane.
 

A miffed cop then approaches the cyclist to take his details for allegedly failing to keep control of his bike and says: &quot;I don't have to explain my actions&quot;.
The row has ignited a huge online debate over which side was in the right - with most plumping for the cyclist.
One comment read: &quot;I agree with the cyclist, but he's made such a massive deal about it. Was looking for a reaction just because he had a camera on him.&quot;
A Police Scotland spokeswoman: “The video footage in question was taken over two years ago and involves officers who, at that time, worked within Lothian &amp; Borders Police.
&quot;The vehicle was legally permitted to be within the bus lane at that time of the day and there was no intrusion into any cycle paths. No complaint was received in relation to this matter, or the officers in question.”

(We understand this footage might be several years old before the current Police Scotland force came into being, but it's only now that it's getting plenty of attention on Scotland's Worst Drivers and Idiot UK Drivers Exposed.)

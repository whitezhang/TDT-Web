A POPULAR nightclub has announced it is to appeal against a ruling ordering it to close at midnight.
Licensing bosses in Glasgow ruled earlier this month that The Arches will have to shut at that time each night.
The move ends the nightclub operation, after a series of police complaints over drug misuse and disorder.
Club bosses said it could lead to the closure of The Arches as a whole, which also includes arts venues, theatre space, a restaurant and a cafe.
At a meeting with stakeholders, Creative Scotland and senior city officials yesterday, the board of directors for The Arches decided that following legal advice, the venue will proceed with an appeal against the licensing board’s decision.
During the meeting, they also explored possible avenues for the continuation of the venue’s cultural programmes and 
activity.
The Arches said Creative Scotland and Glasgow City Council have agreed to provide an advance on their agreed 2015-16 funding to support the venue in delivering its current programme in the short-term, and in gaining specialist advice to enable it to properly consider all future options.

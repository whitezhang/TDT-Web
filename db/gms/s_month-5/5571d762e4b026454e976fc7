A SCOTTISH D-Day hero has made a passionate plea to get a prized medal before he dies.
John Coode, 89, has been told he must wait until next year to receive his prestigious Legion D’Honneur from the French government for his bravery on D-Day.
The former Army Sergeant and his pal, ex-Royal Navy engineer Arthur Stonehouse, 94, are desperate to receive the awards due to their advanced age.
John, who lives in London with wife Nicola, followed his older brother into the Army at the age of 18, and served with 1st Battalion The King’s Own Scottish Borderers.
He said: “I’m keen to receive this medal as soon as possible. None of the Army veterans are getting any younger.”
John still has a German sniper bullet in his leg and shrapnel in his chest, injuries suffered during heavy fighting in World War II.
 

Last summer, the French government revealed they would recognise all surviving D-Day veterans with the country’s highest honour, which was established by Napoleon Bonaparte on this day in 1802.
Royal Navy and Royal Air Force personnel who supported the Normandy landings are to be recognised along with the soldiers who landed on the beaches on June 6, 1944.
Arthur, served as chief engineer of an American ship, which took waves of allied infantrymen to shore during the landings under heavy fire.
 

Paul Salvaire, of the French Embassy in London, said: “The French government has been awarding the L&eacute;gion D’Honneur to D-Day veterans from many countries for several years.
“Since the 70th anniversary of D-Day, in June 2014, British authorities have authorised the French government to award the distinction to British veterans. Since then, 2800 applications have been received in a few months.
“Processing this record number of applications takes some time.”

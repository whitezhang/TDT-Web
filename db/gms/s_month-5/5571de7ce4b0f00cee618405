A SCOTS climber trapped on Mount Everest by the Nepal earthquake has returned home to a hero's welcome.
Brave James Grieve got a well earned hug and kiss from relieved partner Shirley McGhie this afternoon at Edinburgh Airport.
And the super-tough 52-year-old, from Kinross, seemed none the worse for wear after his horror ordeal 21,000ft up the world's highest mountain.
 James was stranded with a party of eight others from the UK and a team of Sherpas who were on a Help for Heroes climb when disaster struck a fortnight ago. 
Avalanches and rockslides caused by the huge quake cut the group off for over 48 hours.

James only had a handful of rations left when he was eventually rescued by helicopter and flown back to Base Camp where a number of his colleagues and fellow climbers had lost their lives.
Before his rescue, James spoke to the Daily Record via satellite phone from his two-man tent, near the top of Everest.
Sounding in remarkably good spirits despite his ordeal he told us: &quot;Conditions have been ok. The earthquake hit on the day we arrived and we were almost swallowed up by an avalanche and we had to dig in our axes and hold on tight because of the after effects and we were very lucky.
&quot;We're used to the mountains, the only thing we weren't used to really is the earthquake. It was unexpected. Our thoughts and sympathies go out to all the families of those killed at Base Camp, it's a tragedy.&quot;

His expedition leader, Daniel Mazur, who works for trekking company Summit Climb, from Bristol, tweeted: &quot;A massive earthquake just hit Everest. Basecamp has been severely damaged. Our team is caught in camp 1. Please pray for everyone.&quot;
And following a huge aftershock, he wrote: &quot;Aftershock at 1pm! Horrible here in camp one. Avalanches on three sides. Camp one a tiny island. We worry about icefall team below..Alive?&quot;

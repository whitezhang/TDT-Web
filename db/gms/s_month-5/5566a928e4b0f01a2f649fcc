THE "heartbroken" mother of a teenager who was gunned down in the street has appealed for information about his murder on what would have been his 18th birthday.Kevin Wilson was shot in the back at the junction of Smithdown Road and Holmes Street in Wavertree, Liverpool, at about 8.30pm on Saturday February 7.The youngster, originally from Viewpark, North Lanarkshire, was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.A post-mortem examination confirmed he died as a result of a single gunshot wound.Six people have been arrested as part of the ongoing investigation but no-one has been charged.Today, Kevin's mother Jane said: &quot;Just over three months ago, I received the news Kevin had been shot and killed in the street outside his home in Liverpool. When those responsible killed Kevin they took away my son.&quot;It has been the hardest three months of my life, the pain never goes away and it just gets worse every day. It is even more devastating today on what would have been Kevin's 18th birthday. I feel completely heartbroken.&quot;I am still hoping that someone will come forward and give the police the information we need, so that those responsible for Kevin's death can be brought to justice.&quot;His father and brother, both named Paul, added: &quot;In February this year Kevin, my son and Paul's brother, was cruelly taken away from us.&quot;We are still waiting for justice to be done. Until you lose a child or a brother in such circumstances you can't understand the pain and suffering brought to our family.&quot;Today we would have been celebrating Kevin's 18th birthday, but this will now only serve to remind us of the emptiness the loss of Kevin has left in our lives.&quot;We would like to see those responsible for taking Kevin away from us face up to what they have done.&quot;As a family, we appeal to anyone with any information that could help us so please contact the police.&quot;Detective Chief Inspector Tom Keaton, of Merseyside Police, said: &quot;Kevin was shot near to the junction of Holmes Street and Smithdown Road, a busy route to and from the city centre, and I would appeal to anyone who was around at the time, either on foot or in a car to cast their mind back, and let us know if they saw anything at all unusual.&quot;That day Everton FC played Liverpool FC in the local derby and a lot of people would have been travelling to and from the city centre. Information that seems trivial to them may turn out to be crucial in our investigation.&quot;Someone knows who is responsible for this callous act which has left a family devastated. It's not too late to search your conscience and come forward now. We firmly believe that the answers lie within the local community.&quot;We understand that people are sometimes reluctant to come forward in the aftermath of such a serious crime as this. Anyone with information can speak to us anonymously and in the strictest confidence if need be. Any new evidence or information will be closely investigated by officers.&quot;Your information could help us make significant progress in this investigation and help us find justice for Kevin's friends and family.&quot;Anyone with information should call the Matrix Serious Organise Crimed team on 0800 230 0600, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.

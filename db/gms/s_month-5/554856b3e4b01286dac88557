PROTESTERS heckled and hurled abuse at a Labour campaign event in Glasgow city centre.Comedian Eddie Izzard was campaigning in Glasgow City centre with Labour Scottish leader Jim Murphy when a group of around 20 demonstrators shouted in people faces and tried to drown them out with loud music from speakers.People were pushed to the ground and children seen being led away crying as the scenes turned ugly.Serial protester, Sean Clerkin, was seen shouting in Mr Murphy's face as the crowd chanted &quot;Red Tories out&quot; and &quot;Scum&quot; at the Labour leader.Mr Clerkin was removed by police from Tollcross Leisure Centre on Friday night after another noisy protest outside where people were abused and insults hurled.Wearing a red Yes campaign badge, Mr Clerkin used a megaphone to scream in the faces of Labour activists as they attempted to protect Mr Murphy at St Enoch Square.Mr Murphy said afterwards: &quot;I am all in favour of listening to the arguments of my political opponents but these people are not prepared to engage in debate.&quot;This sort of aggressive sentiment has come to the fore over the past two years. Surely we don't want to go back to the old divisions of 'Yes' and 'No' from last year.Mr Izzard famous for his cross dressing turned out in Glasgow in a black skirt suit and high heels, wearing a red top and Labour rosette.He said: &quot;It's OK having different opinions, but everyone should be able to put their opinion forward. This aggressive, this violent emotion, why violence? Don't have violence, we should just put our point of view forward and then everyone makes their choice on Thursday.&quot;&quot;This is democracy, it's all about voting. They should let the democratic process happen, it's called democracy, we're putting forward a point of view, we're asking people to vote Labour and they're scared of these words being heard.&quot;Why are they scared of that? Let everyone have their say. It's called democracy.&quot;Last month, it emerged Police Scotland had asked Mr Clerkin to reveal his plans for challenging Jim Murphy in a meeting called specifically to discuss direct action against the Scottish Labour leader.The officers did not ask Clerkin to stop protesting, but said it would help &quot;public safety&quot; if he shared his plans in advance to avoid a police call-out and possible arrest.Police Scotland also last month it would be stepping up protection of Mr Murphy due to protesters repeatedly attempting to gain access to Scottish Labour campaign events.

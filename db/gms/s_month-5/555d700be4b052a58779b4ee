PUPILS from three council areas have come together to design a quiz aimed at contestants of all ages.The youngsters from East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire and North Ayrshire came up with ideas for a national quiz which has teams made up of contestants aged from 11 to over 80-years-old.Teams made up of four older people and four school pupils will battle it out later this year.The 'intergenerational competition' has been set up to challenge negative stereotypes surrounding age and give young and old the opportunity to work together.Councillor Alan Lafferty, convener for social work and health said: &quot;There are many benefits to intergenerational working and it creates great opportunities for young and old to learn and share together. This project is a positive way to provide a structure and sense of purpose to the older people's life, and provides a unique social outlet for older and younger generations to mix.&quot;

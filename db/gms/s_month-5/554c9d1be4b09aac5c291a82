A Glasgow man who bet &pound;30,000 on the Conservatives winning a majority in the general election looks set to pocket &pound;210,000.
The pensioner made the bet at a city branch of Ladbrokes 10 days before the vote, at odds of seven to one.
Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said the &quot;well-groomed gentleman&quot; was poised to be &quot;the biggest winner of the general election&quot;.
He said many punters had backed a hung parliament, and looked set to lose out.
The Conservatives are on course to win a slim overall majority in the election.

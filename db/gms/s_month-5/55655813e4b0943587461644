A GENEROUS wholesaler has made a donation of tinned goods, coffee and juice to a city foodbank.Humza Yousaf MSP joined Rahan Ali-Irshad and Mohammed Ramzan of United Wholesale Grocers at Ibrox Parish Church to hand over goods to Glasgow South West foodbank.The politician contacted local cash and carry owners after he heard the foodbank was running desperately low on supplies.He Humza Yousaf said: &quot;It is an absolute disgrace any person should have to resort to foodbanks to feed themself and their family.&quot;When I was contacted by Glasgow SW Foodbank via Twitter about the shortage of supplies I knew there would be generous businesses like United Wholesalers which would be more than happy to help.&quot;Claire McCunnie who works for Glasgow SW Foodbank said the organisation was grateful for the donation.She added: &quot;We rely solely on donations and have received over 50 tonnes since we opened. It has been wonderful to see the community come together to help those in need, from local businesses, schools, football clubs, churches to the hundreds of individuals who just turn up with bags full.&quot;Glasgow SW Foodbank fed more than 4700 people across the Govan and Pollok areas last year, including nearly 1500 children.Commuters are being urged to bring a tin to town on Thursday as Central Station hosts a food bank collection to help support Glasgow City Mission.A 12-hour donation drive is being held at Scotland's busiest station and passengers and railway staff are being asked to contribute what they can.Organised by station officer Jim Frizzle, the donation drive is the largest of its kind to be held in Scotland and follows the success of a similar event in March 2014 which saw over five van loads, equalling nine months' donations, collected at the station.With a footfall of around 106,000 passengers every day, the station team hope to once again help hundreds of struggling families.Mr Frizzle said: &quot;I was overwhelmed by people's generosity last year and if we can achieve even half as many donations this time around then I'll be ecstatic.&quot;We all usually have something in our cupboard that we don't need or won't use so please look out what you can as it will really make a difference to those individuals who are struggling.&quot;The food bank collection will run from 07am until 7pm and a collection point, manned by staff volunteers, will take donations in the centre of the concourse, close to the clock.Glasgow City Mission needs tinned meat meals, tinned meat or fish, tinned fruit or vegetables, tinned puddings, breakfast cereal and UHT long-life milk, coffee, sugar, diluting juice and toiletries.

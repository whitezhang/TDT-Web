Gavin Whitefield is to retire as chief executive of North Lanarkshire Council.
The 59-year-old, who has held the post since 2000, will step down in October.
In an email to staff at the council, Mr Whitefield said he had been &quot;enormously proud to have had the privilege of serving&quot; in the position.
He said: &quot;The last two years have been particularly demanding and having resolved a number of major issues over that period, the time is now right to pass responsibility to my successor.&quot;
Mr Whitefield entered local government in 1976 with Clydesdale District Council.
He joined Motherwell District Council as assistant director of housing in 1989 and became director of housing when North Lanarkshire Council was formed in 1996.
He was awarded the CBE in 2011 for services to local government in the Queen's birthday honours list.

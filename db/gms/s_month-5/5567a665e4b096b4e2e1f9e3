A MAN who murdered another male by repeatedly stabbing him in a revenge attack has been jailed for life.John Ramsay, 50, stabbed 39-year-old Alan Whitelaw eight times in the neck and arm at the victim's flat in Maryhill, Glasgow, on July 1 2014.He claimed the killing was accidental after Mr Whitelaw attacked him but a jury at the High Court in Glasgow unanimously convicted him of murder in March 2015.Sentence had been deferred for the court to obtain reports.On Thursday, at the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Kinclaven told Ramsay that he would serve at least 18 years in prison before he would become eligible for parole.He added: &quot;I have received Victim Impact statements from members of Mr Whitelaw's family.&quot;It is clear that they have been left devastated by what has happened.&quot;There is nothing this court can do to compensate them for their loss.&quot;You have been convicted of an appalling crime and the sentence is set by law at life.&quot;During proceedings, the court heard how Ramsay and Whitelaw had only met three times before the fatal incident.On the day of the murder, Mr Whitelaw had invited Ramsay to his home in the city's Glenfinnan Road for a drink.After eating a takeaway curry together the two men rowed and Mr Whitelaw attacked Ramsay leaving him battered and bruised.Ramsay was dragged away by a neighbour who heard the fight. As he left, he shouted threats at Mr Whitelaw.Some hours later, armed with two knives, he went back to Mr Whitelaw's home and killed him.Mr Whitelaw's body was discovered by his neighbour Kevin Lundie, 49.In evidence, Ramsay claimed he had returned to Whitelaw's house because he had left his keys there.He told the jury that Mr Whitelaw came at him with two knives and pinned him to the floor and he had to defend himself.However, a jury didn't believe Ramsay's claims and convicted him of murder.Defence QC Donald Findlay told the court that his client accepted the verdict of the jury.

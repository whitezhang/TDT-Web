THE NUMBER of young offenders in Scotland’s prison system has halved over the past eight years.
The decline in youth crime has been so dramatic that one of the halls at the re-vamped Polmont young offenders’ facility near Falkirk is now almost empty.
New figures show there are around 400 men and women under 21 in the prison system.
In 2007 the daily average was around 1,000.
And Scottish Prison Service bosses say this allows them to offer enhanced rehabilitation services to those in the system.
An SPS spokesman said: “We are really pleased to see this dramatic reduction in the number of young people in our care.
”We hope the numbers will reduce still further.
“This means that we have more time to do what we want to do, to provide those young people we do have with an opportunity to change.”
There are 272 male prisoners aged 16 to 21 serving sentences, with a further 112 on remand.
The figure for females in the same age group is just 17.
Polmont’s capacity is 784.
In 2007 a report found it to be “dangerously overcrowded”.

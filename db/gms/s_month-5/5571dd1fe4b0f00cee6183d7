THE father of Mikaeel Kular has sent a happy fifth birthday message to his tragic son in heaven.
Zahid Saeed is trying to cope with new heartbreak after the loss of his close friend Sheku Bayoh, who died during a police incident.
The dad posted a picture of himself and Sheku and wrote: “I love you. Tell my son I said happy birthday today and I hope you be telling him all the good times we spent together.”
 Mikaeel, of Edinburgh, was three when he died in January last year after a three-day beating by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya. She stashed his body in a suitcase behind her sister’s house  in Kirkcaldy. 
Adekoya was jailed for 11 years after pleading guilty to culpable homicide last August last year.
Zahid, 31, was one of around 200 mourners who laid flowers at the scene of Sheku’s death on Wednesday evening.
 

Friends of Sheku, who was originally from Sierra Leone, are holding a fundraising event tonight to pay for legal costs associated with their fight to find out how the 31-year-old died.
Father-of-two Sheku, 31, passed away after being arrested by up to 15 police officers in Kirkcaldy early on Sunday.
A major independent investigation has been launched to determine how he died.
A Facebook page set up in Sheku’s memory has already attracted more than 5700 likes.
 

In the Daily Record this week, the mum of Sheku’s older son Tyler, three, posted a picture of them in happier times with the caption: “You will live on in your boys.”
Connie Barcik appealed for witnesses to get to the truth about her ex-lover’s death.
She added: “I need answers for my son, his brother and his family.
“The people we put our trust into to protect us have changed their stories.”

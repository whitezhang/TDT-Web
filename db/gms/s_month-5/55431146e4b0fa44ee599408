YOUNG football fans that have battled with life-threatening illnesses received VIP treatment and met with Rangers' biggest players as part of a charity Dream Day.Steven McHugh, from Falkirk, and seven-year-old Caitlin Allison were among the group of 20 young people and their guests who gathered at Murray Park at 10am yesterday to take part in the Rangers Charity Foundation's Dream Day.The once-in-a-lifetime experience saw the fans meet with the players and managers before watching the team get put through their paces during training.The avid Rangers supporters, who aged from five to 19, were then whisked away to the famous Ibrox Stadium where they had a special lunch in the Members Club and toured the grounds and trophy room.Caitlin, whose battle with her duplex kidney began at birth, was overjoyed at the opportunity to meet her beloved idols.Despite being admitted to hospital for an operation to remove her part of her right kidney the youngster, from Moodiesburn, was desperate to be in the stands cheering on her favourite team.Her dad, Gareth, said there is no bigger Rangers fan than his season ticket holder daughter.He said: &quot;When we got to the ward she was staying in, she was so excited because she could see Ibrox.&quot;As soon as she could sit up she just stared out the window hoping Broxy Bear might wave up to her.&quot;That is when I decided we had to call the charity and see if there is anything we could do for her.&quot;Luckily for Caitlin, she was invited along to her Dream Day experience with her dream team.Gareth said: &quot;She adores the team and is adored by the fans.&quot;We sit near the front in the stadium, in the family section and she knows every single person on the way down - and she stops to talk to them all.&quot;At Easter, we missed a few games because of her operation but she ended up with about 11 eggs just from the other fans.&quot;Even if the team have a bad day and I say they are rubbish, she is the first to give me into trouble - you cannot say a bad word against them.&quot;She has woken me up in the mornings before school, jumping around, giving me a countdown until we go.&quot;She was beyond excited for it.&quot;Steven, who is recovering from an operation to remove a brain tumour, had played for an under 17s team on the grounds before his diagnosis and was thrilled to return to the homeland of his favourite team.The 19-year-old said: &quot;I was very excited to go and meet the players although I was a little bit nervous.&quot;I took along a Rangers top for everyone to sign and got lots of photographs so my friends will probably be a bit jealous.&quot;The teenager's dad, Neil, said the whole family was glad Steven had the opportunity to have a good day out.He said: &quot;We were just really looking forward to him being able to enjoy himself.&quot;To be honest, six months ago we did not think we would have him here - we are just enjoying every minute.&quot;I think a lot of the time people do not understand what football clubs do outside of the games.&quot;My son is an avid Rangers fan so for him to have this opportunity it fantastic.&quot;It will be a day of smiles for everyone.&quot;And it is unlikely the father-son duo will have been the only members of the group who left with a smile on their face after the four hour long event.The Rangers Charity Foundation administrator, Linda Shields, said: &quot;It has been very successful in the past and it is a nice day for us as well.&quot;The feedback we get from everyone is absolutely amazing.&quot;I think the players enjoy it as well.&quot;When they first come in the kids are always a bit shy and we have to encourage them to go up but they will take every photograph and sign every autograph you want them to.&quot;Even when they start training they are constantly waving over.&quot;They enjoy taking that bit of time out to help those who are struggling and meet their fans.&quot;We get a mixture of people that come along to the events - sometimes they have terminal illnesses, sometimes there is a mix of older and younger people - but when the players come in, the younger kids jump about and everyone's faces light up.&quot;

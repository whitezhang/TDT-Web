ON Saturday night Twin Atlantic will step onstage at the SSE Hydro and confirm their place at rock's top table.But while the show will celebrate the success of last years mega-selling Great Divide album, there's more good news for fans, as singer Sam McTrusty is hoping the local heroes will hit the studio later this year to start work on the follow-up.&quot;As soon as I've got any time off I've been sitting around and messing with the guitar, letting ideas take shape,&quot; explains Sam.&quot;In the past couple of months we've started doing some demos, and it's all mounted up - we've got about 26 ideas already that have come out of nowhere.&quot;I thought I only had about 10 ideas, but it's a lot more - we're planning on recording an album this year and trying to get it finished, then get it out next year.&quot;Great Divide was a much bigger record than anything the Glasgow lads had done before, embracing huge, stadium sized songs and giving their rock a poppier sheen.It's done the trick as the group's popularity has surged off anthems like Heart &amp; Soul and Brothers &amp; Sisters, but Sam's aware that the next album might have to scale things back.&quot;Our music taste as individuals is rooted in more subdued, more humble sounding music, whereas Great Divide is an explosion of happiness and upbeat messages,&quot; he explains.&quot;That was probably off the back of pushing and pushing for years and then having Free (their first album) do so well, so we were in a happy place when writing it.&quot;Now I think we might lean on the more artistic side and show there's more to us than just the sound of Great Divide.&quot;Sam's been able to enjoy the ride so far, more so than when the success of Free took him by surprise.He's found himself touring new countries like Australia, hanging out with celebrities like Rory Mcllroy and Bill Murray at a golf tournament and even doing some modelling.However, Saturday's huge gig, which comes ahead of a NME Stage headline slot at T In The Park this July, will be a different league entirely.&quot;The nerves will be kicking in on the night because I still get nervous if I'm doing anything musical in front of five people,&quot; he laughs.&quot;It's not a nervousness in being too scared to do it myself, it's just I want people to have a good time and enjoy it - I'm like the ringmaster and have to make sure all goes to plan.&quot;Usually just as we go onstage my mind goes blank and I forget everything ...&quot;We talked about whether we should up our production this time, but the whole reason we started the band was to do honest rock as much as we could.&quot;We don't want to overshadow that too much with fireworks or explosions - we like to think that it's our music that brought us to this point and is the main focus.&quot;Yet Saturday will have to go some to top one of the band's most vital early shows, at King Tut's.&quot;King Tut's always stood out, it must have January 2008 or 2009, and that was mind blowing as it's a venue that's been written about in the history books,&quot; recalls the singer.&quot;That was like, oh my god, people know all the words and the songs' - there was crowd surfing.&quot;That's still the best one for us because not only were people supporting us, but it was people in our own city.&quot;Being accepted by your own people is a bit more special.&quot;It makes you more confident that you are doing the right thing and that there must be a bit more integrity to what you're doing, because people in Glasgow can see through fakeness.&quot;Twin Atlantic, Saturday, SSE Hydro, &pound;20, 6.30pm

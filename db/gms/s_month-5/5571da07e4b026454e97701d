 DETECTIVES were yesterday investigating a hit-and-run attack in a Paisley street that left two people injured. 
A gang of four thugs used a light-coloured car to target a man and a woman in Blackstoun Oval, in the Ferguslie Park area of town.
The woman suffered suspected broken ankles and broken ribs as she was run over by the car, while the man was left with injuries to his limbs.
Neighbours claim the frightening incident is part of a vendetta between rival crooks involved in Paisley’s drugs trade.
Police were called to the scene at around 11pm on Monday after receiving reports of a disturbance.
It’s understood three men got out of a hatchback car and hammered on the front door of a house.
While the driver remained at the wheel, a 36-year-old woman and a 26-year-old man were lured from the house before being attacked in the street outside.
The three men then got back into the car, which sped off.
Both victims were treated by paramedics at the scene and were then taken by ambulance to the Royal Alexandra Hospital, in Paisley.
Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening.
One resident in Blackstoun Oval, who asked not to be named, said: “It all started at around 11pm. Next thing, I saw the blue flashing lights and police were everywhere.”
Extensive inquiries were under way at the scene yesterday.
A team of officers was carrying out fingertip searches, while colleagues interviewed local residents.
Police photographers were also there to gather evidence.
Detective Chief Inspector Catriona Henderson, of Paisley CID, said: “We are still at a very early stage in this investigation, with witnesses to interview, statements to gather and evidence to be collected.
“We are also appealing to members of the community to come forward if they have any information that might help us.”
Anyone with information is asked to call Paisley Police Office on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.

FOOTBALL fans are known to enjoy a drink or two before a game but they were given a stern reminder by cops today that it is illegal to do so on supporters' buses.
The Angus division of Police Scotland took part in 'Operation Ostler' ahead of this afternoon's Premiership match at Pittodrie between Aberdeen and Celtic.
Cops stopped and searched supporters' buses travelling north suspected of carrying booze.

The confiscated proceeds were then posted on twitter as warning to other fans considering taking their own carry outs to future games.
It is an offence in Scotland to be in possession of alcohol or be drunk aboard a coach, mini-bus, or train travelling to a designated sporting event.
The driver or person hiring the vehicle on which alcohol is being consumed can also be charged.

A WOMAN sobbed as she described how her partner was brutally attacked by men wielding baseball bats.
Marie Dockery, 47, said Steven Findlay was hit repeatedly with bats or metal poles.
She said that she lay on top of him because she thought he was dead.
Marie said: “The first hit with the baseball bat, Steven went on the ground.
“His head was split wide open. Before he could get up, he was struck again.
“It was the force it hit him with, it was brutal, absolutely brutal.
“I think there might have been two bats because of the speed that they came at.”
She said two of the blows caused two open wounds in Steven’s head and that he was also being punched and kicked on the ground.
She added: “I lay on top of Steven because I thought he was dead. They just kept hitting him with the bats.”
Anthony Murray, 29, of Blantyre, Lanarkshire, and Declan Gallagher, 24, of Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, are on trial at Hamilton Sheriff Court.
Both deny assaulting Steven to the danger of his life, while acting with others.They lodged special defences of self-defence. Murray also denies throwing Marie to the ground and punching and kneeing her.
She suffered a black eye and bruising but blamed them on protecting Steven.
He spent five or six days in hospital after the attack outside the Parkville Hotel, Blantyre, in April 2013.
Marie said she was assaulted by Murray after her son got into an argument. Steven was assaulted as they waited for a taxi.
In her police statement, Marie said she could not describe the attackers. But she identified both in court, saying “I’ve been getting flashbacks ever since.”
The trial continues.

 Rangers manager Stuart McCall says he will have to formally apply for his own job, even if he secures promotion to the Scottish Premiership. 
 And he insists that he has no problem with the Glasgow club speaking to other candidates. 
 McCall agreed a contract until the end of the season  when Kenny McDowall stood down in March. 
 The Ibrox outfit were taken over by a consortium led by shareholder Dave King shortly before that. 
 Rangers, who finished third in the Championship, lead Queen of the South after the first leg of their Premiership play-off. 
 Should they win that, they will need to win further play-offs against Hibernian then the side who finish second bottom of the Premiership to secure promotion. 
 Rangers were linked with a move for the MK Dons boss Karl Robinson but McCall says he does not know who has been approached.

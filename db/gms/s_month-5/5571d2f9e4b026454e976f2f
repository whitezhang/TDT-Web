THE furious family of a nursery pupil yesterday slammed bungling teachers who left him at a safari park.
Owen Paterson, five, was on a school outing to Blair Drummond Safari Park with 300 pupils from Pitcorthie Primary and Nursery, Fife.
But when the coaches returned to the school on Monday, the boy was nowhere to be found.
His mother Amanda, 28, rushed back to the park with teachers to discover Owen had been found by a security guard.
Council chiefs have now launched an investigation into the blunder.
But Owen’s grandmother, Sandra McQueen, 51, from Dunfermline, said her family wanted “answers from the school”.
She said: “There were about 300 kids from the school on the trip and other mums have said it was a bit of a shambles.
“When Amanda went to pick him up from nursery she was told that she had to wait for the rest of the buses to arrive because Owen wasn’t back yet.
 

“Then one of the teachers said ‘we don’t know where Owen is’.
“All the buses were in but they didn’t have any clue where he was.
“Four of the teachers got in a car and Amanda and a teacher got in another and they drove to the park.
“The safari park sent out their security to look for him and he was found about 3.30pm by the security guard.”
 Peter McNaughton, head of Fife council’s education service, said they were treating the  incident “extremely seriously”. 
He added: “We are treating this incident extremely seriously and an investigation has been launched.
“As soon as the child was noted as missing immediate action was taken to contact the safari park and the police.
“We have been in contact with the parents.
“The five year old was found safe and well, still playing in the children’s play area.”

READING books to your baby - or even your bump - helps boost literacy in later life and Scots are leading the way.As Bookbug Week (May 18 to 24) gets underway, a new survey reveals 72 per cent of Scottish parents introduce their child to books within the first 12 months.The YouGov online poll revealed almost a third - 29 per cent - read to their children in the first three months.Marc Lambert, Director of Scottish Book Trust, said: &quot;Sharing a book with your child on a regular basis, from as early an age as possible, is one of the simplest and most effective things you can do to make a real difference to their future.&quot;You might feel silly reading to a tiny newborn, or even to your bump, but your baby will listen closely to the rhythm of your voice and the speech patterns, laying strong foundations for later language development. &quot;The theme for this year's Bookbug Week is Bookbug's Big Bedtime Story. Thousands of young children will take part in more than 400 free, bedtime-themed events across Scotland that will feature appearances from some of the UK's best loved children's authors and illustrators. Families can find details of events happening in their area by visiting www.scottishbooktrust.com/bookbugweek or asking for more information at their local library.

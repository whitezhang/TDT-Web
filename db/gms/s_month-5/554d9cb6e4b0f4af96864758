A 10 year battle to save one of Scotland's oldest churches has been lost.A final appeal to the Church of Scotland, Council of Assembly failed and the decision to close Shettleston Old Church was confirmedWhile the committee praised the congregation for its community work it ultimately agreed the church building was not sustainable going forward.John Mason, Glasgow Shettleston MSP and opponent to the closure, said: &quot;I find it very sad as it is a historical building and I am concerned about a lot of organisations that use the building as a hall because where will they go now if the building is being shut down.&quot;Today the church has also become a centre for the community with variety of groups using the facilities available, as well as established organisations affiliated to the church.The building is also hired by Glasgow Northeast foodbank, one of Trussell Trust's branches who work in partnership with the local church and organisations to bring foodbanks to communities across the UK.Donna Morton, fitness instructor said: &quot;I'm really saddened by the news that the church is closing, as are my members.&quot;We also contribute to the Foodbank here on a weekly basis as well as holding charity events. Hopefully we can source another venue in the area.&quot;Euan Gurr, Scotland network manager for Trussell Trust said: &quot;Even if Shettleston Old is shutting down we would still not let the people of Shettleston go hungry. We would find somewhere within the Shettleston community for another local foodbank.&quot;A Church of Scotland spokesman said: &quot;The building is large and in need of repairs.&quot;The Glasgow Presbytery is committed to helping the congregation unite with the congregation at Victoria Toll Cross Church.&quot;A decision on the future itself will be taken in due course.&quot;The building made up of red sandstone, on 85 Killin Street, celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2002 marking its continued history as one of the oldest Church of Scotland parishes in the city.The original Shettleston church was first built and opened for use in 1752 although at first it was a rectangular structure within a rectangular church yard and it stood near a minor road leading towards Sandyhills.In 1886, partly as a consequence of mining beneath the building which had taken place, it was deemed unsafe by the Glasgow Presbytery and recommended that a new church be built and the old church was then demolished in 1909. The actual building was completed in December 1902 and did not open until 1903.

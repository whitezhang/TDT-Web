THE Heritage Lottery Fund has thrown its weight behind an overhaul of one of Scotland’s leading cultural attractions.

Work on the &pound;66 million revamp of the Burrell Collection in Glasgow is expected to get under way next year after the project received a &pound;15 million pledge from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
Around four times as many items from the collection left to the city by entrepeneur Sir William Burrell will be able to go on display once the revamp is completed in 2019. 
Glasgow City Council agreed last month to meet up to half the cost of the project, with the Scottish Government and Historic Scotland also expected to contribute.
Two new floors will be opened up inside the A-listed building for exhibition spaces, while a new events space outside the building will be created. A complete overhaul of its roof will also be carried out.
Project leaders say some 90 per cent of the 8,000 objects in the collection will be able to go on display.
Colin McLean, head of the HLF in Scotland, said: “The Burrell Collection was one of the greatest gifts ever given to a city and the seed that helped Glasgow grow into the thriving cultural centre it is today.”

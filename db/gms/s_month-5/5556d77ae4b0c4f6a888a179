ANOTHER West End bank has announced its plans to close its doors this summer just three months after the closure of a Crow Road branch.The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) will close its Glasgow Partick branch on Dumbarton Road on August 5 mere months after the expected closure of Bank of Scotland's Broomhill division, which is due to close on May 22.The bank will be writing letters to customers of the branch as well as displaying posters inside the West End building to inform of them of the closure.The spokeswoman said: &quot;We are working hard to ensure there are a number of alternative ways for people in area to continue banking with us.&quot;We are committed to following the UK Government protocol on branch closures, and we have made the decision following careful consideration of a wide range of factors including branch usage and the alternative ways our customers can bank locally with us.&quot;Branch users will be able to use the local post office to check their balance and deposit or withdraw funds due to an agreement made by RBS and the bank also plan to keep their ATM in the local area.Customers will now have to make the move to the bank's nearby Byres Road branch, which is located less than a mile away and is due to receive a &pound;600,000 investment later this year.The branch has seen a 13% decline in the number of transactions taking place since 2011 and only 75 customers use the bank on a regular weekly basis, 46 of which already use other branches in the area.An RBS spokeswoman said the bank's customers are 'increasingly' using different methods to bank including online and mobile banking.The company has reported that online and mobile transactions have grown more than 300%, while branch transactions have declined by around 35% over the last five years.The RBS spokeswoman said: &quot;Between now and the closure date, we will engage with all of our customers, local businesses and the wider local community to make sure they are aware of the alternative ways of accessing their banking with us in the local area and to answer any questions they might have.&quot;As The Evening Times reported in March, local people were outraged over the decision to close down the nearby Bank of Scotland branch when the plans were announced.SNP councillor Kenny McLean, who represents Partick West, previously said he would write to the Bank of Scotland to inform them of his objections to close the Broomhill branch.He added: &quot;There seems to be an increasing trend of banks not being prepared to provide local services for local people.&quot;However, the bank said the decision to close the Broomhill branch came because there is another branch nearby which serves the local area.

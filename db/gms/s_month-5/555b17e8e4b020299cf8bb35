GLASWEGIAN Zubia Aslam was 24 when Chua poisoned her.
Nearly four years on, she is still trying to make sense of what he did to her.
Zubia, a bank clerk, was admitted to Stepping Hill with gastroenteritis in July 2011 and put on a saline drip. Chua had laced the solution with insulin.
She quickly showed signs of poisoning. Staff took her off the drip and saved her life.
Zubia, now 27, said yesterday: “The verdict provides some closure to me and the other families involved.
“At least someone has been brought to justice. It gives a little peace of mind. But it still feels as though there is a scar left – a scar which will fade with time but never go away.
 

“This has turned my life upside down but also that of my family.
“I still have questions about how this was allowed to happen in the first place. What measures have been taken to date, and will be taken going forward, to ensure this never happens again?”
Zubia is suing the NHS Trust who run the hospital.

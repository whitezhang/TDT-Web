Patrick Harvie, the co-convener of the Scottish Greens, has announced he will stand in a first-past-the-post seat at next year's Holyrood election.
Mr Harvie will contest the Glasgow Kelvin constituency in next May's poll.
He has been a Green MSP for the Glasgow region since 2003, elected under the proportional &quot;list&quot; system.
Mr Harvie will remain top of his party's list for the election, but said the &quot;time is right&quot; for him to contest the constituency seat.
The voting system for Holyrood means MSPs for the Scottish Parliament can be elected in one of two ways: under a constituency first-past the post system like that at Westminster, or in a second vote where parties are allocated additional members on a proportional basis.
Mr Harvie was elected under the latter method.
He said he was &quot;delighted&quot; to be standing for the Kelvin constituency, which is currently help by the SNP's Sandra White.
He added: &quot;It's been an honour to represent the city in the Scottish Parliament for the past 12 years and I believe the time is right to contest the constituency vote.
&quot;We have a strong team in Glasgow, with four Green councillors who have made a huge impact in their communities. 
&quot;With that track record, we are campaigning to win Kelvin in 2016.&quot;
The Greens said polling put them on about 10% on the regional vote for next year's election, suggesting they could get eight to 12 MSPs, with at least one in each of the eight regions.

Homeless war veteran Desmond McLaughlin has been told he's now in a "priority group" for housing.Glasgow City Council has also offered temporary accommodation to the 61-year-old from Easterhouse who works as a chef in a retirement home.However, the hero marine has insisted he's going to live in his car until he's offered a permanent home which he can afford.The Evening Times revealed on Tuesday that the veteran who fought for his country in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan had been sleeping in his car at a retail park in Glasgow's south side after splitting from his wife.He survives on his wages which total less than &pound;1000 a month and a small armed forces pension of &pound;300 a month.Mr McLaughlin said: &quot;The council wanted to charge me for a temporary bedsit in a bad area and I was worried I'd be stuck there.&quot;They were in touch with me again yesterday and said they would review my case.&quot;Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) told the Evening Times Mr McLaughlin's council homeless referral came through yesterday.&quot;He will now be placed in a priority group for housing,&quot; said a spokeswoman for GHA. &quot;We would urge Mr McLaughlin to make an appointment with our local housing staff who will be happy to give him more detailed advice on how he can maximise his chances of securing a home.&quot;Mr McLaughlin, who is more than six feet tall, has been living in his Honda Jazz since May 7, when he first approached the council for help.A spokesman for the local authority said: &quot;Mr McLaughlin was originally offered temporary accommodation while we assessed his homelessness application but that accommodation was declined.&quot;His homelessness application has now been assessed and we have referred his case to relevant housing associations in Glasgow so he can begin the process of securing permanent housing.&quot;Mr McLaughlin has again declined the offer of temporary accommodation in the meantime but the offer remains open to him should he change his mind.&quot;Mr McLaughin added: &quot;I want a council house in a good area. I'm holding out for something better.&quot;

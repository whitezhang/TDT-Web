A YOUNG Scot has worked some magic to become an internet hit after posting videos of some rather impressive tricks online.
Cameron Young uploaded one of his first videos last week - and its hits have multiplied quicker than you can say puff paff poof currently sitting at well over 200,000.
The 18-year-old is a member of Edinburgh Magic Circle and even met his hero, TV magician Dynamo, earlier this year.
But Cameron says his real inspiration has always been his dad who used to be a magician.
“[He] used to be a magician and I saw photos and video clips of him performing for people and I have always wanted to do the same,” said Cameron.
“Everyone has their first start-up kit so I started practising and I realised I was doing quite good at family parties and at school.
“I gave up for a few years and then I watched Penn and Teller when I was about 14 and I became addicted to it.. and have been ever since.”

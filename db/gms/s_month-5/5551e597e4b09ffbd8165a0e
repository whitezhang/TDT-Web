T in the Park will go-ahead at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire after councillors gave it the green light.The planning application for the three-day music spectacular was approved on Tuesday - just two months before the event goes ahead.The decision comes after months of controversy, with wildlife groups raising concerns about ospreys and the environment.Two public consultations on the application were held before the unanimous decision was made by councillors at the committee meeting.The festival takes place from July 10-12 at the Strathallan estate next to Aucherarder.T in the Park, which attracts 85,000 music fans each day, was forced to move from its home at Balado, near Kinross, after an underground pipeline sparked safety fears.Bosses chose Strathallan Castle for the new site after a two year search.Geoff Ellis, CEO of organisers DF Concerts and Events vowed to deliver a festival that would make the community proud.He said: “We’re happy that the committee has approved our application and our team can get on with the plans for a fantastic first year of T in the Park at Strathallan Castle.“We’d like to thank the business and tourism sector who recognise the value of the event as one of Scotland’s national treasures and offered tremendous support throughout the process.&quot;Most importantly, massive thanks go to the local communities surrounding Strathallan who spent a huge amount of their own precious time to show the country that they warmly welcome T in the Park.&quot;We will deliver a festival to make them proud and look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship, just like the one we had in Kinross and Milnathort for the last 18 years.”“We do also understand that not everyone wanted the event at Strathallan but we would hope that these people now accept the decision following what has undoubtedly been the most rigorous and intensive process for staging an event in Scotland's history.&quot;It is our intention to work closely with all residents to ensure that we are excellent neighbours and minimise any disruption to local life.&quot;We also hope they will appreciate that it is our intention to continue to work with the relevant authorities and organisations to ensure the long-term protection and safe-guarding of the local environment surrounding Strathallan.”“We’re now excited about welcoming an outstanding line-up and the best audience in the world to the most beautiful festival site in the country this July.”T in the Park was first launched with founding partners Tennent’s Lager at Strathclyde Park in Glasgow in 1994 before relocating to Balado, near Kinross three years later.Over the next 18 years the festival went on to win multiple awards – including being the only major UK music festival to be awarded the Greener Festival award for the last seven years. Last year, a survey by EKOS showed that the event generates &pound;2.7 million for the local economy and &pound;15.4 for Scotland as a whole.Strathallan Castle will now play host to one of this year’s best line-ups, including Kasabian, The Libertines, Avicci, Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Twin Atlantic, David Guetta, The Prodigy, Jessie J, Paloma Faith, St Vincent, Jessie Ware, Fatboy Slim and Rudimental to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;T in the Park 2015 tickets are on sale at www.tinthepark.com or www.ticketmaster.co.uk or 08444 999 990.&nbsp;&nbsp;

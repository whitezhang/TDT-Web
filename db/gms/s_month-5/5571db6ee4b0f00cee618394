POLICE have charged 80 people with 300 break-in offences in Edinburgh during the last six weeks.
Officers relaunched Operation RAC at the start of April to target housebreakers, and more than 200 raids on homes and businesses have been solved.
In the latest crack down, a 28-year-old man was charged after properties in the Dalry area were broken into between April 27 and May 1.
A 16-year-old boy was also charged with six break-ins and thefts from across the city.
And a 44-year-old man was charged following a burglary in the Parkhead area on April 16 when the occupant disturbed an intruder.
As well as the 80 arrests for 300 break-ins and attempted break-ins, 50 people have been charged with motor vehicle thefts linked to housebreaking.
Cops said the number of break-ins has fallen from just over 70 a week to 50 since the start of the blitz while solved cases rose from five per cent to 30.
Superintendent Matt Richards said: “Operation RAC will continue to identify those responsible for housebreaking and acquisitive crime.”

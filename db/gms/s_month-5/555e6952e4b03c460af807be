More than 50 professors and consultants at Scotland's largest cancer hospital have warned patients could be put at risk by a change of services.
A major shake-up of care in the city is taking place as part of a move to the new South Glasgow University Hospital.
Doctors at the Beatson cancer centre claim the changes will leave inadequate staffing in the event of emergencies.
They have written to Health Secretary Shona Robison to say the situation is &quot;desperate&quot; and called for action.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it would &quot;never put the safety of patients at risk&quot;. 
The health secretary said the views of clinicians, including those at the Beatson, &quot;need to be fully addressed&quot;. 
The letter from senior medical staff, which has also been sent to the General Medical Council, said they &quot;cannot continue to admit patients&quot; unless changes due to take place next week are stopped.
The new super hospital on the south side of Glasgow, which cost &pound;842m to build, replaces four ageing hospitals across the city.
The consultants have claimed that, three miles away in the Beatson, only junior doctors will be left on site out of hours.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it recognised the consultants' concerns.
The health board said temporary arrangements were in place and long-term plans were still being finalised. 
It said: &quot;Plans are also in place to include critical care training for oncology nursing staff.
&quot;In the interim period we will also provide resident overnight anaesthetic cover to the unit and will identify a named anaesthetic contact for daytime patient management issues.&quot;
Responding to the letter, Health Secretary Ms Robison said: &quot;It is vital that the health board addresses the issues raised so that the move can go ahead with the support of the clinicians.
&quot;I have spoken to the chairman of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and had assurance this will happen.&quot;

A GROUP of budding chefs who have left behind a life of gang violence, drugs and prison will tonight prepare a three-course-meal for 200 guests in a plush Glasgow venue.The six young men - many of whom could not boil an egg a few months ago - are taking part in Action for Children Scotland's second Yes Chef event.They have spent 12 weeks being put their paces by top chefs across the city at eateries including Mother India, the SSE Hydro and Tennent's Training Academy.They will split into two teams to take over the kitchen of the Grand Central Hotel to treat guests to dishes including carved lamb, lemongrass chicken and chocolate tart in the fundraising event.Dad-of-one Craig Barrowman said the training had changed his life.The 21-year-old from Greenock was involved in gangs and says his life was out of control.He said: &quot;I was in a lot of gang violence. My brather was in jail for a lot of years.&quot;I knew I was going the same way and I didn't want to go down that path.&quot;It came to the point I knew I had to pick jail or my family.&quot;I thought I was the hardman but I realised I wasn't a man - I was just being a daft wee boy.&quot;Craig said he ate microwave meals before starting this challenge.He said: &quot;I didn't eat properly before, now I actually cook things.&quot;I like making my wee chocolate fondue - that's my favourite.He hopes he can work his way up to become a full-time chef.Blair Crawley, from Kilmarnock, also said the training helped him to turn his life around.The 21-year-old said: &quot;I was going out and drinking all the time, I was laying about and doing nothing.&quot;Now I've got motivation to do something with my day.&quot;The men are supported by the charity's Moving On services to reduce rates of reoffending.Around 85% of young men involved do not return to prison within two years, compared with a national average of 50-55%.Paul Carberry, at Action for Children Scotland, added: &quot;These young men made mistakes early in their lives and spent time in prison as a result. At Action for Children Scotland we believe it is important that they are given the opportunity to choose a new way of life and support to succeed.&quot;

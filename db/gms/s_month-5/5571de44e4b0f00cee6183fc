 HOLIDAY coma survivor Cally Simpson finally returned home yesterday after spending almost a year in hospital. 
 The four-year-old was left fighting for her life after being found face down in a swimming pool in Salou, Spain, last June. 
Mum Kate kept a vigil at Cally's bedside as medics abroad and at home in Scotland battled to save her after the accident, which happened while she was on holiday with her dad, Steven.
But wheelchair-bound Cally, who now communicates using her eyes and sounds, has finally been allowed to leave Ninewells Hospital and return to her specially-adapted house in Arbroath, where her family held a special bash to celebrate.
 

Kate told The Sun: &quot;Our new life starts now. We'll do all the normal things we haven't been able to do over the past 12 or so months.
&quot;I'm so emotional, I've been crying all day.
&quot;There were a lot of times I thought there was no chance this was ever going to happen. But Cally has surprised everyone. She is a strong little girl.&quot;

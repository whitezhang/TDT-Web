STEWART PATERSON@patersonHTDOUBLE parkers and pavement blockers could fall foul of the law under plans by a Glasgow MSP.Sandra White SNP MSP for Kelvin has introduced a Member's Bill to crack down on irresponsible parking.Ms White has had numerous complains about drivers blocking pavements, parking under windows and clogging streets.She said it was preventing people with disabilities and visual impairment getting about safely and had implications for emergency services.The Evening Times has reported the MSPs concerns in parts of the west end and Yorkhill in her constituency.The Bill, if it becomes law would make it illegal to park on pavements and on dropped kerbs.It would also ban double parking, which affects many streets where there is inadequate parking for the volume of cars.She faces a battle to have her bill implemented as the Scottish Parliament lawyers have said it is not an area where it can make laws.Ms White said: &quot;For the thousands of people affected by irresponsible parking, who cannot get about and lead their daily lives, this Bill will provide legislation which will be enormously important and will make a huge positive difference to them.&quot;Ms White said her aim was to ensure free movement for pedestrians, especially those with mobility issues or visual impairment.Her Footway and Double Parking (Scotland) Bill has the backing of groups representing disabled people.Jane Horsburgh, spokeswoman for Guide Dogs Scotland, said: &quot;For the all vulnerable pedestrians who find blocked pavements challenging or dangerous to navigate this legislation has been a long time coming.&quot;The current lack of enforcement means everyday trips to shops and local services can be a nightmare.&quot;As well as enforcement we hope the new law will be backed by a publicity campaign spelling out the consequences of inconsiderate parking.&quot;Stuart Hay, director of Living Streets Scotland, said: &quot;Pavement parking is number one complaint here at Living Streets.&quot;Pavements are for pedestrians, not vehicles, and parking on them causes inconvenience and danger.&quot;The time for action is now as existing powers don't work and are seldom used by the police or local authorities.&quot;Sandra White's Bill is a major step forward and must be swiftly adopted if Scotland is serious about boosting walking in our towns and cities.&quot;Ms White recognised it may not be able to be passed. She added: &quot;I am disappointed that Scottish Parliament lawyers have ruled that the Bill is outwith its legislative competence and I will continue to look for a way to take the legislation forward.

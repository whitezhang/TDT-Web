THE car thought to have been used in the killing of Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll was later seen on CCTV near where the murder weapon was found, a jury has heard.
Detective constable Neil Grieve was giving evidence yesterday at the trial of William Paterson, 35, who is accused of murdering Carroll at Asda, Robroyston on January 13, 2010.
Clips of CCTV from the day of the shooting were played to the High Court of Glasgow, showing the car park in Asda and streets in Coatbridge.
Grieve said that after looking at all the footage, the car he pointed out as a Volkswagen Golf is assessed by him “as the same vehicle” in all pieces of footage – including on a street near where the guns used to kill Carroll, 29, were found.
Paterson denies murdering Carroll and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The trial continues.

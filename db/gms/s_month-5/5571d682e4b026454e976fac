CHILDREN and teachers have been left in a state of shock after vandals broke in and flooded their primary school.
Tens of thousands of pounds of damage was caused at St Bernadette’s school in Motherwell at the weekend.
Headteacher Christine Boyle said pupils’ work and thousands of pounds of materials had been destroyed after vandals climbed on to the roof, broke into the boiler room and smashed water pipes.
She told our sister paper the Wishaw Press: “The destruction is on an industrial scale.
“It’s going to be very hard to replace some of the things we’ve lost.
“We’d recently taken part in a pilot literacy programme and around &pound;8000 worth of reading material alone has been destroyed.
“It’s absolutely heartbreaking for all the pupils and staff.”
The vandalism was just one of several similar incidents at schools in the area over the weekend.
 

Two boys aged nine have been accused of ransacking St Ignatius Primary in Wishaw.
And police are trying to trace a gang of youths wearing coloured tracksuits after fires were started at Thornlie Primary and Netherton Primary in the town within 30 minutes of each other on Sunday.
Councillor Jim Logue said: “The damage is among the worst we’ve ever known in a single weekend.”

A GOVAN pensioner has recorded his first album and music video at the ripe old age of 80 with the help of a local community radio station.Curran McClean was helped to achieve his lifelong ambition of recording an album when he went along to Sunny Govan Radio following major health problems.The 80 year-old father of eight, who went along to the radio station after suffering two strokes, which ultimately hampered him in fulfilling his dream, said making the album was an unexpected surprise.Mr McClean said: &quot;It was something unbelievable, out of the blue, I wasn't expecting it. The day Steg said to me 'you're going to make an album', I was very surprised and delighted.&quot;When I got home, I told my family I was going to make an album and they were beside themselves with happiness.&quot;Mr McClean chose twelve songs - all of which were penned by the pensioner - for the album which was influenced by swing legends Tony Bennet and Guy Mitchell.According to the 80 year-old, the biggest influence on his music has been Sunny Govan radio, which has given him the motivation to continue writing.He said: &quot;I want to keep writing for as long as I can and try to keep singing. If I can sing the songs, I can write them.&quot;And to get back my abilities again of playing musical instruments again, which I will get that back gradually.&quot;They were affected by the stroke I had but I'll eventually get them back. I can play the guitar and I'm learning the Keyboard, which is very difficult.&quot;But I'm pretty sure I'll get back to where I was again.&quot;After Mr McClean's second stroke two years ago, the pensioner decided to volunteer at the radio station in Govan and recently made a video to accompany his music.Steg G, radio presenter at the station, said: &quot;When he first arrived at Sunny Govan he was really down and was feeling his age. I'm a musician myself so I was quite upset to see him the way he was.&quot;When he let me hear his songs I was blown away by the quality of the lyrics and his singing. At that point I decided I would help him out to fulfil his dreams.&quot;His video kind of shows his journey from his first visit to Sunny G when he was low, to now, when he feels top of the world.&quot;

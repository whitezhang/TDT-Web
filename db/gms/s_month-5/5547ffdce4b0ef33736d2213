 Glasgow Rocks' Sterling Davis has announced his retirement from playing so that he can focus on coaching the team he has represented for nine years. 
 Davis has been player-coach of the franchise for the past eight seasons and is relishing the prospect of his new role for the 2015/16 BBL season. 
 He told BBC Scotland: &quot;It's always a tough decision after playing so long. 
 &quot;I am looking forward to being able to focus on tactics instead of focusing on the physical and tactical aspects.&quot; 
 The American-born player joined the Rocks during the 2006/07 season and made more than 300 appearances, scoring an average of 10.66 points per game. 
 &quot;I thought this was a good time to go ahead and make that transition,&quot; he continued. 
 &quot;I just want to continue to make sure we are competitive every year. 
 &quot;We try to focus on being professional in everything that we do and we take pride in how we do it. 
 &quot;We have grown as an organisation and we have improved our fan base. Now our priority is to get some silverware coming back to Glasgow.&quot;

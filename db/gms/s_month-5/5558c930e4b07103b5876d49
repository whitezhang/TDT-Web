THE biggest women-only 10k in Britain took place in Glasgow today with thousands taking part.
Conditions weren't at their best but it didn't stop the runners enjoying themselves with Gemma Rankin the first over the line on 35 minutes and 31 seconds.
She was quickly followed by Gillian Palmer a minute later and Jill Knowles a further two minutes back.
In all, thousands took part in the event to raise money for charity and here are some of the best pictures from the day.

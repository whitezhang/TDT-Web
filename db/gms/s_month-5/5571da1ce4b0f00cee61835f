CLUBBERS and DJ’s alike reacted with shock and anger at Glasgow City Council’s decision to shut down the Arches nightclub.
The controversial nightclub will be permanently shut down following complaints by Police Scotland that there were “potentially lethal and profound consequences” unless problems were addressed.
A meeting of Glasgow’s licensing board yesterday ruled to close the nightclub element of the venue, which also boasts a major arts centre.
Its licence can now only operate up until 12pm rather than 3am, police said.
The nightclub came under fire in March after 26 people were reported for drugs and alcohol-related offences in one night while a woman also collapsed outside the venue after a dance event was marred by trouble.
On Facebook, legendary Monkey Mafia DJ Jon Carter said: “Terrible news - had amazing nights playing there. Always special.”
Events organiser and former Pacha London manager, Alex Anderson, posted: “I did my live essential mix from the arches in 2000, one of the best venues I had the privilege to play, absolute scandal that it’s being forced to close.”
On Twitter, dance music duo The Rhetoriks tweeted: “Can’t believe The Arches has been closed down! This is awful for the Glasgow music scene. #SadTimes. scunnered.”
Gary Feeney posted: “Completely and utterly f***** stupid, ignorant and downright moronic decision to shut down the Arches.”
Connor Whitelaw tweeted: “Absoulete joke the arches is shut down.”
Keir Williamson said: “Devastating news about the arches closing down, best club in Scotland! Same problem will just go onto the next venue!”
And David Archibald tweeted: “This decision may well result in the closure of one of Europe’s most highly regarded arts venues”

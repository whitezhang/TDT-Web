A high school physics teacher told a pupil that they were “on his s**t list”, it has been claimed.
Andrew Kerr is also reported to have told the S5 Ardnamurchan High School student to “shut the f*** up”.
He was later dismissed by the Highland Council and faces a fitness to teach hearing before the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS).
A report submitted by the GTCS said: “Between August 15, 2012, and April 16, 2013, whilst employed as a teacher at Ardnamurchan High School, you did use inappropriate language towards an S5 pupil.
“In particular you did say: ‘If you were on my s**t list before, where do you think you are now?’, ‘Shut the f*** up’, and ‘You should f****** know that’.”
Kerr is also alleged to have used current National Assessment Banks (NABs) as practise NABs in violation of school policy and shown a pupil a copy of the marking guidance for a physics NAB.

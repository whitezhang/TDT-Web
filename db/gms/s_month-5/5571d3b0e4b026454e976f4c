TRAVELLING on a tram gave learner guide dogs plenty of paws for thought yesterday.
Handler Susan Rodgers and puppy Cinder, above, were among those getting on board at Edinburgh airport for training.
The animals had their first trip on the tram network to help them get used to public transport.
Tram director Tom Norris said: &quot;We want to make travelling on our trams as easy as possible for everyone.
&quot;Our vehicles have been designed with high visibility handrails, and our passenger alert buttons signposted in Braille for blind and partially sighted tram users.
 

&quot;However, we are always seeking to help improve the experience for our passengers and I look forward to supporting Guide Dogs Scotland with their training.&quot;
Cllr Lesley Hinds said: &quot;Our engagement with Guide Dogs Scotland is key to our continued commitment to create an integrated and accessible transport system for everyone who wants to get around Edinburgh.
&quot;Both Edinburgh Trams and Lothian Buses are determined to be at the forefront of accessibility to make a real difference to the lives of blind and partially sighted people.&quot;

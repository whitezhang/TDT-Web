MSPs of all five Holyrood parties have issued a strong criticism of the UK government plans for more powers for the Scottish Parliament.The Devolution Committee which includes members of the Smith Commission said the proposals &quot;sells Smith short&quot; and does not reflect what was agreed last year.Concerns were raised over welfare, taxation and the Scottish Parliament being permanent.The MSPs said there were concerns that the plans were confusing, lacked clarity and could actually hinder implementation of the recommendations.Bruce Crawford, Committee convenor said: &quot;The Committee believes that the current proposals do not yet meet the challenge of fully translating the political agreement reached in the Smith Commission into legislation.&quot;He said the plans proposed by the UK Government &quot;sells Smith short&quot;.Linda Fabiani SNP member who was also on the Commission said she &quot;liked to think it was not deliberate&quot;He said in its present form the committee would not be able to recommend the clauses to the Scottish Parliament, but added we were not at that stage yet.On welfare the committee said it has concerns &quot;with a number of the welfare provisions and considers that the relevant clauses do not yet meet the spirit and substance of the Smith Commission's recommendations and potentially pose challenged in any attempt to implement them.&quot;Mr Crawford urged the Prime Minister to rethink the proposals and deliver what the Smith Commission agreed.He said: &quot;We call on the new UK Government to consider our report as a matter of urgency and to work with the Scottish government to help ensure that we have legislation that achieves the objectives that all five parties on the Commission signed up for.&quot;The Conservative member of the committee, Alex Johnstone, said the report was an &quot;opportunity to improve the draft clauses&quot; proposed by the Westminster government.The Scottish Government agreed with the committee, while the UK Government said it was committed to delivering what was agreed.Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, said:&quot;I share the Committee's concern that in a number of key areas, particularly in relation to welfare, the draft clauses do not meet the spirit or substance of Smith.&quot;I expect the UK Government to take the unanimous views of the Devolution Committee very seriously and amend the Scotland Bill before it is introduced.&quot;A Scotland Office spokesman said: &quot;The UK Government is committed to delivering more devolved powers through the package outlined by the cross-party Smith Commission. We will work to bring forward a Scotland Bill on this basis and ensure the Scottish Parliament becomes one of the most powerful devolved parliaments in the world.&quot;

THE family and friends of the late Paul McBride QC, who was one of Scotland's leading advocates, have donated Â£80,000 to Yorkhill Children's Charity in his memory.Donations given through the Paul McBride QC Tribute Fund have enabled Yorkhill Children's Charity to enhance play and family support services on the ward as part of a &pound;5 million commitment to the new children's hospital.A special tribute ball was organised in November 2012 by Paul's close family and friends, including Tony Graham, Louise Arrol and his partner, Gary Murphy.Mr McBride, who was the lawyer for our sister paper, The Herald, died suddenly in 2012 at the age of 47.The hospital moves from its current location at Yorkhill to a brand new, world-class facility at the New South Glasgow University Hospital campus on June 15.His mother, Mary, said: &quot;The new children's hospital offers the chance of hope and recovery to so many sick children and their families from throughout Scotland and beyond, and we are delighted that we have been able to make a positive, and lasting contribution to this incredible Scottish establishment.&quot;Paul cared deeply for people, and we know that this will be a true and fitting legacy to all that our son stood for.&quot;The donation will fund pull down beds in each room on the ward, providing parents, families and carers with a comfortable place to sleep next to their child during a hospital stay.There will also be an enhanced play room, giving children the opportunity to leave their beds and play together during a hospital stay.The new hospital has more single bed rooms to give patients privacy, and the play room provides a space where children who spend long periods in hospital can interact and socialise with one another.The enhancements include a portable multi-sensory unit.This special unit can help in both assessments and treatments to relax and distract children who might need additional support, for example for young children with autism.Shona Cardle, Chief Executive of Yorkhill Children's Charity, said: &quot;The role that the family plays in the care of a child in hospital cannot be underestimated.&quot;Providing a bed for a parent or carer allows them to be by their child's side, giving comfort and support throughout their stay.&quot;For some parents this may be an overnight stay, but for others it could be much longer, over a period of months or even years.&quot;We are incredibly grateful to Mr and Mrs McBride for their generosity and ongoing support, which has created a fitting legacy for their son Paul McBride QC and which will support many thousands of children and families at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children for many years to come.&quot;

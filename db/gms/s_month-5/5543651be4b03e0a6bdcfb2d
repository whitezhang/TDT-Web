THE threat of trouble at a city nightclub will see dedicated police Â­officers stationed at the venue.&nbsp;Controversial club The Arches was today slammed as it was revealed cops have been forced to mount a major security operation ahead of the long weekend.Police said officers would be working closely with nightclub bosses as the enhanced policing plan is put into place.However, Martin &shy;Docherty, SNP councillor for Anderston and the City Centre, said the move gave him great cause for concern.It comes after a decision was made to review the licence of a controversial nightclub, as revealed by the Evening Times yesterday.Police Scotland asked licensing chiefs to review the Arches' licence after a string of incidents at the high-profile venue.Mr Docherty, the SNP's candidate for West Dunbartonshire, said: &quot;Police Scotland are having to draft in between 60 and 80 extra officers on a Friday and Saturday night to deal with the consequences of the city centre's night-time economy.&quot;The need for additional officers at The Arches gives me great cause for concern.&quot;Meanwhile, source told the Evening Times: &quot;The amount of officers that will be placed at The Arches this weekend, isn't deployed to any other city nightclub or venue.&quot;Pubs and nightclubs can put their hands in their pockets to fund extra officers at their premises, but it is understood The Arches' management have chosen not to do so.Mr Docherty described their decision as very unhelpful.The nightclub's bosses hit back saying their budget does not allow for any further costs&quot;.Last week, Glasgow's licensing board decided the club's licence should be reviewed.Sanctions open to the board include shutting the venue, or curtailing its licensed hours.A decision will be made by the Licensing Board on May 15.A spokesman said: &quot;An application for a premises review hearing on the Arches has been received and it will be considered in the appropriate manner.&quot;Mark Anderson, executive director at The Arches said: &quot;The Arches' zero tolerance drugs policy will be in force as usual over the weekend and we urge all customers to behave responsibly and within the law. Please think about the potential consequences of your actions - you may not just ruin your own night but the night of many others and the very existence of the Arches.&quot;The Arches has in the last year invested significantly in the cost of &shy;additional staffing, from stewarding to welfare experts, as well as ID and early warning technologies, to help mitigate risk at club events. This was as a &shy;result of police recommendations.&quot;As a not-for-profit registered Scottish charity, our budget has not allowed for any further costs to be accrued at this time.&quot;But it has certainly not prevented us from working pro-actively and co-operatively with Police Scotland to maximise safety in the venue.&quot;It comes after a police bid to have the venue closed down permanently was thrown out after it was ruled unlawful.The closure bid came after a woman was found &shy;unconscious and 26 &shy;revellers were nabbed for alleged drugs and booze offences.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland, who is in charge of policing the city centre, said: &quot;I would encourage everyone to use and enjoy the city centre this Bank Holiday weekend, but to do so sensibly, safely, and to show respect to people around you.&quot;We have an enhanced policing plan in place to support the large number of people expected and will be working closely with the Arches to protect public safety.&quot;Our main focus will be to ensure that everyone enjoys the events safely and that those intent on committing any offences, including the use of illegal drugs, are robustly dealt with.&quot;Police ordered a review of the club after Regane MacColl's death in February last year, and its licence hung in the balance then.However, the club kept its licence after bosses said they has acted on the police's recommendations, including a strict over-21s policy.An over-18s rule was later re-instated.Regane, 17, from Clydebank collapsed in the club and died later in hospital.

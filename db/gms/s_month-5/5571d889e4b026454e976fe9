A HISTORIC vote on the ordination of ministers in same-sex civil partnerships is set to dominate the Church of Scotland General Assembly which starts today.
It follows years of deliberation on the issue, which included a vote by all 45 presbyteries of the Church which endorsed the move by 31 votes to 14, and the General Assembly will now have the final say on the proposed change to Church law.
The annual gathering has been held almost every year since the church's inception in 1560.
About 730 commissioners drawn from congregations across Scotland and beyond vote on decisions affecting the direction of the church.
One of the first motions of the General Assembly will be the installation of the new Moderator, Rev Dr Angus Morrison, who was forced to withdraw from the appointment last year after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
Now fully recovered, one of his first tasks will be to chair the vote on the ordination of ministers in same-sex civil partnerships.
Other topics to be discussed at the week-long assembly include tax reform, food banks, mental health, fracking and nuclear weapons.
The ceremonial opening was held last night where this year's Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly, Lord Hope, was given ceremonial keys from the Lord Provost of Edinburgh following a colourful parade.
The 500th anniversary of the birth of John Knox will be marked at the Assembly and a recruitment drive for new ministers will also be a feature.
A special app has also been developed by the Church of Scotland this year to summarise reports from the General Assembly for subscribers.

TWO thugs who barged into an innocent old man’s home and took turns to savagely attack him for no reason were jailed yesterday for four-and-a-half years each.
Ex-policeman Alex Lees, 74, pleaded, “Why? Why me?” as total strangers Gary Ironside and Ryan Jendrycha beat him to a pulp.
The attackers drank “an industrial amount” of alcohol before the attack.
Alex was at home at midday on a Sunday when Jendrycha, 28, and Ironside, 19, forced their way in.
Burly Jendrycha knocked him down, got on top of him and punched him in the face for several minutes.
Ironside then took over, kicking Alex repeatedly in the head and back.
Neither thug said a word during the attack. It took some time afterwards for Alex to realise they had left.
He staggered, covered in blood, to a neighbour’s home, and needed hospital treatment for multiple facial injuries.
Alex loved his home in Dundee’s Hindmarsh Avenue and was liked by his neighbours, but the attack last July left him so traumatised that he had to move.
Ironside assaulted a pedestrian for no reason as the attackers left the house.
He later claimed he went to Alex’s home believing he was going to “sort out a sex offender”. Jendrycha said it was about visiting rights to his child.
But Dundee sheriff Alistair Brown told the thugs: “You didn’t know him.
“He was not an offender of any sort. He had nothing to do with contact difficulties.”
Sheriff Brown said the right sentence was six years each, but he had to give both thugs a discount because they pled guilty early.
Ironside admitted assaulting the pedestrian, Alan Gilmartin. He and Jendrycha, both from Dundee, told the court they were sorry.

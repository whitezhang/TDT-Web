A SCOTTISH FINANCE boss from Edinburgh has been hit with a record &pound;75million fine for mis-selling investment products dubbed “death bonds”.
Stewart Ford, chief executive of now defunct investment firm Keydata, was given the record penalty by City watchdog the Financial Services Authority.
Investigators claim financial advisers misled investors with the investment products, linked to life insurance policies. It said more than 37,000 customers were affected.
Investors lost at least &pound;330million and are currently being refunded by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
 

Keydata collapsed after it could not pay a &pound;12million tax bill.
Former sales director Mark Owen and ex-compliance officer Peter Johnson are set to be fined &pound;4million and &pound;200,000.
The FCA claims the pair and Mr Ford “failed to act with integrity” and misled its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority. They have been banned from working in financial services.
Mr Ford is filing a &pound;650million claim for damages against the FCA and administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers, writes the Mirror.
He said: “We were tossed aside by a regulator which was hell bent on destroying a successful and well-run business.”

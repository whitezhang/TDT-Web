A MAN has died three days after a road crash in which a motorcyclist was killed.
 The collision between the bike and an Alfa Romeo car happened on the A82 north of Tyndrum in Argyll at about 11.30am on Saturday. 
 The 47-year-old man riding the motorcycle was killed while Brian Charles Randall, 63, a passenger in the car, was taken to hospital with serious injuries. 
 Mr Randall, from England, died yesterday in Glasgow's Royal Infirmary as a result of his injuries, police said. 
A report has been sent to the procurator fiscal.

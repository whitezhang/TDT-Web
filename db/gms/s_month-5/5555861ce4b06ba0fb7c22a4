THE SOUTH side is Streets Ahead this month as it prepares for a spring clean.Inspired by our campaign, which helps neighbours and friends get together to improve their local areas, and driven by our partner Clean Glasgow, lots of events are lined up for the next few weeks.Southside Central Area Partnership have teamed up with Clean Glasgow's Local Operational Working Group to deliver the events, after a neighbourhood survey revealed street cleanliness was the key area of concern for residents.More than 300 residents took part in the Southside Central Neighbourhood Management Survey, giving their thoughts on cleansing, road and pavement maintenance, private landlords and youth services.The Area Partnership has joined forces with Clean Glasgow, Keep Scotland Beautiful, Urban Roots, South Seeds, Asda, local schools and McDonald's to deliver community led clean-up's in the areas that need it most.The focus for May is litter - you can join in at Oatlands on May 16, from 10.30am until 1pm (meet at the Model Boat House); at Toryglen on May 27, from 11am to 3pm (meet at Toryglen Community Base) and at the Gorbals on May 30, from 10am until 12.30pm (meet at the Adelphi Centre).For more information on Clean Glasgow and how to get involved call 0300 343 7027 or visit www.cleanglasgow.org.uk.Tell us about your Streets Ahead project by emailing streetsahead@heraldandtimes.co.uk

A MOTORIST is fighting for life after a fireball smash at an accident blackspot campaigners had highlighted to Scotland’s new Transport Minister less than 24 hours before.
The 30-year-old victim was hauled from his burning silver Mazda by two men driving past the crash scene on their way to work.
The crash between the car and a Morrisons supermarket lorry happened around 8.30am on the main A90 dual carriageway at the A937 Marykirk turn-off near Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire.
Last November the A937 which takes in the controversial Laurencekirk south junction was dubbed Scotland’s most dangerous road by the Road Safety Foundation.
On Thursday campaigner Jill Fotheringham, who has spent 11 years calling for a flyover at the A90/A937 junction, met Transport Minister Derek Mackay in Edinburgh.
She was told the minister had the need for improvements “on his radar” and left underwhelmed by the lack of progress.
 

She said: “When I spoke to Mr Mackay he said progress was being made but it’s still a long way off.
“There are way too many hazards at that junction before you even attempt to cross. There’s the pressure of queuing traffic behind you, blind spots, and having to watch four different avenues where traffic can come at you.
“You are also crossing four lanes of one of the busiest roads in Scotland. It’s well known to locals that you approach that junction with a far different attitude to any other road.
“My thoughts are with the latest victim and his family. I do believe he’s serious but I’m hoping he’ll be OK but this just prove we cannot wait any monger for that road to be fixed.
“The last fatality at the junction was 2004 but it’s an absolute miracle that no one’s died there since.”
The Scottish Government said they were committed to identifying “a robust solution for access to Laurencekirk as soon as possible”.
Last night the victim was understood to be in a critical condition in Dundee’s Ninewells Hospital.

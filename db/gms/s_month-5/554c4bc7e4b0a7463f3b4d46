By STEWART PATERSON and HANNAH RODGERONE by one they fell like skittles as Labour's dominance in Glasgow politics came to a spectacular crashing end.The SNP swept to victory in every Glasgow seat in an unprecedented night in the city's political history.First was Glasgow North just after 3 am when Ann McKechin, a former Labour minister, was ousted by Patrick Grady.Mr Grady said he was honoured to be the first SNP MP elected in Glasgow at a General Election. He added:&quot; I don't think I'll be the last&quot;.Over the next hour history was made as Labour MPs with more than 80 years combines experience were defeated and huge majorities overturned.Anas Sarwar the party's former deputy leader, was the last of the seven to go when Glasgow City Councillor Alison Thewliss won Glasgow Central.In Glasgow South, Stewart McDonald defeated Tom Harris and said of his achievement : &quot;Not bad for a boy fae Castlemilk.&quot;He added: &quot;This is a fantastic result not just in Glasgow but across Scotland.&quot;Chris Stephens took Glasgow South West from veteran Labour MP Ian Davidson.In a gracious victory speech Mr Stephens, a trade union activist, praised his predecessor's work in standing up for workers and representing the union movement.Mr Stephens said he would go to Westminster to &quot;argue for better workers rights,&quot; while Mr Davidson applauded the speech.Natalie McGarry, the MP for Glasgow East said: &quot;I would like to thank the constituency for placing their trust in me.&quot;My pledge to you is to be accessible and vocal on your behalf but also listening and active.&quot;This victory is not for me alone; it is for every mother who has queued for a food bank, every member of the disabled community who has had benefits slashed, and for every lone parent who has suffered at the hands of austerity.&quot;Whatever your opinion on Scotland's future may be, we have a lot of work to do.&quot;This election is about sharing the voices of people who live in Glasgow East.&quot;We will fight for an end to austerity and the cuts tearing people's lives apart and some community like those in the east end. &quot;Carol Monaghan, elected in Glasgow North West and a former physics teacher at Hyndland secondary school, said she wanted to give her former pupils the best education possible, but joked &quot;if you're still up watching this just now, it's time to get to bed so you're fresh for study in the morning.&quot;Anne McLaughlin won Glasgow North East the seat which had the biggest Labour majority.She said: &quot;I have pledged in the next couple of months that there is not one person in the constituency who does not know that my office will provide a welfare rights service, and all the support they need should they find themselves in that situation. That is what an MP should be for.&quot;She said the size of her swing broke the BBC swing-o-meter. She joked &quot;I like that.&quot;While the SNP celebrated with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon looking on and congratulating each victorious candidate, Labour figures were devastated.MSPs and councillors looked on in resignation as the ballot papers stacked up and the SNP piles outnumbered the Labour piles.Ian Davidson laid the blame for Labour's loss at the door of Scottish leader Jim Murphy. He criticised the leadership and strategy of the election campaign in Scotland and said he regretted Scottish Labour had &quot;let down our colleagues in the rest of the UK&quot;.Of Mr Murphy, he said &quot;How can he possibly remain.&quot;When he was elected nobody thought he could lose as spectacularly as this.&quot;When asked if Jim Murphy should stand down, Tom Harris was adamant that his party's obliteration in Glasgow was not the Scottish Labour leader's fault.The former MP for Glasgow South said: &quot;The idea that Jim Murphy should take responsibility for this disaster is utter nonsense.&quot;There is nothing Jim, or any other leader, could have done to stop this happening.&quot; He added that the &quot;Scottish public&quot; were responsible for tonight's outcome, which saw the SNP claim all seven of Glasgow's seats.&quot;I have no idea [what's gone wrong].&quot; he said, sighing.&quot;It's four in the morning, I have just lost a 12,000 majority, I have no answers for anything.&quot;This has been a revenge vote against the Labour party because we are the obstacle to independence.&quot;Margaret Curran, who lost her seat to the SNP's Natalie McGarry by an overwhelming 10,387 votes, said she still thought Labour could come back.She said: &quot;Of course I'm disappointed but I'll tell you one thing that I absolutely believe.&quot;There is great social and economic injustice in Scotland, we need to think about problems within Scotland.&quot;Tonight I think has been a clash of nationalisms, but to me the bigger cause, the greater cause, is inequality and you will always have the Labour party to fight that.&quot;Mr Sarwar also said the struggle would continue.He said: &quot;The fight for social justice and Labour values right across the UK goes on.&quot;I say to those who still believe in those values, you still have a voice and a champion in Labour.&quot;Others hurried from the Hall following the declarations.Willie Bain, the one Labour MP who was thought most likely to survive an SNP onslaught, left in silence.

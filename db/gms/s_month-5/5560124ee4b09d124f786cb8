@HannahwritesHTPREPARATION on a city car park has been stalled by developers due to urgent contractual issues.Work to get Buchanan Galleries car park ready for its redevelopment came to a standstill on Monday, the Evening Times understands.When asked, developers Land Securities said the sudden halt was due to contracts being finalised, but refused to give further details.A spokeswoman said: &quot;We never comment on contractual arrangements until they have been finalised.&quot;When asked about the latest interruption to the preparation work, the firm failed to confirm why the contracts had not been finalised prior to the work commencing, or if the pause would delay the closure of the facility and subsequent development.As reported in the Evening Times, members of the public were being informed by car park staff last week it was due to shut on May 31.Yet Land Securities bosses said the information must have been a mistake, prompting criticism from city politicians who called for further clarification.The developers are proposing to close the 2,000 space facility and redirect motorists to nearby Concert Square car park, which holds around 700 vehicles.They also said other facilities in the city centre will be available to use, and currently the Buchanan Galleries car park is not full to capacity.Yesterday the firm were still unable to give the final closing date of the 2,000 space facility, which is set to make way for a new &pound;400m extension to the shopping centre.Car park staff also said they were now unsure of the date, but said it might be the end of May, or the first week in June.The latest interruption is another in a series of mysteries surrounding when the facility will be officially closed.Meanwhile, Glasgow City Council have announced changes to the layout of a city centre street to allow for work on the shopping centre to take place.From Monday June 1 there will be no left turn into North Hanover Street from George Square for motorists, except buses and taxis.Queen Street Railway station car park is accessible, however drivers who want to access the station entrance will have to drive south down North Hanover Street towards George Square.The car park itself is unable to be used by visitors.A ScotRail spokesman said: &quot;The car park outside the North Hanover Street entrance at Glasgow Queen Street station closed in early May as part of the Buchanan Galleries Shopping Centre renovation project.&quot;It will remain closed while Buchanan Galleries constructs an 11-storey building on the site, including a new multi-storey car park.&quot;About 20 customer parking spaces at the station have been removed to allow construction work to begin. The customers affected were individually informed in advance.&quot;Taxis and disabled passengers will still be able to get into Queen Street station from North Hanover street for a few weeks until alternatives are arranged on George Street.The local authority are warning motorists of the bus lane camera on North Hanover Street.A spokeswoman said: &quot; Drivers should be aware that there is a bus lane on North Hanover Street with an enforcement camera and anyone ignoring the no left turn could find themselves driving in the bus lane.&quot;It is an offence for anyone but authorised vehicles to drive in a bus lane.&quot;If a driver is found to be illegally driving in a bus lane a charge will be issued.&quot;The taxi rank, usually located in the station car park has moved to George Street outside the Millennium hotel, and seven new disabled parking bays have been created on the north side of the square.Another taxi rank has been created on George Street across from Queen Street Railway Station.

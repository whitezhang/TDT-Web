ALLY KELLOCK ended his rugby career as the “proudest man in the world”.
Glasgow won the Pro 12 trophy with a thumping 31-13 win against Munster in Belfast.
Cult hero Kellock ended his glittering career by inspiring Glasgow to their greatest triumph in Scottish rugby in a quarter of a century.
Not since the Grand Slam of 1990 have Scots oval ball fans been able celebrate so wildly.
Skipper Kellock, who came off the bench to make his farewell appearance, said: “What a way to finish – in every respect.
“I couldn’t have written a better script for the team or myself on a landmark day.
“I am unbelievably proud, in fact no man in the world could be more proud.
“I am proud of what we have achieved in becoming the first Scottish side to win a professional title.
“And I am proud of the way we did it with a spectacular brand of rugby.
“We worked so hard to top the league in the regular season then worked so hard to win the semi against Ulster.
“Again here we underlined what an amazing work ethic this team have. Some of the skills we showed in the first half defied belief.
“We knew we had to attack Munster because they are such a powerful team who never give up. We knew what their strengths would be but this was all about ours strengths, mentally and physically. We had to impose our own style.”
Kellock shrugged off his emotions and said: “This is not about me – more than 50 players were involved.
“Each and every one of them played his part. We play as a team, we lose as a team – and we have won as a team.
“This is not the time for any personal reflection. This is the time for the guys to celebrate as we played – together.
“Several of the lads are moving on and that was a big incentive to work for this win.”
Kellock was backed up by coach Gregor Townsend who said: “Every single man rose to the occasion as they have done all season.
“We had a game plan and the guys followed it and produced some very good rugby.
“The first-half display was out of the top drawer.”

Ryanair said that the group – believed to be heading for the notorious beach resort of Magaluf – were “unruly and disruptive” during the two-and-a-half journey on Thursday.

“It was shocking behaviour.”
Ryanair said: “We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour and we sincerely apologised to other customers for any inconvenience caused.
“The safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.”

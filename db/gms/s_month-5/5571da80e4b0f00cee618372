A FOOTBALLER has denied hitting a man with a baseball bat – but admitted punching him.
Livingston defender Declan Gallagher, 24, claimed he struck Steven Findlay, 45, to protect his father.
Gallagher had been at a party at the Parkville Hotel in Blantyre, Lanarkshire, when violence erupted.
He told jurors at Hamilton Sheriff Court he punched Steven to the ground and that his dad then fell over the top of him.
Gallagher, of Dundee, and his uncle Anthony Murray, 29, from Blantyre, both deny repeatedly punching and kicking Steven on the head and body, knocking him to the ground and striking him on the head with a baseball bat or similar implement to his severe injury and danger of life in April 2013.
Both claim self-defence.
Giving evidence, Gallagher said fighting had started outside the hotel and he had left but later returned with his father and Murray.
He said: “Steven Findlay was across the street and I heard him say, ‘There’s the woman beater, are you back for more?’, to Anthony.
“My dad stepped in front of Anthony and me saying that’s enough. Steven acted aggressively towards my dad, stepping into his face.
“I punched him with my right hand and he fell to the ground and a group of guys came charging towards us.” Gallagher claimed that in the melee that followed, he saw an unknown man use a bat to hit Steven.
He added: “I tried to get my dad up off the ground but there was a lot of people throwing punches and hitting other people.
“I didn’t have any weapons but I saw a man who I didn’t know with a baseball bat wearing dark clothing.
“The bat was about 2ft and he struck Steven on the head with the bat. I saw him hit him twice. I did not hit anyone with a baseball bat.”
Ex-Celtic youth Gallagher told the jury his trial had effected his career. He added: “I hope to move club but I haven’t found one, this trial is stopping that.”
The trial continues.

A DOG found at the top of the highest mountain in England by a Scottish couple has been reunited with his owners.
The collie cross was discovered at the summit of Scafell Pike in the Lake District last weekend by the holidaymakers.
They took him home to Maybole in Ayrshire after failing to get help and alerted the Scottish SPCA.
The animal welfare charity issued an appeal because the dog wasn’t microchipped.
Nicknamed Scafell by staff at the rescue and rehoming centre in Glasgow, the dog, whose real name is Sid, has now been returned to his owner.
Centre assistant manager Katrina Cavanagh said: “The couple who found Sid told us he was petrified and they brought him home because they couldn’t get help locally.

“Unfortunately, Sid wasn’t microchipped so we couldn’t contact his owner directly.
 

“Thankfully, he came forward following our appeal and arranged for Sid to be collected as he wasn’t able to travel to Glasgow.”
She added: “The owner is a local sheep farmer and Sid is one of his working dogs.
“He believes Sid took off after a bitch in season and had been looking for him.
“While he was surprised when he found out Sid was in Scotland, he was also very relieved he was safe.
“He’s a lovely dog and we wouldn’t have had any trouble finding him a home if we’d needed to as we had lots of offers.
“This is another example of why it’s important for pets to be microchipped.”

One in eight adults north of border have been hit by scammers in the past year, insolvency trade experts have found.
The report by R3 compares revealed an average fraud rate of one in nine people across the UK.
The Scottish figure was equal to that of the north west of England and only London had a higher level of fraud, where one in six people have been a victim.

Scotland chair for R3 said: &quot;It may be surprising that younger generations are the most likely victims of fraud, but online fraud does place younger age groups at risk.&quot;It's important consumers don't take things at face value, especially online.&quot;

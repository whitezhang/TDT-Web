DURING World War II a forgotten group of young heroes played a vital role in keeping the city safe.And next month, members of their families will gather in Glasgow to pay tribute to those who lost their lives.During the German bombing raids on Glasgow and Clydebank the Fire Brigade attended many incidents and lost many men.What is less well known is that when fire service communications failed during the raids, young boys volunteered to take messages back from the fire to the area headquarters.Some made the journey on bike while others ran through the falling bombs.One was Neil Leitch from Partick, who along with four others, was killed while bravely trying to get a message through.The youngster, despite being injured, set off to deliver his message to Partick fire station but was hit by a high explosive oil bomb which left him severely burned and fatally injured.Neil was singled out for his gallantry and was awarded a commendation for Conspicuous Gallantry from King George VI.The boys of the blitz were also honoured by then Glasgow Lord Provost Patrick Dollan who had a Celtic cross erected in Dalbeth cemetery although sadly, Neil is the only one buried there.On May 20, the messenger boy's family will gather in the graveyard to pay tribute to the youngster.Among them will be Neil's nephew James Leitch, a former Clydebank fireman who now lives in Orkney.James follows a long family tradition as his father and grandfather were firemen in Glasgow and his great grandfather a firefighter in London.He has researched his uncle's short life and discovered he died in 1941 at the age of only 15 in a brave attempt to get a message to a fire crew battling one of the many blazes of the blitz.His heroism is recorded in a letter dated March 18 that year which was sent by Adjutant S.P.Smith of the Corporation of Glasgow public health department to fire service chief officer Martin.It reads: &quot;I felt it my duty to inform you of an example of devotion to duty on the part of a member of your service. I refer to Boy Messenger Neil Leitch who was attached to the fire station in Sandy Road.&quot;I personally attended to the boy on each of his two visits to this post.&quot;Following the destruction of Bankhead auxilliary fire service depot he was sent out with a message while the raid was at its height.&quot;On his way back to his station he was blown off his bicycle by bomb blast and was brought to this post for treatment.&quot;The left elbow and knee had been struck and after attending to these injuries I ordered him to the rest room for an hour or so to recover from shock.&quot;He pressed to be allowed to return to his place of duty but realising his condition and hearing a considerable amount of shrapnel falling on the roof of this building, I insisted on his remaining here.&quot;Six or seven minutes later he was brought back stripped of all his clothing and his face, chest and abdomen and thighs so terribly burnt there could be no hope of saving his life.&quot;Apparently he had met the full blast of the bomb which fell outside the Sandy Road fire station.&quot;He bore his dreadful agony with great fortitude and during it, even expressed his regret for disobeying my order but knew with certainty where his duty lay.&quot;In short, I would say his first injuries would hae been a sufficient excuse for most men to take advantage of the period of rest offered to Neil but with bravery and selfless devotion to duty he set off for his post.&quot;I am sure you will feel proud you had so splendid a boy in your service and that you will not miss this opportunity of acquainting the authorities of his heroic service and recommending him for the highest honour.&quot;And I am further sure you will not fail to soften his parents sense of loss by sending them an official record of their son's exemplary conduct.&quot;Neil was one of around 90 messenger boys in Glasgow who volunteered to help the war effort.Mr Leitch is hoping some of them or their families will be able to attend the brief remembrance ceremony at the cemetery on May 20.He said: &quot;Some of these boys will still be alive and we would like them or their families to come along and join us at the cemetery at 11am.&quot;Among those paying tribute will be Lord Provost Sadie Docherty who said: &quot;The remarkable bravery of Neil Leitch and all the other boy cyclists across the country, who put their lives on the line to save others during the Second World War is little known.&quot;It's incredibly moving that these young men were prepared to embark on these dangerous missions.&quot;Sadly Neil Leitch paid the ultimate price. It's right that we remember and pay our respects to him and others like him.&quot;I am yours faithfully.

 BREAKING Bad actress Laura Fraser broke new ground when she drove in the first spade at a Ceremony for the Prince and Princess of Wales brand new Hospice in Bellahouston Park . 
New patron Laura, who plays crystal meth queen Lydia Rodarte-Quayle in Breaking Bad, admitted it felt odd to brandish a shovel, wellies and hard hat for the launch as she joined Minister for Sport, Health Improvement and Mental Health, Jamie Hepburn at the ceremony which also launched the Hospice’s Foundations Appeal.

 The Glasgow born actress said: &quot;Breaking Bad wasn't as difficult as this. &quot; 
Once the initial groundwork is complete, the foundations will be laid for the new building.
The Hospice’s fundraising team has already raised two thirds of the &pound;1 million needed for the foundations alone but the Hospice urgently need to raise the remaining &pound;330,000 in order to complete the foundation work.
 
Outgrowing the much-loved building in Carlton Place, the Hospice is expanding its vision to look after young people, as well as all of the adult patients and their families for decades to come.
The Foundations Appeal is turning to the people of Glasgow and it’s supporters for the help to build a new home for the city’s Hospice. The brand new, purpose-built Hospice will bring 21st century Hospice care to the people of Glasgow who will benefit from support at the most difficult times of their lives.
 
Everyone will be invited to play their part in the Foundation Appeal by putting their heart in the new Hopsice. Message hearts will be taken from all over the city and placed in the foundations of the new building underneath the main entrance to the new Hospice
Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice Chief Executive, Rhona Baillie, Glasgow City Council Leader Gordon Matheson and Lord Provost, Sadie Docherty also attended.

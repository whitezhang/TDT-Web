A 75-year-old is one of six men set to stand trial in Dundee accused of dealing drugs in Scotland and England.
Denis McAinsh, of Glasgow, will stand trial alongside Alexander Chaplin, 51; Barry Jeffrey, 32; and Michael Chaplin, 50, all of Dundee; and James McGing, 50, also of Glasgow.
All deny charges of supplying cannabis over a period of more than a year.
A warrant was issued for a sixth man - Dean Holmes, 46, of Dundee - after he failed to appear in court.
All six men face an allegation that they were concerned in the supply of cannabis between August 2013 and September 2014 at addresses in Dundee, Berwick railway station, the M90 near Glenfarg in Perthshire, and other locations unknown.
Alexander Chaplin and Dean Holmes face a further charge of producing cannabis at addresses in Dundee, while Barry Jeffrey is also accused of dealing cocaine in the city.
Sheriff Lorna Drummond QC continued the case to a further pre-trial hearing next week.

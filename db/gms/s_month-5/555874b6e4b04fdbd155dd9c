 WARRIORS playmaker Finn  Russell ran riot against Ulster – then dedicated his team’s wonder show to their  “amazing” fans. 
 He grabbed a 22-point haul as Glasgow outgunned the Irish side to finish at the top of the Pro12 table and earn a home play-off semi-final against the same opponents. 
A jubilant Russell said: “The  supporters were fantastic – they  definitely made a big difference when we needed to up our performance.
“We wanted to do it for them and  we hope they will create the same  atmosphere next weekend.”
Russell, who snatched two tries and landed a spate of vital kicks, added: “We were four points down at the  interval and knew we had to be patient with the strong wind at our backs. It was all about playing cleverly and thankfully we got some momentum and made the most of it.
“It was a great win – but we know Ulster will be doubly determined to get back at us next week.”
The Warriors’ prospects had  looked bleak after a shaky first half at squally Scotstoun.
But they thrilled the 10,000 crowd with a stunning late show which produced four memorable tries to floor Ulster and make sure of the crucial bonus point.
With the wind at their backs, the visitors were 10-6 up at the break, thanks to a try from Chris Henry. Warriors coach Gregor Townsend emptied his bench in a desperate bid to add fresh impetus.
 And within seconds they clicked into gear with a piece of Stuart Hogg  magic. He had to stretch to clutch a floated pass from Russell before sending a chip towards the line. 
His pace took him there first, the bounce was kind for the Warriors’ ace and the finish clinical.
Even better was to come when Russell the provider became Russell the scorer, dodging past four markers on his 15-metre mazy run.
He added the extras for good measure – then repeated those heroics to set up the most tense finale possible.
And Scotstoun shook to the rafters as the bulk of the crowd erupted in glee as they watched Richie Vernon gallop in for the all-important fourth.

THE body of a battered dog was found in a pond in Newmains.The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after the young female Staffordshire bull terrier was discovered in water near Overtown Road in the North Lanarkshire town.A post-mortem revealed the dog had been struck on the head, neck and body.The dog had been weighed down with two large slab-like stones before being dumped in the water.The animal was found on Friday May 15.Inspector Heather Lawson said, &quot;The dog had been in the water for 24 to 48 hours before she was discovered.&quot;Although the trauma to her head and neck was significant it would have been unlikely to be the cause of death, which is unexplained at this stage.&quot;It is not yet known if she was still breathing when she entered the water.&quot;The dog had been weighed down with two large, slab-like stones which had been tied to her lead.&quot;She was a young brown female Staffordshire bull terrier type and other than her injuries was in good bodily condition.&quot;She was a very unusual colour for this breed as this shade of brown is more commonly seen in Patterdale terriers or chocolate Labradors.&quot;We would appeal to anyone who recognises the description of this dog and knows who may have done this to her to contact us on 03000 999 999.&quot;

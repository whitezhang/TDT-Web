ROWERS and boat owners have been advised not to travel under Polmadie pedestrian bridge which has been closed for safety reasons.&quot;Two weeks ago, engineers discovered the concrete beams in the middle were in poor condition and closed it to the public.At the time, a council spokesman said: &quot;We've closed the bridge as a precaution after a regular inspection found it was potentially unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists.&quot;Since then it has been monitored daily and a decision has now been taken to ask water users to steer clear of the bridgeThe spokesman added: &quot;We have now advised river users not to row under it. The decision to restrict pedestrians and river users from travelling under the structure has been taken with their best interests in mind.&quot;

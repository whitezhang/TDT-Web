 TWO police officers have been seriously injured after crashing their car during a high speed chase. 
 The marked police car was chasing a Mini when it hit a traffic island and three parked cars before smashing into a private garden in Drum Brae Drive, Edinburgh at 4am on Thursday. 
Both officers were seriously injured and are being treated at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. Their injuries are not life threatening.
Chief inspector Stephen Innes said: &quot;We can confirm that a police vehicle was involved in a road traffic collision on Drum Brae Drive, Edinburgh at around 4am today while in pursuit of a Mini.
&quot;Two officers sustained various injuries after the vehicle collided with a traffic island, three parked vehicles before coming to rest in a private garden.
&quot;The officers are currently receiving treatment at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary and enquiries into the full circumstances of this incident are currently ongoing.&quot;
Police are now trying to find the Mini involved in the incident.
Chief superintendent Mark Williams said: &quot;This collision resulted in serious injuries for the officers involved and it is testament to their skill and courage that it wasn't even worse.
&quot;This incident also highlights the absolute recklessness and selfishness of these criminals, who have no concern for the safety of themselves or the public.
&quot;We are focusing on finding those responsible as a priority, and i would encourage anyone who remembers seeing this Mini, or who has any other information that can assist us in our investigations to track these individuals down, to get in touch immediately.&quot;

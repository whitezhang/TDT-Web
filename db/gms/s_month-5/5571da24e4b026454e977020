THE Sunday Mail Young Scot Awards was yet another truly fantastic night to celebrate some of Scotland's most inspiring and brave young people.
 As the tenth anniversary of the awards show got underway at Edinburgh's Usher Hall, there were tears, laughter and applause for some of our brightest stars including Jamie McIntosh, winner of the health award, Mark Flood who scooped the Enterprise award and our Unsung Hero, Kevin Martin. 
 As Jak Truman's name was read out for the title of Young Scot 2015, there was a standing ovation for his fantastic family who picked up the award on his behalf. 
And the host of celebrities who arrived to hang out with the true stars of the night, were overwhelmed by the amazing stories of our young Scots who had battled illness, dealt with the loss of a parent and overcame a difficult upbringing to turn their lives around.
 

Louise Macdonald, chief executive of Young Scot, said: “This year’s Young Scot Awards has been the biggest celebration of Scotland’s young people to date, which is testament to the incredible work young Scots have done over the last 10 years.
It’s important that the hard work and dedication of every Young Scot nominee over the past 10 years is carried on by other young people in communities across the country.
“It’s equally important we recognise the achievements of these inspirational young people and celebrate them every day.”
 

Sunday Mail editor Jim Wilson said Jak Trueman’s life was far too short but his legacy will help young people and their families for years go come.
He added: “It is an honour to help salute Jak and our other winners and finalists.
“Once again, our Young Scots have shown the future of our country could not be in safer hands.”

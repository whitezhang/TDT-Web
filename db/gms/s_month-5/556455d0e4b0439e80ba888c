PHONE provider O2 has said it will launch a “full investigation” after people across the UK, including in parts of Glasgow and Edinburgh, lost signal to their mobile phones.
Business Secretary Sajid Javid was among the disgruntled customers who lost reception on Monday - some for up to five hours - and told the company to “sort it out” on Twitter.
Signal problems were reported in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester, Bristol, Birmingham and parts of Northern Ireland and London.
Normal service was restored shortly before midnight on Monday night and the provider said it would be trying to identify the source of the disruption.
It said in a statement on Tuesday: “Further to our previous messages where some customers experienced some problems accessing our network, we can confirm that service returned to normal at 23.35 yesterday.
“We apologise for any inconvenience caused to those customers affected and we will now begin a full investigation to identify the root cause.”
Customers were advised to switch their phones on and off if they were still experiencing difficulties, as O2 apologised to people on Twitter.
O2 customer service staff suggested rebooting phones to solve the problems as annoyed customers took to social media to vent their frustration.

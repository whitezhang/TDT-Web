By DIANE LAWLERROSS Benson is bucking the trend in the beauty industry.Ross, 25, was the only male to graduate from a new Princes Trust course that aims to help vulnerable youngsters get a foothold in the beauty industry.The four-week course, which is the only one of its kind in the UK, aims to help students gain jobs in the beauty industry, providing links to hairdressers, salons and beauty counters.The 12 students spent three days learning beauty techniques in the Renfield Street salon while the other four were spent gaining practical work experience on placements in barbers, hairdressers and spas.Ross, who is from Glasgow, said: &quot;At first I was worried about being excluded but everyone was in the same boat so I wasn't singled out.&quot;The course was really informative and I actually found lots of new interests.&quot;We worked really closely with Lynne who ran the course and she was great.&quot;Ross now plans on undertaking another Princes Trust course, on Business Enterprise before starting a barbering course in September.Lynne Hetherington, MD of the Beauty Therapy Academy said: &quot;Ross was great. A very articulate boy who got on really well in the class.&quot;This was such an inspiring course to deliver as I had 14 young individuals who demonstrated a desire to change their lives.&quot;

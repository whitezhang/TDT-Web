AN animal welfare charity is trying to trace the owner of a dog found at the top of England's highest mountain by holidaymakers who took him home to Scotland.
The couple found the male collie cross at the summit of Scafell Pike in the Lake District on Saturday.
They tried to get help in England without success so took him home to Maybole, South Ayrshire, before alerting the Scottish SPCA.
The dog, thought to be aged between five and eight, is now being cared for at the charity's animal rescue and rehoming centre in Glasgow, where staff have nicknamed him Scafell.
Centre manager Anna O'Donnell said: &quot;The couple who found Scafell said he was petrified and nervous and it took them around half-an-hour to coax him over to them.
&quot;They advised they did try and get help in England and have called the police but they hadn't been able to assist so they took Scafell home because they were so worried about him, and then called us.
&quot;Unfortunately Scafell isn't microchipped so we have been unable to trace his owner.
&quot;We have also searched for information about dogs who have gone missing in the area with no luck.&quot;
 

It is not known how the dog ended up at the top of the mountain.
Miss O'Donnell said: &quot;At this stage it's all a bit of a mystery but we believe Scafell may have been taken up the mountain by his owner and become lost. There is also a chance he was abandoned and made his own way up to the top of Scafell Pike.
&quot;It would be fantastic if we are able to reunite him with his owner if he has gone missing. If not we will find him a loving new home in Scotland.&quot;

HUNDREDS of people are demanding speed limits across the city be cut to 20mph.Recently, Edinburgh City Council announced it is to make all their residential streets mandatory 20mph zones at an estimated cost of &pound;2.2m.A petition signed by 222 people has now been lodged with Glasgow councillors demanding they follow the lead of the capital.It insists lower speeds encourage more considerate driving, leading to safer streets for pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.The petition says: &quot;The current mode of 20mph implementation in Glasgow is to reduce speeds only on selected residential streets and only after the installation of costly traffic calming measures.&quot;If Glasgow City Council maintains this approach, it will take many years and significant expenditure before 20mph speed limits become the norm across the city.&quot;Edinburgh has recently decided to by-pass the street-by-street approach by making 20mph the default speed limit on 80% of its streets and without the installation of traffic calming measures.&quot;Edinburgh citizens can look forward to calmer roads where walking and cycling become considerably more attractive options.&quot;Overall, there will be less traffic congestion, better health, less noise, more social interaction and stronger communities.&quot;In the event of accidents, the lowered speed will significantly reduce the likelihood of death or serious injury.&quot;Glasgow could reap similar benefits by following Edinburgh's lead and plan for a similar city-wide reduction in speed limits.&quot;The Department of Transport say someone hit by a car at 40mph has a 30% chance of being killed, is 7% likely to be killed if hit at 30mph but has only a 1% chance of dying if hit at 20mph.Andy Waddell, the city council's head of infrastructure services said Glasgow is in the process of implementing mandatory 20mph zones in residential areas.Since 2011, the council has introduced 20mph zones in 54 areas covering 84 miles of residential roads. A further 11 zones will be introduced by June this year covering a further 17 miles of roads.There are also plans to introduce a mandatory 20mph zone in Dowanhill with no traffic calming features in the next financial year.And funding is is place to introduce a 20mph limit in the city centre during the present financial year.Until recently, the Scottish Government insisted 20mph zones must have traffic calming measures. That has now changed in areas where speeds are already on average 24mph or lower.However the rules may be changed again by a new piece of legislation which is soon to be publishedMr Waddell's report says: &quot;The council is working towards making all suitable residential roads mandatory 20mph zones or limits in line with current resources.&quot;The council will continue to monitor the various options available to restrict speeds in residential areas and continue to use appropriate methods of speed reduction as we progress to our road safety vision.&quot;He points out the council is waiting for the publication of the new regulations before carrying out a review of its current policies.

Health Secretary Shona Robison admitted that she was thoroughly impressed by the new South Glasgow University Hospital after receiving a tour.The Health Secretary visited the new &pound;842 million hospital yesterday including the Royal Hospital for Sick Children which is due to begin receiving patients early next month.Ms Robison was taken through the colourful outpatient department of the children's hospital and shown the array of interactive wall installations which were funded by theYorkhill Children's Charity and provided by the Glasgow science Centre.During the tour Ms Robison met with nursing staff from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to discuss a new nursing care system currently being trialled.The health board is one of the first in the country to trial the new system which gives frontline nurses and midwives more decision-making powers in order to give senior nurses and midwives more time to spend on wards.It is hoped that the new system, known as the Care Assurance and Accreditation System, will release senior staff from their office-based functions to spend more time with patients.The MSP for Dundee East was shown through the 14 storey hospital and stopped by the surgical department at ward 9 where she met one of the ward's first patients, Mr Thomas Scott, 87, from Kirkintilloch.Mr Scott, who was the last patient to leave the old Southern General hospital, has been in hospital for nine weeks now and he told Ms Robison that he was amazed by the new hospital and its staff.Ms Robison rounded off her stop with a tour of the emergency departments before discussing her first impressions of the hospital.She said: &quot;It's fantastic when you first walk in and see the atrium, you can't help but think wow. The waiting area in the children's hospital was amazing, I could have spent hours there.&quot;The hospital is one of most state of the art and best designed healthcare facilities in the world. This is a 21 century hospital with some of the best technology anywhere.&quot;This new technology will help to free up staff time and improve the patient's experience of the hospital care. The single rooms are very good for infection control and the layout of the hospital is excellent too, it will speed up the flow of the patients through the hospital and help ensure patients are dealt with quickly.When asked about the new hospital's ability to met A&amp;E waiting time targets Ms Robison said: &quot;I was very impressed by the emergency department and it's ability to meet targets. It has a bigger capacity than all of the hospitals it's replacing and I think the flow of the hospital is equally important.NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Chairman, Andrew Robertson, accompanied the Health Secretary on her tour. Afterwards he said: &quot;This hospital has been entirely funded by the Scottish Government and has been successful at every stage. The hospital was finished 5 weeks early and within budget. The contractors and everyone involved in the planning and building stage have done a remarkable job.

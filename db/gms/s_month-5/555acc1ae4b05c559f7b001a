DETECTIVES are today attempting to establish the motive behind a fire attack on a Turkish barber shop.As revealed in late editions of yesterday's Evening Times, Gogo's Barbers in Glasgow was torched in a late night attack on Sunday.Flames quickly gripped the premises and neighbours raised the alarm after smoke was spotted coming from the premises in the city centre.Police yesterday revealed the blaze, which swept through the barber shop in Cambridge Street, had been started deliberately.Cops are now probing possible motives, including any potential business rivals or raiders who may have broken in.Meanwhile, families from seven flats above the shop were allowed to return home after being evacuated.Detective Sergeant Alister Thom, who is leading the investigation, said: &quot;This was a dangerous act and could easily have resulted in a more serious outcome.&quot;Our investigations are at early stage but I am keen to speak to a male seen in the area shortly before the fire was reported.&quot;The male is described as between 40 and 50 years old with a stocky build.&quot;He was wearing an orange puffa jacket with a white t-shirt and blue jeans.&quot;I would ask this man or anyone who saw him, or anything suspicious to contact police.&quot;Witnesses who may have seen the man loitering around the barber shop before 10pm on Sunday have been urged to come forward.A Scottish Fire and Rescue spokesman said: &quot;We received a 999 call shortly after 9.50pm reporting a fire in a shop beneath flats in Cambridge Street.&quot;Two crews were immediately sent from Cowcaddens along with two more from Maryhill and firefighters reached the scene three minutes later.&quot;A team of two entered the property in breathing apparatus and extinguished the fire using a main jet.&quot;Our crews used a positive pressure ventilation fan to clear smoke from the premises and checked for any hidden fire spread by cutting away and using a thermal imaging camera.&quot;Officers from our specialist fire investigation unit attended and will work closely with police to establish the circumstances surrounding the fire.&quot;Anyone with any information about the fire is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.

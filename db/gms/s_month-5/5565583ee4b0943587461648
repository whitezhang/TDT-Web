A GOVANHILL community group has vowed "not to stop" in its campaign to improve the area after meeting Nicola Sturgeon.Liz Armour, Fiona Jordan and Frances Stojilkovic from the Let's Save Govanhill group met the First Minister at her constituency office on Pollokshaws Road yesterday to appeal for extra help in their fight against crime, poverty and degradation.The group, which started in January, called on Ms Sturgeon to use her powers as First Minister to regenerate and renew the area.Group secretary, Fiona Jordan, 55, said: &quot;We will not stop campaigning until there is some real change - we are calling on Nicola Sturgeon to act not as the local MSP but as First Minister of Scotland.&quot;How can she govern a country if she can't even look after Govanhill?&quot;She has promised us meetings with all the key decision-makers in the government, police and council but we want action - the time for talk is over.&quot;The Evening Times reported that over 1000 homes in the area are affected by bed-bugs and a &quot;block-by-block&quot; deep clean had been ordered.Group organiser Frances Stojilkovic, 52, a care assistant, said: &quot;There is rubbish, rats and bed bugs in this area that we have to deal with everyday. The amount of rubbish is unbelievable.&quot;&quot;Nicola Sturgeon recognised the problems and has vowed to get us meetings with all the key people to try and make changes.&quot;Ms Stojilkovic believes that fear has gripped the community and that many refuse to walk down the streets alone.She said: &quot;My Mum is 80 and I won't let her walk down the street on her own, she still has her mobility but I have had to say to her to stay inside, it's a complete shame.&quot;The group is planning further protests if their demands are not met.Ms Jordan said: &quot;We are planning a march on the city chambers in July if the situation does not improve and then we are taking our campaign to Holyrood in August.&quot;This is just the start.&quot;Meanwhile, the group has helped local resident Anne McGarrigle move back into her home after it was ransacked by thieves over a month ago.As reported in The Evening Times last week Ms McGarrigle was forced to take refuge with her neighbour after her house was broken into.Local residents helped clean the house and have donated &pound;100 toward a new TV.Ms Frances Stojilkovic, said: &quot;Her neighbours have cleared the house for her but she is obviously still very frightened and scared.&quot;She is a well known member of the community so everyone was shocked to hear what happened to her.&quot;She has our phone numbers and we've told her to call anytime if she needs our help.&quot;Nicola Sturgeon was not immediately available for comment.

 THE husband of a Nationalist MP who unseated Jim Murphy amid the SNP landslide has proved there is little loyalty in politics - after joining the LABOUR party. 
SNP MP Kirsten Oswald persuaded thousands of voters to support her Westminster bid in East Renfrewshire as she ousted the Scottish Labour leader but has yet to win over her husband.
Her spouse Davinder Bedi joined the Labour Party yesterday and announced his decision on Facebook.
Mr Bedi, 45, who lives in East Renfrewshire with Oswald and their two children, said he opposed independence and insisted Scottish Labour should break away from the UK party.
 Writing on the ‘Scottish Labour for Scotland’ Facebook page , he said: “Dear friends, and I do regard you as friends albeit that I have never met you, yesterday I joined the party and I’m glad I did because I want to help effect change.” 
“I want my party (this party) to be truly representative of our people - Scots. I want a party which is fundamentally opposed to independence yet one which is ready to lead in Scotland should that occur. A party which looks after Scots and speaks for Scottish people and Scottish businesses. Perhaps one which is aligned to the UK Labour Party rather than integrated with it. Definitely one which can help the UK Labour movement to win power and change people’s lives.”
Party members welcomed Mr Bedi and urged him to get involved in his local party activities.
 An SNP spokeswoman said: “The days of husbands and wives voting the same way are long gone. 
“We are very satisfied at winning half of the popular vote in Scotland and 56 of the 59 seats.”

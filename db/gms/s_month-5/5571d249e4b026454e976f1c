 THE number of people picked up for drink-driving FELL after the lower limit was brought in , it was revealed yesterday. 
Police recorded 997 offences from January to March – a 17 per cent fall from 1209 over the same period last year.
 The figures were recorded after the legal drink-drive limit was reduced in December from 80mg to 50mg in every 100ml of blood, in line with most of the rest of Europe. 
It means one drink could put a motorist over the limit.
As they launched their annual crackdown, Police &shy;Scotland warned drivers to keep off the booze if they plan to drive.
Chief Superintendent Iain Murray, head of road policing, said: “Police stop more than 20,000 &shy;Scottish drivers a month. That’s one vehicle every two minutes.
“If you have committed an offence, or if we have reasonable cause to suspect that you have been drinking, you may be subjected to a breath test.
“Even if you’re just over the limit, you’re still a drunk-driver in the eyes of the law. There is no grey area. This may affect your current and future employment, and can have wider implications for other areas of your life.”
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson, said: “Since the introduction of the new lower drink-drive limit six months ago, Scotland is starting to see a real change in behaviour.
“Fewer drink-driving offences is a positive story for Scotland.”

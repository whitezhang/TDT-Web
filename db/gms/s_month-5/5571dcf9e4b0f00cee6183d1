A MOTORIST has been charged with assault after a van driver was attacked during a road rage incident.
The 53-year-old man was allegedly set upon by the other driver after he overtook him in the inside lane on the Edinburgh city bypass earlier this month.
The incident caused huge delays in the area when the van driver was unable to drive following the altercation on Friday April 17.
A spokesman for Police Scotland said: &quot;Police in Edinburgh have arrested a 43-year-old man in connection with a road range incident on the A720 City Bypass on Friday, April 17.
&quot;He has been charged under the Road Traffic Act and with assault, and will appear at court at a later date.&quot;

SERIOUS concerns remain over safety at Faslane despite assurances from the UK defence Secretary according to Alex Salmond.Michael Fallon dismisses the concerns of 'whistleblower' William McNeilly who said there were breaches of safety procedures at the submarine base on the Clyde.Mr Fallon said the claims had been looked into and there was no safety risk to the base or vessels.He told the House of Commons: &quot;Having now completed our investigation, and having consulted with the appropriate regulatory and operating authorities, I can assure the House that neither the operational effectiveness of our Continuous at Sea Deterrent nor the safety of our submariners or members of the public have been compromised.&quot;He said the only complaint form Able seaman McNeilly that needed further investigation was e-cigarettes being used.Mr Salmond SNP foreign Affairs spokesman however warned against complacency and requested further action.He said: &quot;This statement still leaves many questions to be answered and the paramount issues of safety at Faslane and the duty of care to MoD personnel must be addressed fully by the MoD.&quot;The SNP will continue to keep the pressure on the government until we are satisfied that not only have they have investigated Mr McNeilly's claims thoroughly and have acted on the findings but that those findings are put into the public domain.&quot;It is bad enough that Scotland is forced to house these weapons of mass destruction but these alleged breaches of security are deeply worrying. There must be absolutely no complacency.&quot;

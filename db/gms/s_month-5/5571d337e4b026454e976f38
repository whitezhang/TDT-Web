EDUCATION bosses are investigating how a young boy was left at a safari park on a school trip.
 The five-year-old was left behind at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling on Monday afternoon when a bus left to return children to Pitcorthie Primary and Nursery in Dunfermline, Fife. 
When teachers noticed the boy was missing they called police and the safari park, and the boy was found in the children's play area.
 Fife Council said they are treating the incident &quot;extremely seriously&quot; and have started an investigation. 
Police said they were called to the park and the boy was quickly returned to his family.
Peter McNaughton, head of education and children's services at the council, said: &quot;We are treating this incident extremely seriously and an investigation has been launched.
&quot;As soon as the child was noted as missing, immediate action was taken to contact Blair Drummond Safari Park and the police.
&quot;We have been in contact with the child's parents and communication with the family is ongoing.&quot;
 A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: &quot;Police in Stirling were called to Blair Drummond Safari &amp; Adventure Park at 3.30pm on Monday following reports of a missing child. 
&quot;Officers attended, however the child was quickly traced and was safely returned to the care of his family.&quot;

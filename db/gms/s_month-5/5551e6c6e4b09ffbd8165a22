An 11-year-old world champion mini stock car driver who was seriously injured in a crash has died. Â Keir Millar, from Lockerbie, was hurt in a race at Lochgelly Raceway in Fife on Saturday. He was taken to hospital in Edinburgh and his family said tonight that he had since died. In a statement issued through NHS Lothian they asked for space and time to grieve. They said: &quot;Due to the injuries sustained in an accident at the weekend Keir has sadly passed away. &quot;We, as a family, request space and time to grieve in private.&quot; Keir took part in the Ministox racing series and last year won the Ninja Kart Championship in England. A race at Lochgelly later this week has been cancelled out of respect.

PARENTS of pupils at an overcrowded primary are telling council bosses "we need a new school".Nearly 18 months on from the beginning of a consultation to fix cramped conditions at Hillhead Primary, education chiefs have still not solved the issue.Now they have ditched plans agreed earlier this year to convert an underground car park into a dance studio.And instead Glasgow City Council proposes to create an outdoor classroom and terrace seating on soil embankments to create more space.Rachel Lowther, who is a parent and member of the Space For Hillhead campaign, said the proposals are nothing more than a &quot;sticking plaster&quot;.Ms Lowther said: &quot;We have been going back and forwards with the council now for 18 months to try to resolve this issue and it is getting to real crisis point.&quot;Of the plans to convert the underground car park and these plans to make more use the outdoor space, the new plans are definitely preferable.&quot;But they are nothing more than a sticking plaster.&quot;We need a new school or they need to substantially expand this school.&quot;Hillhead, on Otago Street, was opened three years ago following a merger with three other primary schools and was designed for 632 pupils.It currently has around 680 pupils and extracurricular space in the school, such as the library and ICT suite, has been turned into teaching space.As told in the Evening Times, parents have been consulting with the council to try to alleviate the problem.To address the chronic overcrowding in the long term, the council has redrawn the catchment area for the school and capped the intake of primary ones to 75.Other suggestions were debated, such as moving the P7 class to Hillhead High School, and closing or moving Kelvin Park Early Years Centre, but these were dropped.It also announced a scheme in December last year to convert an underground carpark into a dance and teaching space.This has now been dropped and a new raft of proposals will go to executive committee this week.The school's lobby extends out into the courtyard under a covered area beneath the staff room.New plans propose to dismantle the outer screen and move it as far out into the courtyard as possible to create an extra classroom.The council also proposes to install a covered outdoor classroom in the playground that can be used for teaching and at lunchtime for children to eat their packed lunches.It suggests installing terraced seating on soil embankments in the grounds to make an outdoor teaching space and social area.Plans also include putting in synthetic grass in areas of the playground and taking out landscaping to be replaced by concrete blocks.Councillor Stephen Curran, Executive Member for Education and Young People said: &quot;The new proposals are the result of further discussions with parents and the school staff as to the best use and change to the flexible space in the school.&quot;We said at the end of the consultation that we would continue to listen to parents and staff, take their views and ideas into consideration and that is what we have done.&quot;We have met with the parents and the new plans have been positively received.&quot;

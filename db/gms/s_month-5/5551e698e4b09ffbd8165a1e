AN EMACIATED dog with a Cypriot microchip was found in Uddingston.&nbsp;The Scottish SPCA is appealing for information after the male Shar Pei was discovered on Friday.The dog, who has been named Otis, is being looked after at the charity's Lanarkshire Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre in Hamilton.Inspector Kerry Friel said the dog was in a &quot;really bad way&quot;.She said: &quot;The dog is in a really bad way. He is emaciated, suffering from eye and ear infections and is arthritic. He can't walk far at all without collapsing.&quot;He has a microchip which comes from Cyprus but it hasn't been registered in the UK so we have been unable to trace his owners through this.&quot;The dog has been neutered and the vet thinks he is around eight years old. We want to find out how he came to be in this awful state and are appealing to anyone who recognises him and knows who may have owned him to contact us.&quot;Causing an animal unnecessary suffering is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006.Anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.Anyone with information is being urged to contact the Scottish SPCA animal helpline on 03000 999 999.

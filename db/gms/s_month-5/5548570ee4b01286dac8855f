ONE of Scotland's largest social care charities has hosted a political debate at is centre in Glasgow.Quarriers invited Labour's Ken McIntosh, Gavin Newlands of the SNP and Liberal Democrat Garry McLelland to attend the event at its epilepsy centre.The session gave people a chance to learn more about the general election and put their questions to the guest politicians.Topics raised included welfare reform, communication and physical accessibility and disability hate crime.Speaking at the William Quarrier Scottish Epilepsy Centre, Iain Cuthbertson, Inclusion Manager at Quarriers, said: &quot;It's been a very useful day for the people we support and we'd like to thank Ken, Gavin and Gary for taking the time to come and speak to us.&quot;Issues such as welfare reform and disability hate crime can have a significant impact on the lives of those we support, so it's important we engage with politicians and other stakeholders to ensure their views are being received at all levels of society.&quot;This is going to be one of the most important general elections for many years and we believe everyone should be deeply engaged and involved in the process. Events like this are vital to people with disabilities, encouraging engagement with the political agenda of these parties and inclusion. Our group acknowledged the work of those parties who had drawn up 'Easy Read' versions of their Manifesto and found the day extremely insightful ahead of casting their votes on 7 May.&quot;

@patersonHTSTEWART PATERSONDAVID Cameron's plans for the next year will be set out in the Queen's Speech today in parliament.Bills on more powers for Scotland, a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Union and plans to reform trade union laws to make it harder for workers to strike are all expected to be announced.The new Tory majority government's plans on more powers for Scotland are eagerly anticipated.The Tories have been consistent in their statements that it will deliver what was agreed in the Smith Commission talks, while Nicola Sturgeon has said the UK Government must go further following the election of 56 SNP MPs.Two of the Bills expected in the speech could have a bearing on whether or not there is another referendum on independence.The First Minister has said there would need to be a change in circumstances and for the people to want a referendum.She has previously cited failure to deliver on more powers and Scotland being taken out of the EU against its will as possible changes.Ms Sturgeon wants more powers over the economy and employment law and what is announced will set the tone for future relations between the Scottish and UK governments.She said: &quot;We will seek greater powers for Scotland. We want to ensure that the recommendations of the Smith Commission are met in full. We are also seeking additional responsibilities - beyond the ones which the Smith Commission identified.&quot;In particular, greater power over business taxes, employment and trade union law, the minimum wage and welfare would enable us to create jobs, grow the economy, and lift people out of poverty.&quot;These are not powers for their own sake - they are powers to enable us to work more effectively in partnership with business to boost growth, to increase investment, to support employment and to deliver better jobs.&quot;The EU referendum will take place before 2017 and while Labour SNP and the Conservative policy is to stay in there are many Euro sceptics in the Conservative Party who would campaign for withdrawalThe strike laws will be delivered by mew business secretary Sajid Javid including a ban on strike action unless 40% of all eligible union members vote in favour.Chris Stephens, SNP MP for Glasgow South West, said the strike law proposals were an attack on the public sector and the trade union movement.He said: &quot;It is a step backwards for workers rights. This is a move to hamstring public sector workers.&quot;Ultimately it means a commitment to the continuation of a low wage economy.&quot;The strongest part of the trade union movement is in the public sector and they are clearly targeting health, transport and public services.&quot;It is an outright attack on public sector workers.&quot;

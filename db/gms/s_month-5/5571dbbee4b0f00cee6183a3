A HORRIFIED grandad took his grandson to a public toilet – and found nine used syringes.
Eddie McKenna made the disgusting find close to Glasgow’s Barras market on Sunday. 
Eddie, of Hamilton, said: “There were spots of blood all over the place.”
Glasgow City Council, who own the loo, refused to comment. 
It’s run by cleaning firm Healthmatic.

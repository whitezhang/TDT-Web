EIGHT men have been arrested in a major crackdown on drug dealers in the North-east of Scotland.
Around 40 officers and sniffer dogs stormed properties in Aberdeenshire this week as part of Operation Hotspur.
They seized a four-figure sum of drugs during the raids in Peterhead and Fraserburgh.
The two-day operation saw three local men appear at Peterhead Sheriff Court yesterday, along with three men aged 36, 28, and 27, from Liverpool.
Four more men from the area, aged 48, 20, 19 and 18 were charged in connection with the supply of drugs and are expected to appear at the court today.
Police said the raids were in direct response to tip-offs from the public.
Detective Inspector Stewart Mackie, who led the operation, said: “We will continue to work with various partners to pro-actively tackle this issue and provide support to any vulnerable people and local families affected.
“Enforcement is key to the success of Operations such as this and out success over the past two days continues to demonstrate that we are targeting the right people who bring misery to so many.”

A zoo in Japan has apologised for naming a baby monkey Charlotte after the newborn British princess following complaints from the Japanese public.Takasakiyama Natural Zoological Garden was flooded with calls and emails hours after it announced the name for its first-born monkey of the year, a tradition at the city-run zoo in southern Japan.Charlotte was the top choice in a public ballot, receiving 59 votes out of 853 cast in just over a month until yesterday, when the female macaque monkey was born.Opponents said giving the princess's name to a monkey is disrespectful to the British royal family.Despite the apology the zoo is considering sticking with Charlotte. Officials said they also received support for the name and views are divided.The British Embassy in Tokyo declined to comment.

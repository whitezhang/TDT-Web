The former boxer Scott Harrison is to be extradited to Spain over assault charges on the Costa Del Sol in 2012.
The 37-year old former WBO Featherweight Champion was sentenced to four years in prison by a Spanish court.
It is claimed he left Spain before starting his sentence, prompting Spanish authorities to issue a European Arrest Warrant.
Sheriff Thomas Welsh QC made the order at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Harrison, of Mount Florida in Glasgow, has fought the extradition request over several months.
His defence advocate, Niall NcCluskey, has seven days in which to consider an appeal.

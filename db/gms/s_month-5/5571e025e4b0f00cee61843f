A SEX beast who repeatedly raped two babies and sexually assaulted a girl of nine was yesterday warned he faces a lengthy prison sentence.
Twisted Stuart Young, 37, of Edinburgh’s Sighthill, was convicted after a week-long trial.
He raped a day-old boy in 2013 and the abuse continued until the baby was three months, the court heard.
Judge Paul Arthurson told Young: “You have been convicted of some truly depraved and despicable crimes. You should expect a sentence to reflect your level of criminality.”
Evil Young preyed the helpless kids – who cannot be named for legal reasons – at various addresses in Edinburgh between November 2008 and December 2013.
His sickening abuse of a baby girl started when she was six months old in 2008. He continued to rape her until she was five.
In July 2013, he sexually assaulted a nine-year-old girl after watching Braveheart.
She told the High Court in Edinburgh the abuse left her feeling “disgusted”.
Young, who had denied the charges, swore as he left the dock.
He was put on the sex offenders’ register and will be sentenced next month.

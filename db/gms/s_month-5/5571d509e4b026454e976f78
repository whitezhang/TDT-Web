A FORMER soldier has been found dead in his van in a gunshot tragedy – weeks after becoming a father for the second time.
Friends of David Glover, 28, discovered his body after spotting blood on the van’s windscreen.
Hours earlier, a message appeared on David’s Facebook page that said simply: “I am sorry.”
David served in Kuwait with the Royal Scots Borderers (1 Scots) and worked as a joiner after leaving the Army. He and partner Lisa Marr had just had a son, Max.
Police yesterday described his death near his home in Ormiston, East Lothian, as unexplained. It’s understood they are not treating it as suspicious and are not looking for anyone else.
 


David’s mother wrote online of his “torment” and “dark patches” in his life.
 He split with partner Kathryn Archbold, mother of his older son Lewis, last year, before appearing in court charged with punching her in the face in 2011. 
David’s mum Grace Hoggan wrote on a Facebook tribute page to her son: “My baby, my love, my soulmate. I absolutely adore you. I hope your soul’s at peace. No more torment.
“I wish I could have helped you through the dark patches. I love you so much. My darling boy.”
One of David’s old army buddies, Jamie Aitken, wrote: “You were a great guy with loads to give. I’m sure I speak for 1 Scots in saying you were a star that burned out early.”
 

Flowers and messages for David were left at the scene of the tragedy.
Police said: “We are investigating following the discovery of a man’s body on Tynemount Road, Ormiston.
“The incident occurred on Monday at about 9.25pm. Inquires are ongoing. A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal.”
 David’s family were too upset to comment. Kathryn was unavailable but had changed her Facebook profile picture to a photo of David and Lewis.

A GROUP of homeless workers in dispute with the city council have handed back their long service awards in protest.Around 70 staff have been on strike for more than a week in a lengthy pay grade row.Nearly 20 had been presented with awards to mark service of more than two decades with one having worked for the local authority for more than 40 years.They met at the City Chambers and returned their certificates to mark their unhappiness at failure to bring the dispute to an end.Ian Leech, Unison convenor, said: &quot;Those strikers with council long service awards are so disgusted at the way they are being treated that they handed back their awards on mass.&quot;It shows how strong the mood is amongst these members. The strike is 100% solid. They aren't going away. All they are looking for is to be treated the same as the other 400 social care staff who do a similar job.&quot;The homelessness case workers argue they do a job equivalent to caseworkers in other departments who are on a higher pay grade, taking home &pound;5000 a year more.Brian Smith, Unison's Glasgow branch secretary, said: &quot;About 20 members have long service awards.&quot;Some have over 20 years service, six or seven have over 30 years and one started work when she was 17 and now has 48 years service.&quot;In total the 70 strikers have over 1,200 years' service between them. Council workers receive a long service certificate after twenty years and a small gift after thirty years.Mr Smith said: &quot;The people with the long service awards have a lot of years service between them but feel management isn't listening to their legitimate claims. They are very angry and disappointed.&quot;Unison insistes the council has refused to come up with a solution to resolve the dispute.The workers, who have nearly 3000 people on their caseloads, assess the needs of homeless people and families across Glasgow, organise crucial support and help to access and maintain emergency, temporary and permanent accommodation.A council spokesman said: &quot;It is extremely disappointing Unison has resorted to industrial action.&quot;Unison's case for homelessness staff to be re-graded at a higher level was reviewed on three separate occasions by the council and each time the case was dismissed.&quot;Casework staff are graded at an appropriate level as they work to arrange accommodation for individuals while detailed care assessments are undertaken by other social work staff.&quot;A contingency plan has been put in place and any disruption to this service for vulnerable people will be kept to a minimum.&quot;

A DRUNK businessman who sparked an airline emergency after watching Manchester United has been fined &pound;1000.
Graham Leonard’s trip to Old Trafford turned sour when his celebrations caused an alert at Aberdeen airport.
Boisterous Leonard had tried to sing football songs through the public address system on the flight home and, once inside the airport, triggered a fire alarm sparking an emergency evacuation and shutdown.
Yesterday father-of-two Leonard, 46, who runs his own painting and decorating firm, appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court and was fined and told to carry out 140 hours of unpaid work.
He will also be supervised by social services for six months and was told by sheriff Edward Savage the punishment was a direct alternative to jail.
At an earlier hearing the court was told Leonard was a successful businessman in the city who has regularly joined other well-heeled fans on charter flights to Old Trafford and other grounds around the world to support the Red Devils.
On Sunday, March 15, Leonard left Aberdeen to see his team beat Tottenham Hotspur 3-0 in a Premier League fixture. Before the game, Leonard and fellow passengers had enjoyed hospitality at a Manchester hotel, where former United stars were present.
Leonard, of Newmachar, Aberdeenshire, admitted behaving recklessly or negligently and “endangering an aircraft” by using the PA system and striking one of the flight crew on the head with a wet towel.
Outside the court room Leonard said: “I’m sorry for any embarrassment caused to friends and family and I just want to put the matter behind me.”

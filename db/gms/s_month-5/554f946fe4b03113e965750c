A 27-year-old man is in a stable condition in hospital after being stabbed in a &quot;random&quot; attack in the Gorbals area of Glasgow.
Police said the man and three friends left a pub just after midnight and were walking along Gorbals Street.
They were approached by two young men and two women. 
Officers said there was an &quot;altercation&quot; between one of the men and the 27-year-old man which resulted in him being stabbed.
The suspect is described as white and in his late teens or early 20s. He had a local accent and was wearing a dark puffa jacket. 
Det Con Mark Hendry said: &quot;This attack is completely random, there was some sort of altercation prior to the attack and we are in the process of establishing the exact circumstances around that.
&quot;However, a 27-year-old man has been seriously assaulted with no clear motive when on a night out with friends and it's imperative we trace those responsible. 
&quot;This is a busy thoroughfare with many people either on foot or in cars or taxis - if you think you saw anything or have any knowledge of the crime or the suspects which could assist our investigation, please do get in touch.&quot;

A HUGE search operation has been launched to trace a missing American tourist who disappeared four days ago.
Police say there is &quot;great concern&quot; for Susan McLean, 61, who went missing from her holiday lodge in Aberfeldy, Perthshire, on Sunday.
A police helicopter, mountain rescue teams and search dogs have been deployed in a bid to find Ms McLean who was last seen on CCTV outside the grounds of the Moness Resort in Crieff Road.Officers today thanked the public for the help they have given the inquiry so far.
Chief Inspector Ian Scott, local area commander for Perth and Kinross, said: &quot;A number of people have come forward with information and our engagement with residents and visitors in Aberfeldy has been very positive.
&quot;I want to thank the public and the local community for their assistance. The information that they have given to our inquiry team has led us to undertake additional inquiries and has instigated further searches in the area.
 

&quot;It is obvious from the response we have had that there is great concern in the community for Susan's well-being.&quot;
Officers have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries, visiting local businesses, looking at CCTV and distributing posters around the town as they continue to hunt for Ms McLean.
Their searches have focused on the areas of Aberfeldy Golf Club, Aberfeldy Community Hospital and Birks O' Aberfeldy.
When last seen, the holidaymaker, from Pennsylvania, was wearing a black and grey waterproof jacket, beige khaki trousers and white trainers.
 

She is 5ft 8in, of medium build, with short fair hair, green eyes and an American accent.
&quot;I would urge anyone who may have seen Susan or anyone who remembers someone with an American accent who matches her description to contact Police Scotland on 101 or speak to any officer,&quot; said Mr Scott.

A RECKLESS fire-raiser was on the run today after torching a Turkish barber shop in Glasgow.Neighbours raised the alarm after smoke and flames were spotted coming from the premises in the city centre late last night.Police today revealed the blaze, which swept through the barber shop in Cambridge Street, had been started deliberately.Extensive damage was caused to the inside of Gogo’s, and firefighters were forced to drag smouldering furnishings from the shop.Families from seven flats above the shop had to be evacuated and senior officers warned the blaze could have been deadly.Police Scotland has launched a probe and officers are treating the incident as wilful fire-raising.Detective Sergeant Alister Thom, who is leading the investigation, said: “This was a dangerous act and could easily have resulted in a more serious outcome.”Police want to trace a man who was seen in the area before the fire was started.He is described as between 40 and 50-years-old with a stocky build. The man was wearing a red jacket with a white T-shirt and blue jeans.Witnesses who may have seen the man loitering around the barber shop before 10pm yesterday have been urged to come forward.Detective Sergeant Thom added: “Our investigations are at early stage but I am keen to speak to a male seen in the area shortly before the fire was reported.“The male is described as between 40 and 50 years old with a stocky build.“He was wearing a red jacket with a white t-shirt and blue jeans.“I would ask this man or anyone who saw him, or anything suspicious to contact police.”Dozens of firefighters arrived at the scene, near Buccleuch Street, shortly before 10pm last night.The torched barber shop remained closed this morning and the security shutters were down.Charred barber chairs were among the blackened debris left outside the Cambridge Street shop.No-one was injured in the fire and the evacuated residents were allowed to return to their homes a short time later.Anyone with any information about the fire is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.&nbsp;&nbsp;
